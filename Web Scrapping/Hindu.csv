0,"April 08, 2022",18:11 IST,business,industry,Cabinet allows PSUs to surrender non-operational coal mines," The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) on Thursday approved the Coal Ministry's proposal to give Central and State public sector undertakings (PSU) a one-time window to surrender non-operational coal mines without penalty, the government said on Friday. The CCEA, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had taken the decision at Thursday evening's meeting.  The government said in a statement that the PSUs would be allowed to surrender non-operational mines without giving any reason.  ""This may release several coal mines which the present government PSU allottees are not in a position to develop or are disinterested and could be auctioned as per the present auction policy. Three months’ time will be granted to the allottee government companies to surrender the coal mines from the date of publication of the approved surrender policy,"" the government statement read.  The government said that after the Supreme Court order on cancellation of coal blocks in 2014, many of those blocks had been allotted to PSUs. ""The allocation route was expeditious and it was expected that the coal requirement of State GENCOs would be met from those blocks... Given the context of allocation of coal blocks at that point of time, conditions for times lines for operationalisation of coal blocks were very stringent and firm leaving no wriggle room either to the successful allottee or the nominated authority. Penalisation for delay in operationalisation of coal mines has resulted in disputes and court cases,"" the statement read.  It added that as of December 2021, 45 out of the 73 mines allotted to PSUs remained non-operational. ""Delays were due to reasons beyond the control of allottees, for example, law and order issues; enhancement in the area of forest from what was declared earlier; resistance of land-holders against land acquisition; geological surprises in terms of availability of coal resources,"" the government said.  It added that the CCEA's decision would lead to the coal blocks being offered under the recently launched commercial coal mines auction policy.",The Hindu Bureau,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/cabinet-allows-psus-to-surrender-non-operational-coal-mines/article65302956.ece
1,"April 08, 2022",11:17 IST,business,industry,RBI Monetary Policy | Repo rate left unchanged at 4%," The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on April 8, based on an assessment of the macroeconomic situation and the outlook, voted unanimously to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 4%.  “The MPC also unanimously decided to remain accommodative while focussing on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth,” RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said while making the announcement. The marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the bank rate remain unchanged at 4.25%. Further, the Reserve Bank has decided to restore the width of the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) corridor to 50 basis points, the position that prevailed before the pandemic. “The floor of the corridor will now be provided by the newly instituted standing deposit facility (SDF), which will be placed 25 basis points below the repo rate, i.e., at 3.75%,” he said. Explaining the MPC’s rationale for its decision on the policy rate and the stance, he said the expected positive benefits from the ebbing Omicron wave have been offset by the sharp escalation in geopolitical tensions. “This has significantly changed the external and domestic landscape. Concerns over protracted supply disruptions have rattled global commodity and financial markets, given the significant share of the two economies engaged in war in global production and exports of key commodities like oil and natural gas; wheat and corn; palladium, aluminium and nickel; edible oils; and fertilizers. Global crude oil prices briefly crossed US$ 130 per barrel, touching their highest level since 2008 and remain volatile at elevated levels, despite some correction,” he added. “Global food prices, along with metal and other commodity prices, have also hardened significantly. Risk aversion towards assets of emerging market economies (EMEs) has increased, leading to large capital outflows and a depreciating bias in their currencies. These developments have, first, ratcheted up the projections of global inflation, which was already running well above targets in major countries; and second, will produce sizeable adverse impact on output across geographies,” he said. Emphasising that geopolitical tensions have exacerbated at a time when the global economy was grappling with a sharp rise in inflation and consequent monetary policy normalisation in major advanced economies, he said global supply chain disruptions and input cost pressures are now expected to linger even longer.  “The resurgence of COVID-19 infections in some major economies in March and the associated lockdowns run the risk of further aggravating the global supply bottlenecks and input cost pressures. World trade and output and hence external demand are likely to be weaker than envisaged two months ago,” he said. Overall, the external developments during the past two months have led to the materialisation of downside risks to the domestic growth outlook and upside risks to inflation projections presented in the February MPC resolution, he noted. Inflation is now projected to be higher and growth lower than the assessment in February. Economic activity, although recovering, is barely above its pre-pandemic level, he added. The governor said as the horizon was brightening up, escalating geopolitical tensions have cast a shadow on our economic outlook. Under this circumstances the real GDP growth for 2022-23 is now projected at 7.2% with Q1:2022-23 at 16.2%; Q2 at 6.2%; Q3 at 4.1%; and Q4 at 4.0%, assuming crude oil (Indian basket) at US$ 100 per barrel during 2022-23, Mr. Das said. Similarly, inflation is now projected at 5.7% in 2022-23, with Q1 at 6.3%; Q2 at 5.8%; Q3 at 5.4%; and Q4 at 5.1%. In his opening remarks, he observed, “We are confronted with new but humungous challenges – shortages in key commodities; fractures in the international financial architecture; and fears of deglobalisation. Extreme volatility characterises commodity and financial markets.” “While the pandemic quickly morphed from a health crisis to one of life and livelihood, the conflict in Europe has the potential to derail the global economy. Caught in the cross-current of multiple headwinds, our approach needs to be cautious but proactive in mitigating the adverse impact on India’s growth, inflation and financial conditions,” he added. “We are, however, reassured by the strong buffers that we have built over the past few years, including large foreign exchange reserves, significant improvement in external sector indicators and substantial strengthening of the financial sector, all of which would help us to weather this storm. Once again, we in the RBI stand resolute and in readiness to defend the economy and navigate out of the current storm,” he further added.",Lalatendu Mishra,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/rbi-keeps-lending-rates-unchanged/article65302154.ece
2,"April 08, 2022",09:32 IST,business,industry,"Amazon objecting to union’s victory in New York, alleging interference"," Amazon.com accused the new
union at a New York City warehouse of threatening workers unless
they voted to organise, an assertion an attorney for the labour
group called ""really absurd."" (Sign up to our Technology newsletter, Today’s Cache, for insights on emerging themes at the intersection of technology, business and policy. Click here to subscribe for free.) A second labour group, the Retail, Wholesale and Department
Store Union (RWDSU), which was losing a bid to organise an
Amazon warehouse in Alabama, also filed objections on Thursday
to that union election. The U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is giving
Amazon until April 22 to back up its objections to last week'selection in New York, in which Staten Island workers voted toform the company's first U.S. union. Amazon had requested extra
time to provide evidence because its objections are
""substantial,"" it said in a filing Wednesday. A certified election result would give organised labour a
foothold in the United States' second-largest private employer,
with the potential to alter how Amazon manages its finely tuned
operation. Some 55% of workers who voted in the election at Amazon's
JFK8 warehouse in the New York City borough of Staten Island
opted to join the Amazon Labor Union (ALU), which has demanded
higher pay and job security. Since the result, U.S. workers from
another 50 Amazon sites have contacted the union, the group's
leader has said. Among Amazon's planned objections to the outcome are that
the ALU interfered with employees in line to vote and that long
waits depressed turnout, Amazon's filing said. Some 58% of
eligible voters cast ballots in person over several days. Eric Milner, an attorney representing the ALU from law firm
Simon & Milner, dismissed Amazon's claims as false and said they
would be overruled. ""To say that the Amazon Labor Union was threatening
employees is really absurd,"" he said. ""The Amazon Labor Union is
Amazon employees."" Separately on Thursday, the RWDSU objected to the electionin Bessemer, Alabama, in which Amazon workers voted againstunionising. It was the second election in Bessemer, after the
NLRB determined that Amazon had improperly interfered in the
first contest there last year. The most recent outcome is
pending in light of hundreds of challenged ballots and now the
RWDSU's objections, which could delay a result for months. Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said, “We want our
employees’ voices to be heard, and we hope the NLRB counts every
valid vote.” In a filing, the RWDSU said Amazon unlawfully removed
pro-union literature from non-work areas and terminated an
employee who spoke in favour of the union during mandatory work
meetings, among other objections. The RWDSU said these were
grounds for the NLRB to set aside the result. Amazon itself took issue with the RWDSU's conduct, such as
the union's communications with workers around the use of a
mailbox on warehouse property, adding that its filing objections
is standard process. The retailer faces a high bar in demonstrating that the New
York union violated rules for engagement with employees that
influenced the outcome, said John Logan, a labor professor at
San Francisco State University. In addition, the NLRB typically treats employers' alleged
violations more seriously than alleged wrongdoing by unions
because companies have greater power over workers, he said. ""It's going to be really tough"" for Amazon, he said.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/amazon-objecting-to-unions-victory-in-new-york-alleging-interference/article65302030.ece

The company, whose existing plant in the State is at Ameenpur, near Hyderabad, has been allotted 48.53 acres at the Bandathimmapur Food Processing Park, Siddipet district, by Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation for the proposed facility. It will be a state-of-the-art, digitally enabled, automated, smart factory to manufacture juices, enhanced water, packaged water as well as sparkling beverages and expected to be ready for commercial production at the end of 2023. HCCB will be investing ₹600 crore on the first phase followed by another ₹400 crore in subsequent phases over the next five years, Telangana Industries and IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao told a programme here on Thursday in which the company also entered into three memoranda of understanding with the State government.  Women will constitute 50% of the workforce at the new factory, he said, assuring the company of support and expeditious approvals. Urging the beverage maker to launch Indianised products, the Minister said the government could facilitate local sourcing of mangoes and sweet lime for the company, something that will benefit the producers too. “The prevailing industrial ecosystem and industrial climate in Telangana has encouraged them to double the manufacturing capacity. This [new] factory will provide capacity for next ten years of sales foreseen in the region,” Mr. Rao said. Chairman and CEO Neeraj Garg said, “We value the support and encouragement we receive from the State... will shortly begin work on the new greenfield [project].” While 300 direct jobs are to be created, the multiplier effect of the factory by way of indirect jobs, local sourcing will be higher.  To queries, senior executives of HCCB said water for the factory, just like for other units at the Food Park, will come from Kaleswaram project. On production capacity of the factory and quantum of water required, they said granular details were being worked out. The memoranda of understanding, signed in the presence of the Minister and Chief Commercial Officer, Bottling Investments Group of the Coca-Cola Company Juan Pablo Rodriguez, pertains to capacity building of organisations in the areas of water; solid waste management; and skill building.  HCCB in a release said it will conduct capacity building for existing and upcoming water use intensive industries in Telangana to improve water efficiency and enhance wastewater management and reuse as well as to improve solid waste management.

The increases come on the back of the government more than doubling natural gas prices to $6.1 per million British thermal unit from April 1. Natural gas when compressed becomes CNG for use as fuel in automobiles. The same gas is also piped to household kitchens and industries for cooking and other purposes.  The increase in CNG prices follows ₹10 per litre hike in petrol and diesel prices in 16 days and a ₹50 per cylinder raise in the cooking gas LPG rates. A record 137-day hiatus in petrol and diesel price revision ended on March 22. On the same day, the price of a 14.2-kg LPG cylinder was increased to ₹949.50 in the national capital.

5,"April 06, 2022",22:08 IST,business,industry,BPCL buys 2 million barrels of Russian Urals for May loading,"  Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd has bought 2 million barrels of Russian Urals for May loading from trader Trafigura, two sources familiar with the purchase said. Refiners in India, the world's third biggest oil importer and consumer, have been snapping up Russian oil through spot deals since Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, taking advantage of deep discounts as other buyers back away. BPCL and Trafigura did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The state-run refiner regularly buys Russian Urals for its 310,000 barrels per day (bpd) Kochi refinery in southern India. With BPCL's purchase, India has so far booked at least 16 million barrels of Russian oil since Feb. 24, similar to imports in all of 2021, according to Reuters calculations. The Urals discount to dated Brent has hit a record for the post-Soviet era as some buyers shunned Russian oil. Unlike several Western countries, India has not banned Russian oil imports. India's foreign minister S. Jaishankar said on Wednesday the government was working to stabilise economic transactions with Russia, a day after India condemned killings of civilians in Ukraine and called for an independent probe. Mr. Jaishankar told lawmakers in Parliament that Russia continued to be a critical economic partner and efforts were underway to ""stabilise economic transactions between India and Russia."" India's finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman last week said India would buy Russian oil if available at a discount. ""India's overall interest is what is kept in mind ...

7,"April 06, 2022",20:44 IST,business,industry,"Some Indian refiners set to cut May Saudi oil, snap up Russian barrels"," At least two Indian refiners plan to buy less Saudi oil than usual in May, after the kingdom raised the official selling price (OSP) to record highs for Asia, two sources said on Wednesday, as India increases purchases of cheap Russian crude. India, the world's third biggest oil importer and consumer, has been hit hard by rising crude values, with pump prices in some States touching record highs. State oil producer Saudi Aramco, the world's top oil exporter, has raised crude prices for all regions, with
those to Asia hitting all-time highs. The Middle East accounts for the bulk of India's oil imports, with Iraq and Saudi Arabia the top two suppliers to Asia's third largest economy. The sources at the two Indian refiners declined to be named, citing confidentiality. They did not disclose the volumes refiners would buy, and said the reductions in May would be marginal because they have to lift the amount they have committed to under annual contracts. To mitigate the rising cost of oil imports, India has turned to Russian barrels that are available at a deep discount to the dated Brent benchmark , citing ""national interests"". Some companies and countries have shunned Russian crude after the country began its invasion of Ukraine on February 24. Moscow refers to the conflict as a ""special military operation"". Indian refiners have bought at least 16 million barrels of cheaper Russian oil for May loading on a delivered basis, similar to purchases for the whole of 2021, according to Reuters calculations. The companies have mostly bought Russian Urals, a grade similar in quality to medium sour crude produced in the Middle East and West Africa, mainly Angola. Ehsan Ul Haq, an analyst from Refinitiv, said rising purchases of Russian crude meant India would likely buy less from Middle Eastern suppliers, including spot purchases of grades such as Iraq's Basra oil. In turn, more Gulf crude, as well as some West African blends could end up in Europe, one of the Indian refiner sources said. ""Apart from altering trade flows, shifts in buying patters will likely raise freight costs because there will be long-haul journeys,"" Mr. Haq said. Although Russian imports were meeting only a small fraction of India's overall needs, he said they were significant for Russia as it loses market share in traditional European markets.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/business/some-indian-refiners-set-to-cut-may-saudi-oil-snap-up-russian-barrels/article65297053.ece

A Bench of Acting Chief Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Navin Chawla issued notice to the Centre through Ministries of Home Affairs, Law and Justice and Finance, and asked them to respond to the petition.  Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma, representing the Centre, submitted that the petitioner has raised a serious issue which shall be looked into by the government.  The court, which listed the matter for further hearing on May 25, asked the Centre to “seriously look into the issue” raised by the petitioner.  Petitioner and advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay raised loop holes in the system in relation to transfer of foreign funds which could be used by separatists, Naxals, Maoists, fundamentalists, and terrorists.  During the hearing, the ASG said, “He [petitioner] has raised a serious issue. We will consider it and get back. The issues are serious and important, they do require detailed consideration.” The petition sought direction to ensure that Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS), National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) and Instant Money Payment System (IMPS) are not used for depositing foreign money in Indian banks. The petitioner said it is not only harming the foreign exchange reserve of India but is also being used to provide money to separatists, fundamentalists, Naxals, Maoists, terrorists, traitors, conversion mafias and radical organisations like the SIMI and PFI.  He submitted that immigration rules for a visa are the same whether a foreigner comes in business class or economy class, uses Air India or British Airways, and comes from USA or Uganda.

Specifically, prices for chemicals, energy, fabric, foodstuff and metals were higher than February and the overall rate of inflation faced by producers quickened.  “Output prices rose in March as goods producers sought to share a part of the additional input cost burden with customers, taking the charge inflation to a five-month high,” S&P Global said.  “For now, demand has been sufficiently strong to withstand price hikes, but should inflation continue to gather pace we may see a more significant slowdown, if not an outright contraction in sales,” said Ms. De Lima, economics associate director at S&P Global, noting that the latest PMI indicates weakening manufacturing sector growth in India in the last month of the financial year.  After three successive months of shedding jobs, the manufacturing sector saw ‘a broad stabilisation in headcounts’ but firms indicated that payroll numbers were sufficient to cope with current requirements, dampening prospects for new jobs.  Anecdotal evidence indicated that inflation concerns and economic uncertainty dampened overall confidence, the firm said in a note on the Index which is based on responses from 400 manufacturers and adjusted for seasonal variations thereafter.  Additional input purchases in March grew at the weakest pace since August 2021, but was still ‘marked’. Yet, pre-production inventories rose for the ninth month in a row, recording a sharper and quicker uptick than February. On the other hand, constraints on suppliers appeared to ease, as delivery times lengthened by the shortest extent in almost a year, S&P Global said.

15,"April 03, 2022",23:13 IST,business,industry,Protecting man’s best friend," Whatsapp, especially the groups in it, gives you a never-before insight into people’s lives and pastimes. Amid isolating COVID restrictions, these groups have been the congregating points where movie recommendations abound and cooking and yoga conversations roll by regularly. A conversation some time ago made me pause. A friend had an ailing pet dog and he suffered with it through its final losing fight with cancer. He found ample support among the group members as he cremated it in tears.  As pet parents will tell you, pets are family. Pet ownership in India has increased during the past two years of unbelievable isolation, confinement and distress. And pets have been attributed with shoring up the sanity and safety of their human parents. Pet-upkeep facilities such as food, grooming and medical care are quite widely prevalent and even pet spas and hotels are coming up in cities.  With the costs associated with maintaining a pet and, of course, the contingencies, pet insurance can’t be far behind and correctly so. Several general insurance companies offer comprehensive insurance coverage for your household pet, typically for pet dogs and cats while pet-bird insurance is also available. Ranging from protection from theft and medical-care costs, pet insurance policies offer intuitive covers including third-party liability. Different companies offer covers to pets in varying age bands from a few weeks to a few years. The breed, size and age of the pet dictates the premium rate as does its health history, vaccinations and the like. You can choose the sum insured (SI) for the policy and if you want to cover a pedigree dog for its purchase or market value, you need a certificate from the Kennel Club of India. The main cover is for the costs of hospitalisation and surgery with typical exclusions. Terminal illness cover is a benefit cover that pays a lump sum if your pet contracts one of the listed terminal illnesses such as cancer or kidney failure. A mortality-benefit cover pays you the sum insured if your pet passes away due to illness, accident or other specified causes. A benefit payment for cremation / burial expenses can also be part of this cover.  Out-patient treatment and long-term care covers are also available, covers that are actually not available or very difficult to get for humans.  Some companies offer add-on covers like forfeiture of entry fee for dog shows when the pet is unable to participate due to injury or illness. A valuable cover, certain to become a requisite in the future, is the third-party liability cover. Accidents involving your pet resulting in damage to third-party property, injury or death is covered under this for SIs ranging from ₹5 to ₹10 lakh and above.  The policy kicks in only when the compensation is awarded through the court, but we have been reading about victims filing cases against pet owners and some of you may have experienced risky and hair-raising situations in your own gated communities and apartment complexes. And, while we are talking about building societies and third-party liability, remember that your residents’ association has to cover itself against third-party liability for its lifts and this is a legal requirement in many states following tragic accidents.  All covers come with pre-requisite documentation and exclusions which you should read through and understand comprehensively.  Having done that, an optimum pet-insurance cover is highly advisable to protect the well-being and upkeep of your best friend and, by extension, your own interests.

16,"April 03, 2022",16:03 IST,business,industry,Goods exports up 33% from pre-pandemic levels: Piyush Goyal,"  India’s goods exports grew 43.2% in 2021-22 to nearly $418 billion dollars, rising over $125 billion over the COVID-hit year 2020-21, with March recording the highest ever outbound shipments worth $40.38 billion, the Commerce and Industry Ministry said on Sunday.  The record exports in the year gone by constituted a 33.33% surge over the pre-pandemic levels of 2019-20. Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said total exports were about 5% higher than the $400 billion target for the year, which had been crossed by March 21.  The government did not release data on imports that usually accompanies the official monthly export figures. Total merchandise imports had crossed $550 billion by February 2022, leading to a trade deficit of $175.75 billion in the first eleven months of the year. Goods imports in 2020-21 stood at $393.6 billion.  Addressing the media on India's historic export figures for FY 2021-22.#LocalGoesGlobalhttps://t.co/57Bhe9cGCK A bulk of the merchandise exports growth was attributed to engineering goods and agriculture products’ exports, both of which hit an all-time high in 2021-22. Engineering goods exports grew 46% over the year at $111 billion, of which about $16 billion worth goods were shipped to the U.S. alone. Agricultural exports are reckoned to have crossed $50 billion with a sharp growth in rice, wheat, marine products, coffee and dairy products.     “Even a pandemic like COVID-19 and the war like situation has not deterred our export target for the year. These results reflect what is possible when there is decisive leadership from a leader like PM Narendra Modi with a ‘whole of government’ and ‘whole of nation’ approach,” Mr. Goyal said.  The Minister stressed that the growth has occurred in products where small and medium enterprises are active as well as labour-intensive sectors like jute products, textiles, leather, gems and jewellery. Mr. Goyal said the government will continue to work hard to enhance exports from MSMEs and the farm sector and push job creation.  He also congratulated farmers for raising their productivity so that wheat exports have grown from 2 lakh tonnes in 2019-20 to 21.55 lakh tonnes last year and over 70 lakh tonnes in 2021-22. About half of this wheat was exported to Bangladesh largely through the Petrapole land border, said Commerce Secretary BVR Subrahmanyam.  “We will continue to export wheat in a big way to countries that have been affected by the conflict in Ukraine and Russia (major global wheat suppliers) and hope to export 100 lakh tonnes of wheat this year comfortably,” Mr. Goyal said.  Even though a part of the growth in exports may have been driven by rising commodity prices, the performance has been laudable, said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ICRA, who had expected full year exports to touch $415 billion.  Mr. Subrahmanyam pointed out that India is no longer just a primary goods exporter and commodities or raw materials that traditionally saw high exports have actually seen a decline in 2021-22, pointing to dipping iron ore and oilmeal exports.  “These are the areas where the government is deliberately saying we should manufacture here and export manufactured goods,” he said, adding that there was a greater impetus for finished goods and processed products. “In textiles, our exports are $35 billion of which raw cotton is just about $3 billion. The rest of it is processed. We have exported mobile phones worth $6 billion,”   “Other than raw cotton, other agricultural exports and iron ore, we are largely a processed goods exporter which is why it is very important for us to have free trade agreements with the developed world, so that value-added exports can grow and create jobs,” Mr. Goyal said.  Officials emphasised that the growth in shipments came from diversified industries, including sectors like electronics where India was a large importer and has clocked exports of $15.58 billion in 2021-22 compared to $11 billion in the previous year.  Some of the other sectors recording the highest growth included petroleum products largely exported to the UAE, drugs and pharmaceutical products with Netherlands as their biggest buyer. Bangladesh was the biggest importer of Indian chemicals, while China was the biggest procurer of gems and jewellery from India.  They also underlined that Indian products’ reach has spread wider with developed countries beginning to import significantly higher value goods.  “Indian exports were earlier dominated by neighbouring and ASEAN nations, but this year recorded a significant jump in exports to developed countries like the US, Netherlands, Hong Kong, Singapore, UK, Belgium and Germany,” said Santosh Sarangi, the Director General of Foreign Trade. “You will bear in mind there is a conflict situation going on because of which shipping lines are disturbed, container shortages are there and shipping costs have gone up. Trade and supply chains are affected worldwide, so the fact that we have crossed $40 billion exports in March with all these challenges gives us confidence,” the minister said, adding that the Free Trade Agreements with Australia and the UAE will help boost exports this year.  For setting the export target for this year, Mr. Goyal said export promotion councils will work out sectoral possibilities and Indian missions abroad will evaluate prospects in different importing nations, which will then be translated into an ‘ambitious target’.

17,"April 02, 2022",11:51 IST,business,industry,India-Australia deal seeks to double bilateral trade in 5 years,"  India and Australia signed an Economic Co-operation and Trade Agreement (ECTA) on Saturday in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his counterpart in Canberra Scott Morrison, with an eye on doubling bilateral trade to $50 billion in five years and ease movement of people, goods and services across borders.   The agreement with Australia, which Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal expects would create 10 lakh additional jobs in the country over the next five years, was described as a ‘watershed moment in bilateral ties’ by Mr. Modi.  “On the basis of this agreement, together, we will be able to increase the resilience of supply chains, and also contribute to the stability of the Indo-Pacific region,” he said about the deal that will facilitate work visas for two to four years for Indian students in Australia on a ‘reciprocal basis’ and allow Indian chefs and yoga professionals to work Down Under.  The trade and economic partnership deal with Australia, which is in the midst of a protracted trade battle with China, is a significant milestone at a time when the developed world is looking to hedge its supply chain dependence. A government statement noted that this is also the first such pact signed by India with a developed country in a decade.   Mr. Morrison said the deal “opens a big door into the world’s fastest growing major economy for Australian farmers, manufacturers, producers and so many more”.  Indian exports to Australia have been growing at a rapid clip and the agreement, which may be expanded further after its implementation in the current form, will facilitate zero duty access “on over 96% of Indian exports, including several labour-intensive industries,” Mr. Goyal said.  India will, in turn, offer preferential access to Australia on over 70% of its tariff lines on goods imports, including ‘lines of export interest to Australia which are primarily raw materials and intermediaries such as coal, mineral ores and wines, etc.’, the Commerce Ministry said.  In a joint statement with Mr. Morrison, Australia’s trade, tourism and industry minister Dan Trehan said: “Tariffs will be eliminated on more than 85% of Australian goods exports to India (valued at more than $12.6 billion a year), rising to almost 91% (valued at $13.4 billion) over 10 years.”  Poll worries and safeguards Talks with Australia for a possible trade and economic partnership pact had begun about a decade ago, but were aborted after a previous regime in Canberra asked India to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership instead. After India refused to join the RCEP, negotiations were stalled. Fresh parleys between the two sides began last September after Mr. Trehan visited India.  Australia, which goes to polls this year, has agreed to amend its tax laws to resolve India’s long-standing complaint that its firms providing technical services in the country are taxed on their offshore income. Both trade ministers said the electoral cycle will not impact the trade pact.  “Elections will come and go. I think nations survive beyond elections… In fact, my own party came into government in 2014. And I can share with you we never went back on a single decision concluded and finalised by the previous government,” said Mr. Goyal, stressing that both the countries’ governments work for the benefit of the people in national interest and their decisions are ‘permanent’.  With a rich repertoire of vineyards in Yarra Valley and beyond, Australia will now be able to export wine bottles of 750 ml, costing over $5 dollars, to India at a concessional import duty and the countries have agreed to set up a Joint Dialogue to work together on Wine-related trade issues. A working group will also be set up to resolve issues related to bilateral trade in whisky and other alcoholic beverages.   The Commerce Ministry said the agreement provides adequate safeguards to prevent circumvention and protect against a sudden surge in import of goods. It also said this is the first trade deal which includes a compulsory review mechanism after 15 years.  This is the second economic partnership pact signed within a week, following a similar deal with the United Arab Emirates last week. Mr. Goyal said more such deals are in the offing as India looks to accelerate its exports growth after crossing a record $400 billion in 2021-22.  “We are in very active dialogue with the United Kingdom, Canada, and have agreed to work on an interim agreement with both that can be done faster, followed by a comprehensive arrangement,” he said.   Talks with the European Union that began in July 2021 are also moving ahead with Commerce Secretary BVR Subrahmanyam expected to be in Brussels next week to firm up the timelines and scope of agreement.  “We are also in dialogue with Israel and we have received interest from the Gulf Co-operation Council to bring together all the six nations into a Comprehensive Economic Partnership with us,” the Minister noted.

20,"April 01, 2022",20:36 IST,business,industry,March auto sales throw up a mixed bag for the industry," March turned out to be a mixed bag for the automobile industry in India as shortage of electronic components continued to impact auto production in the country. While manufacturers such as Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai Motors posted a decline in wholesales, others such as Tata Motors, Skoda and Kia recorded their highest ever monthly wholesales. Market leader Maruti Suzuki said it sold 8% fewer units at 1,37,658 last month in the domestic market compared with a year earlier. Full-year local sales rose 3% to 13,65,370 units . “The shortage of electronic components had some impact on the production of vehicles in FY 2021-22,. the company said in a statement. “The company took all possible measures to minimise the impact. As the supply situation of electronic components continues to be unpredictable, it might have some impact on the production volume in FY 2022-23 as well,” it added. The company, however, exported 2,38,376 units in FY22 - the highest in any financial year. Hisashi Takeuchi, who took over as the MD and CEO on Friday said, “These export numbers are a reflection of India’s manufacturing potential and the acceptance of India-manufactured vehicles, all over the world.” Rohan Kanwar Gupta, VP and sector head - Corporate Ratings, ICRA, said that wholesale dispatches of passenger vehicles had risen over the past few months, aided by an improvement in semiconductor supplies. “In March 2022, domestic wholesale volumes at [about] 3.2 Lakh units represented [about] 6% growth on a sequential basis and only a marginal 0.4% decline on YoY basis,” Mr. Gupta said, adding that aided by improved production, retail sales had also improved over the recent past; in March 2022, retail sales at 3.2 lakh units represented only an about 6% decline on a YoY basis. “The ongoing crisis with regard to Russia and Ukraine could, however, impact semiconductor chip production, as Russia and Ukraine are both suppliers of raw materials used in semiconductor manufacturing, and remains a monitorable. The impact of the crisis in the form of higher fuel and commodity prices also poses a risk to demand prospects, in case it materialises into a long-drawn out war,” he added. Hyundai Motor India sold 44,600 units in the domestic market, while exporting 10,687 units in March 2022. For the full fiscal, the company posted a growth of 2% in domestic sales to 4,71,535 units. Homegrown Mahindra & Mahindra’s passenger vehicle wholesales grew 65% in March to 27,603 units, and 44% to 2,25,895 for the full fiscal. Automotive Division CEO Veejay Nakra said demand continued to be strong, even as the company remained ‘watchful of the global supply chain’. Tata Motors sold a total of 6,92,554 units in domestic market in the full fiscal, higher by 49% year-on-year, while recording 30% growth to 86,718 units in March. Shailesh Chandra, Managing Director, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd. and Tata Passenger Electric Mobility Ltd. said, “Tata Motors set several new records in a challenging year, disrupted by two waves of COVID, semiconductor crisis and steep increase in commodity prices. We posted the highest ever annual, quarterly and monthly sales, supported by a strong demand for our New Forever range and agile actions taken on the supply side.” He said the company recorded the highest ever annual passenger vehicle (PV) sales of 3,70,372 units, registering a growth of 67% over the previous fiscal. “Tata Motors’ commercial vehicle domestic sales in Q4 at 1,10,027 units was [about] 21% higher than the previous quarter and 12% higher than the same quarter last year (Q4 FY21)...Early signs of recovery were seen in otherwise worst impacted CV passenger segment...We are cautiously optimistic about domestic MHCV & ILCV demand while keeping a close watch on geopolitical developments, fuel inflation and semiconductor shortage.” Meanwhile, Honda Cars India said it recorded annual sales growth of 4.3% to 85,609 units in FY22. Domestic sales for March were lower at 6,589 units compared with 7,103 units a year earlier. Yuichi Murata, director, Marketing and Sales, said: “The last fiscal year has been a mixed bag for the industry. Every quarter was punctuated with multiple challenges - from the pandemic to paucity, hike in raw material pricing and chip shortage. The industry, however, showed resilience and succeeded in restoring positivity in the market."" He added, “We weren't isolated from these challenges and did feel the impact of the chip shortage. With the market situation returning to normalcy after an extended tough period, the current situation looks stable, paving way for growth in future. We are entering this financial year with renewed energy and enthusiasm.” Toyota Kirloskar Motor said it dispatched 17,131 units during March, its highest-ever domestic sales in a single month in the last five years. For the full year, the company registered 58% growth selling wholesales of 1,23,770 units Nissan Motor India too witnessed 100% y-o-y growth with wholesales of 37,678 units FY21, and 3,007 units in March 2022. Managing Director Rakesh Srivastava said: “FY21 for Nissan India has been a year of turnaround with volume growth of 100% in domestic in an industry growth of 13%, despite the headwind challenges of COVID-19 and semiconductor-related supply shortages. Skoda Auto India clocked its highest ever sales volume of 5,608 units in March. The previous high for the company was 4,923 cars sold in June 2012.

21,"April 01, 2022",19:34 IST,business,industry,Power consumption grew 4.6% in March as States eased curbs," India's power consumption grew 4.6% in March from a year earlier to 126.12 billion units (BU), signalling the impact of early onset of summers and easing of lockdown restrictions by States. Power consumption in March 2021 was 120.63 BU, higher than 98.95 BU seen in the same month of 2020, as per Power Ministry data. February too witnessed 4.6% growth in power consumption to 108.03 BU, the data showed. Peak power demand met, or the highest supply in a day, rose to 199.29 GW in the month under review, compared to 170.16 GW in March 2020 and 185.89 GW in March 2021. Experts are of the view that power consumption growth remained steady in March due to easing of local restrictions imposed by States to curb the spread of the deadly coronavirus coupled, with early onset of summers. Local restrictions had affected industrial and commercial demand, they said. The third wave of the pandemic hit the country in January, which forced many States to impose local restrictions such as night and weekend curfews. They had also taken measures such as banning dining in bars and restaurants. These restrictions were eased gradually by States. Experts opined that the power demand and consumption would show a robust growth in the coming months as the States have lifted almost all local restrictions after a decline in the positivity rate. Going ahead, power consumption would surge with increased industrial and commercial activities after the easing of lockdown restrictions and due to the longer spell of summers in the coming months, according to experts.  Power consumption grew 1.8% in January 2022 to 111.80 BU.  Growth rates were 3.3% and 2.5% in December and November 2021, respectively.

22,"April 01, 2022",03:37 IST,business,industry,Amazon workers in NYC vote to unionise in historic labor win," Amazon workers in Staten Island, New York, voted to unionise on Friday, marking the first successful U.S. organising effort in the retail giant’s history and handing an unexpected win to a nascent group that fueled the union drive.  Warehouse workers cast 2,654 votes — or about 55% — in favor of a union, giving the fledgling Amazon Labor Union enough support to pull off a victory. According to the National Labor Relations Board, which is overseeing the process, 2,131 workers — or 45% — rejected the union bid.  The 67 ballots that were challenged by either Amazon or the ALU were not enough to sway the outcome. Federal labor officials said the results of the count won’t be verified until they process any objections — due by April 8 — that both parties may file.  The victory was an uphill battle for the independent group, made up of former and current workers who lacked official backing from an established union and were out-gunned by the deep-pocketed retail giant. Despite obstacles, organisers believed their grassroots approach was more relatable to workers and could help them overcome where established unions have failed in the past. They were right.  Chris Smalls, a fired Amazon employee who has been leading the ALU in its fight on Staten Island, bounded out the NLRB building in Brooklyn on Friday with other union organizers, pumping their fists and jumping, chanting “ALU.” They uncorked a bottle of Champagne, and Smalls hailed the victory as a call to arms for other Amazon workers across the sprawling company. “I hope that everybody’s paying attention now because a lot of people doubted us,” he said. Mr. Smalls hopes the success in New York will embolden workers at other facilities to launch their own organizing campaigns. Even his group will soon shift their attention to a neighboring Amazon warehouse on Staten Island, where a separate union election is scheduled to be held in late April. Organizers believe Friday’s win is going to make it easier for them to win there, too. Amazon posted a statement on its company website Friday saying that it was evaluating its options following the election, and signaled it might not accept the results. “We’re disappointed with the outcome of the election in Staten Island because we believe having a direct relationship with the company is best for our employees,” the post said. “We’re evaluating our options, including filing objections based on the inappropriate and undue influence by the NLRB that we and others (including the National Retail Federation and U.S. Chamber of Commerce) witnessed in this election.” Amazon has long argued that workers don't need a union because the company already provides good wages as well as benefits such as health care, 401(k) plans and a prepaid college tuition program to help grow workers’ careers. The successful union effort on Staten Island stood in contrast to the one launched in Bessemer, Alabama by the more established Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. Workers at the warehouse there appear to have rejected a union bid but outstanding challenged ballots could change the outcome. The votes were 993-to-875 against the union. A hearing to review 416 challenged ballots is expected to begin in the next few days.  The union campaigns come at a time of widespread labor unrest at many corporations. Workers at more than 140 Starbucks locations around the country, for instance, have requested union elections and several of them have already been successful.  But Amazon has long been considered a top prize for the labor movement given the company's massive size and impact. “We are clearly in different moment after two years of the pandemic. Something has changed in the labor landscape,” said John Logan, director of labor and employment studies at San Francisco State University. “It is a potential tipping point. We knew that unions were having a moment, but this is much bigger. There is no bigger prize than organizing Amazon.” Mr. Logan said he didn’t believe either union — the national or the independent labor group — would stand a chance with Amazon but he’s even more shocked that a small union would be victorious given its limited resources. The group had also filed for a union election after getting support from about 30% of the facility’s workforce, a much lower percentage than what unions usually seek. Logan believes they won in part because Amazon workers saw the organisers as authentic. And it helped that they were in labor-friendly state, he said, adding the grassroots union’s win defies traditional thinking that only national unions can take on big companies. Alabama, by contrast, is a right-to-work state, which prohibits a company and a union from signing a contract that requires workers to pay dues to the union that represents them. But the ALU might still have a fight ahead of it, according to Erin Sutton, a sociology professor at the University of Buffalo in New York. “Getting Amazon to the bargaining table will be another feat all together,"" Mr. Sutton said. ""Oftentimes the union will fizzle out because the company doesn’t come to the bargaining table in good faith as they’re obliged to do. Amazon has pushed back hard in the lead-up to both elections in Staten Island and Bessemer. The retail giant held mandatory meetings, where workers were told unions are a bad idea. The company also launched an anti-union website targeting workers and placed English and Spanish posters across the Staten Island facility urging them to reject the union. In Bessemer, Amazon has made some changes to but still kept a controversial U.S. Postal Service mailbox that was key in the NLRB’s decision to invalidate last year’s vote. In a filing released on Thursday, Amazon disclosed it spent about $4.2 million last year on labor consultants, which organizers say the retailer routinely solicits to persuade workers not to unionise. It’s unclear how much it spent on such services in 2022. Both labor fights faced unique challenges. Alabama, for instance, is a right-to-work state that prohibits a company and a union from signing a contract that requires workers to pay dues to the union that represents them.  The union landscape in Alabama is also starkly different from New York. Last year, union members accounted for 22.2% of wage and salary workers in New York, ranked only behind Hawaii, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That’s more than double the national average of 10.3%. In Alabama, it’s 5.9%. The mostly Black workforce at the Amazon facility, which opened in 2020, mirrors the Bessemer population of more than 70% Black residents, according to the latest U.S. Census data.  Pro-union workers say they want better working conditions, longer breaks and higher wages. Regular full-time employees at the Bessemer facility earn at least $15.80 an hour, higher than the estimated $14.55 per hour on average in the city. That figure is based on an analysis of the U.S. Census Bureau’s annual median household income for Bessemer of $30,284, which could include more than one worker. The ALU said they don’t have a demographic breakdown of the warehouse workers on Staten Island and Amazon declined to provide the information to The Associated Press, citing the union vote. Internal records leaked to The New York Times from 2019 showed more than 60% of the hourly associates at the facility were Black or Latino, while most of managers were white or Asian.  Amazon workers there are seeking longer breaks, paid time off for injured employees and an hourly wage of $30, up from a minimum of just over $18 per hour offered by the company. The estimated average wage for the borough is $41 per hour, according to a similar U.S. Census Bureau analysis of Staten Island’s $85,381 median household income.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/amazon-workers-in-nyc-vote-to-unionise-in-historic-labor-win/article65282853.ece
23,"March 31, 2022",20:47 IST,business,industry,Auto component industry likely to clock 8-10% growth in FY23: report," The Indian auto component industry is expected to clock 8-10% growth in FY23, supported by the easing of supply-chain issues and commodity inflation in the second half of the year, according to rating agency Icra. For 2021-22, the revenue growth of the industry is pegged at 13-15%, driven by domestic OEM, replacement, export volumes and pass-through of commodity prices. The healthy volume growth will, however, come on a low base of FY2021, the agency said in a statement. ""Demand for auto components stems from domestic OEMs, replacement and exports. Domestic OEM demand has remained a mixed bag across segments in FY2022, with a slowdown in two-wheelers (2Ws) and semiconductor shortage dragging down overall production volumes,"" Icra Ltd. Assistant Vice President & Sector Head – Corporate Ratings Vinutaa S said. Exports have remained a bright spot in the Indian auto component story, partly aided by the ""China+1 strategy"". This is despite supply chain issues, she added. ""ICRA believes that the growth in FY2022 exports would have been even better if not for the semiconductor shortage. While auto ancillaries have a healthy export order book for the next few months, the impact of geopolitical and supply-chain issues on actual offtake remains monitorable,"" Ms. Vinutaa said. For FY2023, Icra said, ""Revenues are likely to expand by 8-10% supported by easing of supply-chain issues and commodity inflation in H2 FY2023. Over the long term, premiumisation of vehicles and focus on localisation will translate into healthy growth for auto component suppliers"". The rating agency said cost inflation and semiconductor shortage remain headwinds for the industry. ""Operating margins for auto ancillaries are likely to be impacted in the near term with elevated raw material, fuel and freight prices. While the semiconductor situation has been improving in the last 1-2 months, the Russia-Ukraine conflict could stress the globalised chip value chain,"" it said. In the aftermarket segment, the agency said the improvement in personal mobility, healthy freight movement and deferment of new vehicle purchases due to cost inflation have supported replacement sales in the last few months. Part of the revenue growth has also come from commodity pass-through. While January to mid-February was relatively dull because of the Omicron wave, demand has picked up in the last few weeks.

24,"March 31, 2022",19:24 IST,business,industry,Reliance defends takeover of Future stores in letter," India's top retailer, Reliance, has privately defended an abrupt takeover of the stores of debt-laden rival Future Retail, saying mounting dues of $634 million compelled it to act beyond expectations, a company letter shows. The takeover was part of the race to dominate a $900-billion retail sector that set off a bitter dispute in which India's Supreme Court will decide whether Reliance or Amazon.com Inc. gets to scoop up Future's assets. The March 8 letter, seen by Reuters, reveals for the first time Reliance's stance on the events of the night of February 25, when staff suddenly showed up at many of its rival's stores to take control over missed lease payments. That move stunned not only Future but also Amazon, which has cited violation of certain contracts to legally block, since 2020, a $3.4-billion deal between the two Indian giants. In the letter, Reliance said it went ""well and truly beyond what can be expected"" to keep Future ""out of harm's way,"" as it took ""significant steps"" to ensure business continuity at Future and make sure there was ""no impediment"" to their deal. These steps included financial support of ₹48 billion ($634 million), comprising ₹11 billion of unpaid lease rentals and ₹37 billion of working capital. Over months, Reliance had taken over the leases of more than 900 of Future's 1,500 stores, while still allowing the company to run them. As Future proved unable to pay outstanding dues and losses in its retail operations swelled, Reliance faced ""compelling circumstances"" and decided to exercise its legal right to take over the stores, the letter added. Neither Reliance nor Future immediately responded to a request for comment. Future, which is staring at bankruptcy as its losses grow, has previously called Reliance's move ""drastic and unilateral"". Before Amazon blocked it, Reliance, led by India's richest man, Mukesh Ambani, had proposed a $3.4-billion deal to buy Future's retail, wholesale and logistics operations, as well as some other businesses. But following Reliance's abrupt takeover of its stores, Future sought several assurances in a March 2 letter, also seen by Reuters, asking if Reliance would stick to the deal without changing its value or terms. In its response on March 8, Reliance said Future's request for assurances had to be seen ""in the light of the rapidly evolving circumstances"". It added, ""As and when the scheme (deal) is implemented, it will be in accordance with its terms.""",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/reliance-defends-takeover-of-future-stores-in-letter/article65278261.ece
25,"March 30, 2022",21:11 IST,business,industry,"In LS, Opposition terms ₹1,000 cr. package for tea industry jumla, Minister hits back","  The Lok Sabha on Wednesday witnessed sharp exchanges between the Opposition members and Minister of State for Commerce and Industry Anupriya Patel after Congress’s Gaurav Gogoi dubbed Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s promise of a ₹1000 crore package for the tea industry of Assam and West Bengal as a ‘jumla’ or a gimmick.   During the Question Hour, when Mr. Gogoi said that not a penny had been spent out of the amount that Ms. Sitharaman had announced in last year’s Budget, Ms. Patel said, “This is not at all ‘jumla’. There has been in-depth thinking and planning on the part of the government... We want to take all the benefits to the intended beneficiaries with due diligence and in a systematic manner”.  Though the Tea Board had drafted the Prime Minister Chai Shramik Protsahan scheme, there was an opinion that all welfare schemes related to education, health or other facilities were already being made available through various schemes of the ministries, she stated.  “One more opinion came that we can set up capital infrastructure like anganwadi centres, hospitals, ayush and wellness centres and schools,” she said.  One Rank One Pension (OROP), extension of the GST compensation and alleged misuse of Central agencies against political rivals were the other prominent issues that figured in during the Zero Hour.  Raising the OROP issue, Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the government had not done justice with retired armed force personnel as it opposed a plea by the ex-Servicemen association in the Supreme Court. With Congress president Sonia Gandhi by his side, Mr. Chowdhury said the previous Congress-led UPA government on February 17, 2014 had promised to implement OROP as per the recommendations of the Bhagat Singh Koshyari Committee. “The present government believes in encashing their valour for vote politics but when it comes to giving back, it forgets them”, he alleged.  In the Supreme Court recently, the government opposed the ex-Servicemen association that had sought implementation of OROP with an automatic annual revision (as recommended by the committee) instead of the current policy of periodic review once in five years. Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam member Kathir Anand raised the issue of Goods and Services Tax (GST) compensation for the States and demanded that the Centre extend it by a couple of years. Under the GST law, the States were guaranteed to be compensated bimonthly for any loss of revenue in the first five years of GST implementation from July 1, 2017. Tamil Nadu would suffer a revenue loss of about ₹20,000 crore if the compensation was not extended beyond five years, he said. Trinamool Congress’s Sougata Roy raised the issue of ‘using’ the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate against non-BJP ruled States, leading to sharp exchanges between the TMC members and the Treasury benches. As BJP members protested, Mr. Roy used a term that Speaker Om Birla asked him not to use and adjourned the House for lunch.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/in-ls-opposition-terms-1000-cr-package-for-tea-industry-jumla-minister-hits-back/article65274947.ece

During the current fiscal till early this week, the cumulative FPI outflows touched a record $14.6 billion, of which March alone saw them taking out as much as $5.4 billion, while February saw another record pullout to the tune of $4.7 billion, according to the analysis. The value of FPI holdings stood at $582 billion as of March 15, 2022 (down from $667 billion in September 2021 peak), of which, IT (15%, up 87 bps), energy (15.5%, up 44 bps), healthcare (4.9%, up 22 bps) saw higher allocation. On the other hand, allocation to financials was down 107 bps to 31.5%. Domestic funds' holdings stood at $265 billion as of February 2022, on the back of $13.1 billion fresh allocation. However, the FPI holding value is massively down from the record $667 billion in the first half of FY22, which was an addition of a full $112 billion between April 1 and September 30, 2021, according to an earlier BofA report. The value of the FPI holding was $555 billion as of March 2021, which was a full $105 billion more than the value between September 2020 and March 2021.  According to the report, the market is not bleeding badly because domestic institutional investors have been very active and have pumped in 13.1 billion in the year, of which $5 billion was in February alone, leaving the net outflow from the market only at $1.5 billion. BofA also pointed out that the $5.4 billion of FPI outflows in March marked the sixth consecutive month of outflows, taking the cumulative pullout to $14.6 billion on the back of heightened geopolitical risks. The March outflows were the most severe since March 2020 after the pandemic hit the world.  Since late March, after Russia invaded Ukraine, the market has been jittery. Outflows gathered further momentum with the U.S. Fed raising rates by 25 bps and stuck to its plans of six more rounds of rate hike this year. While the FPI ownership of domestic stocks peaked in December 2020 at 21.4%, which inched down to 21.2% in March 2021, by December 2021 it came down further to 19.9%, according to the report. In comparison, FII inflows to other EMs so far in 2022 saw heavy outflows while Brazil-led inflows of $11.7 billion. As of March 15, energy ($74 million and healthcare ($46 million) saw inflows, while there was negative deployments across other sectors like financials ($2.9 billion), industrials ($651 million), discretionary ($1.2 billion), accounting for the highest outflows since March 2017. Outflows in IT ($80 million) slowed down considerably after two consecutive months of heavy outflows ($1.8 billion average). Year 2021 saw the primary market on a song with saw record IPO fund raising of $16 billion and though volatility has slowed or delayed primary issuances, the 2022 pipeline remains strong at an estimated $13 billion, if LIC's $8 billion issue gets through.

Rajan, MD, IL&FS, disclosed at a press conference. The building, completed in the ’90s, is owned by group company TIFC. It will change hands during the course of 2022-23, he said. “For me, in many ways, IL&FS is symbolised by this outstanding construction which is among the first buildings in BKC,” said non-executive chairman Uday Kotak. “We, as a public interest board, did what is right for all the stakeholders and it is probably among the last major decisions taken during my tenure. It was a team job but there was sadness at the [signing] event. But we wanted to do what is right,” he added. He said there were many interested parties but most had issues with the structure of the building. Stating that it gone to the best buyer he said the property had been “sold at ₹29,000 per sq. ft, which is the prevailing rate in BKC.” For a while, IL&FS will utilise some space in this 4.5 lakh sq. ft building to help continue with the debt resolution process. On Tuesday, Uday Kotak announced that his term as non-executive chairman of IL&FS would end on April 2. The government had appointed him to lead the new board in October 2018.  Mr. Rajan, the current MD, has been appointed as chairman and managing director of IL&FS for a period of 6 months from April 3 by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. On lessons learnt in handling the IL&FS ‘fiasco’ in the last three and a half years, Mr. Kotak said, “Speed is important in [handing such] crises rather [than] wrangling that often happens amongst different policymakers.” “Six layers of governance failed to function [which led to this crisis]. These include the management of the company, the board, Institutional shareholders, rating agencies, auditors and regulators. From governance point of view, we had six layers and the challenge was the structure (of operations) of IL&FS, he said. “From the system’s point of view, irrespective of public or private sector, the nature of structure of groups and conglomerates, whether IL&FS or any other group, needs a close watch by the regulators and policymakers. So that you do not have a complex animal or hydra that goes out of control over time. I do hope that there is a significant watch on this as we go forward,” he added.  The new board which met on Monday estimated that the company had addressed debt of ₹55,000 crore till date, compared with ₹52,200 crore as of November 2021. The incremental resolution of more than ₹2,700 crore since November 2021 comprised ₹1,080 crore from the sale of the headquarters, ₹900 crore under the Khed Sinnar claim settlement with NHAI, ₹230 crore from settlement of IFIN’s non-performing loan accounts and ₹520 crore from other recoveries. In addition, the Group has been servicing debt of ₹1,000 crore across companies that have been named as green entities. The Group retained its overall resolution estimate at ₹61,000 crore, representing 62% of overall debt of more than ₹99,000 crore as of October 2018. “The debt addressed till date (₹55,000 crore) represents over 90% of the overall estimated resolution value. Resolution of remaining ₹6,000 crore debt will move into FY23,” Mr. Rajan said. “This overall resolution estimate of 62% is double the average recovery of 31% under IBC,” he added. “This has been largely possible due to the continued commitment of the new board and the management to preserve value in assets of national importance and maintaining going-concern status,” he added. Of the 347 entities under IL&FS Group as of October 2018, 246 stand resolved, leaving 101 entities to be resolved in the next financial year. An application has been filed with the NCLAT for undertaking interim distribution of ₹16,000 crore of cash and InvIT units available across the Group. More than 75% of the amount would be distributed to creditors of three large holding companies - IL&FS, IFIN and ITNL - which have a large base of public fund creditors. Mr. Kotak and Mr. Rajan emphasised that they had to encounter several challenges in completing the resolution, which in turn, impacted timelines. “Some of these are existence of complex shareholding arrangements and web of intra group borrowings, non-payment of dues by state utility to ITPCL, delay in receipt of annuities from some State Governments, securing various consent from other stakeholders including lenders, shareholders and joint venture partners, coercive creditor actions, and ongoing legal proceedings by different lender groups, sub-contractors and authorities,” Mr. Rajan said.",Special Correspondent ,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/ilfs-headquarters-at-bkc-sold-to-brookfield-for-1080-crore/article65271436.ece

""Over the last one year, developers’ average cost of construction has risen 10-12%, owing to a higher input cost due to supply-side constraints. The cost of key materials like cement and steel have risen over 20% yearly as of March 2022. These constitute a predominant share in the total cost of construction,"" Colliers said in a statement.  The consultant said that developers, so far, have been cautious about increasing prices as the market was recovering from the aftermath of COVID-19.  However, developers have now started feeling the pinch of rising cost and they have started reviewing their pricing strategy, it added.  ""With rising material cost, developers will be compelled to increase prices as construction materials account for about 2/3rd share in the total cost of construction.

Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) Secretary V. Raghunandan told PTI that the spectrum reference given to the regulator spanned multiple bands and thereby involved detailed and exhaustive deliberations. ""We are in the final stages and will come out with the recommendations shortly in 7-10 days,"" Raghunandan said. TRAI's views on spectrum pricing and other nuances are crucial as it will set the pace for the auctions and subsequent roll-out of the fifth-generation services that will usher in ultra-high-speed and spawn new-age services and business models. The telecom industry was expecting the regulator's recommendations to come by March-end. The telecom regulator, in November-end last year, had released a detailed consultation paper to discuss threadbare the modalities for auction of spectrum across multiple bands, including pricing, quantum and other conditions — preparing the groundwork for upcoming 5G auctions. TRAI's comprehensive consultation paper runs into 207 pages and throws up 74 questions for industry-wide discussion, touching on crucial aspects like valuation and reserve price of 5G spectrum, quantum of the spectrum, block size, eligibility conditions for participation in the auction, roll-out obligations, spectrum cap, and surrender of the spectrum. Norms will also be worked out for new frequencies such as 526-698 MHz and millimetre band that is 24.25 - 28.5 GHz, in addition to bands such as 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz, 2500 MHz, and 3300-3670 MHz. The last round of spectrum auctions, held in March 2021, had raked-in winning bids of over ₹77,800 crore for 855.6 MHz of spectrum. But, nearly 63% of the total spectrum remained unsold. As the country gears up for the mega auction, the industry players have been making an aggressive pitch for lowering spectrum pricing. Telecom operator Bharti Airtel's Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Randeep Sekhon had recently made an emphatic appeal for ""affordable"" pricing of 5G radiowaves, saying pricing ""will play a very important role"". ""If operators are made to buy very expensive spectrum, naturally their cash flows will be limited, they will have to pay. But if it is very reasonable, then it is very possible that the operator will bring the same money on increasing footprint faster,"" Mr. Sekhon had said last week.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/business/5g-spectrum-pricing-telecom-regulators-recommendations-in-7-10-days-work-in-final-stages-trai-secretary/article65270006.ece
34,"March 29, 2022",10:30 IST,business,industry,The Startup India initiative," Anish Tiwari, Colm O’Gorman and Teresa Hogan, ‘ The good, the bad, and the ugly of ‘Startup India’ —  a review of India’s entrepreneurship policy’ , Economic & Political Weekly (EPW), Vol (50), 2021.  A research paper from Dublin City University in Ireland, reviewing India’s entrepreneurial policy Startup India, affirmed its positive impact in reducing regional entrepreneurial disparities. However, it cited shortcomings in addressing the under-representation of women and marginalised caste groups in the national startup ecosystem. The paper was published in the Economic and Political Weekly in December 2021. Startup India was introduced in 2016 as a “clarion call to innovators, entrepreneurs, and thinkers of the nation to lead from the front in driving India’s sustainable growth and create large scale employment opportunities.”  Minister for Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal informed the Lok Sabha the other week that the entrepreneurial portal had more than 65,000 startups registered. Of which, 40 attained the ‘unicorn’ status in the last twelve months, bringing the total as of date to 90. He stated that India ranked third among global startup eco-systems.  The evidence collated by authors of the research paper suggested that the networking, training and mentoring facilities provided by Startup India alongside entrepreneurship outreach campaigns in tier-2 and tier-3 cities, helped address regional entrepreneurial disparities in India. The program was aimed at scouting entrepreneurs from these cities and integrate them into the portal. It would then facilitate a network between venture capital funds, angel networks, banks, incubators, accelerators, universities, legal partners, consultants and research & development institutions.  The paper states the initiative helped redirect many State govts’ policymaking in favour of startups. Quoting from Startup India’s Report (2018), the researchers mention, only four States had dedicated startup policies prior to its launch. After its launch and as of December 2019, 23 States and 2 Union Territories had formulated a dedicated startup policy.  Despite the initiative, the researchers pointed out that entrepreneurship continued to be “highly concentrated” in three megacities, namely, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Delhi NCR. The three cities accounted for 93% of all funding raised between 2014 and 2019. The paper pointed out that India’s venture capital industry is also clustered in and around these three cities.  The same notion was established by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its Pilot Survey on the Indian Startup Sector (2019). The research involving 1,246 participants stated nearly three-fourths of the participants were from Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, Delhi and Tamil Nadu.  Quoting from recent studies, the researchers stated that such concentration can lead to increased economic inequality and hinder emergence of entrepreneurs from industries other than those belonging to the clusters. The spurt of industries (in this case, startups) create employment opportunities, this furthers a demand for leisure and essential amenities among the populace. In turn, this furthers employment, economic activity and efficiency. However, this takes place at the expense of another area having previously failed to enable a suitable supportive ecosystem.  According to results computed by the researchers in the paper, 30% of all States and Union Territories in India have an equal or higher proportionate share in the Dept for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade’s (DPIIT) recognised start-up pool in relation to their share in the country population.  The researchers point out that the 40-page Startup India Action Plan document has no mention of the words ‘caste’, ‘tribe’, ‘marginalised’, ‘indigenous’ or ‘social group’.  According to them, this contradicts the initiative’s very notion of making entrepreneurship in India inclusive. The under-representation could be due to multiple factors, the paper states, such as caste-based economic exclusion, the urban and rural divide, lack of access to quality education and limited social networks. Additionally, the policy’s reliance on technology does not take into consideration India’s digital divide, especially with respect to urban and rural areas.  With reference to government data from 2013, the paper concluded that SC and ST share in ownership of agricultural establishments including farming, livestock, fishery and forestry were higher in comparison to non-agricultural establishments. They were based majorly in rural areas in comparison to urban areas. Most of them operated without any hired workers, indicating that a significant number of these enterprises were necessity-based undertakings not creating any significant job opportunities. According to economist Thorsten Beck, necessity-based or subsistence entrepreneurship refer to businesses that are run informally and through self-employment. A large number of these are set up owing to lack of employment opportunities in the formal sector. “The evidence thus suggests the need for targeted measures to promote technology-and innovation-driven entrepreneurship among SC and ST communities. However, the Startup India policy document in its present form does not address this issue,” the paper noted.  In February, the Minister of State for Commerce & Industry Som Prakash, in response to a question on women entrepreneurship under Startup India, had informed that of 62,000 startups registered with the DPIIT, 46% of them had at least one woman director. RBI’s pilot survey had earlier stated that 5.9% of participating startups in its survey had a female founder in comparison to 55.5% of the opposite gender. The remaining 38.6% had both male and female co-founders.  Mr Som had also apprised the house of dedicated measures taken to spurt women entrepreneurship. 10% of the fund in the Fund of Funds operated by Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) has been reserved for women-led startups. Further, all the Alternate Investment Funds where the SIDBI takes equity have been mandated to contribute 20% in business which are women led, women influenced and women employment or women consumption centric. He also informed the house about capacity building programmes and the dedicated webpage for women on the portal. As per the established arrangement, the DPIIT allocates funds to SIDBI, which in turn invests the money in alternative investment firms (AIFs). The latter would then raise matching funds, and post fundraising, invest the money and disburse to startups, the paper informs. This is done to avoid any potential accusation of ‘favouritism’.

And India is allowed to import from UAE up to 120 tonnes of gold at 1% duty less than the applicable duty in the first year. The volume will increase to 200 tonnes in five years. GJEPC Chairman Colin Shah said, “The Indo-UAE CEPA will strengthen business ties with one of the biggest buyers of Indian jewellery.” Stating that it would transform India’s economic relations with the entire Gulf region and beyond, he said the move would also reinvigorate Indian plain gold and studded jewellery exports to UAE which accounted for 26% of gem & jewellery exports.  “With 0% import duty on jewellery, we are expecting jewellery exports to UAE will move to new heights of US$ 10 billion annually,” Mr. Shah said. The strategic pact with UAE would pave the way for raw material import at competitive price into India and provide free access for finished products to UAE market, he added. The partnership would also enable Indian independent and chain-store retailers to export jewellery directly to UAE-based consumers. “This will be a game changer for our industry. The CEPA will fast-track India’s goal of reaching $50 billion in exports of gems and jewellery by 2022-23,” he added. Indian gem and jewellery exports to UAE suffered due to the COVID-19 pandemic and plunged to US$ 2.7 billion in 2020-2021.  However, for the period of April 2021 -February 2022, gem & jewellery exports to UAE have recovered to US$ 5.1 billion but is down as compared to US$ 9.26 billion in April 2019- February 2020. “CEPA will give a fresh lease of life to bilateral trade relations and solidify existing ties,” the GJEPC chief said.",Special Correspondent,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/agreement-will-propel-indias-jewellery-exports-to-uae-to-over-10-billion-annually-says-council/article65266789.ece
37,"March 27, 2022",22:04 IST,business,industry,Think Investor: Rebalancing goal-based investments," You should set up systematic investment plans (SIPs) on your equity and bond investments to achieve your life goals. Your SIPs for equity investments could be in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or mutual funds, and your SIPs for bond investments could be in bank recurring deposits. After setting up an SIP, you may have to annually rebalance your portfolio. In this article, we discuss why rebalancing is important to achieve your life goal. We also discuss how to rebalance your portfolio. Annual adjustment Asset allocation refers to the proportion of equity and bond investments you decide to have in your portfolio to achieve a goal. This is a function of four factors — the time horizon for a life goal, the amount you want to accumulate to achieve the goal, the amount you can save to achieve this goal, and the expected post-return return assumed on equity and bond investments. Suppose the time horizon for a life goal is 10 years and you want to accumulate one crore to achieve the goal. Also, suppose you can save ₹50,000 per month. You must earn a compounded annual return of 9.5% to accumulate the desired amount in 10 years. Assume the expected post-tax return on equity is 11% (pre-tax 12% with 10% capital gains tax) and on recurring deposit is 3.5% (pre-tax 5% with 30% income tax). Then, your asset allocation must be 80% equity and 20% bonds to achieve this goal. Now, because your equity investments can carry unrealised gains (losses) every year, the asset allocation at the end of the year could be different from 80/20. You must adjust the proportion of equity to bring the asset allocation back to 80/20. This adjustment process is called as rebalancing. Rebalancing rule What if equity investments go up after you sell some units of your ETF or mutual fund? Or what if equity investments go down after you decided not to rebalance? Either way, you are exposing yourself to regret. Following a simple rule for rebalancing will moderate such regret. Now, the post-tax (and pre-tax) return on equity and bonds are on a compounded annual basis as 9.5% required return is on a compounded basis. That means you must leave 12% of unrealised gains every year in your equity investment to accumulate the desired amount at the end of the time horizon for a goal. It also means you can take out gains greater than 12% per annum by selling appropriate number of units in the fund. This will reduce the risk of losing the excess returns if the market declines later. You can keep such excess returns in a fixed deposit and use this amount to reinvest in equity in years when actual return is lower than 12%; for such shortfall can compounded over the years leading to a larger shortfall at the end of the time horizon for the life goal.  To simplify this process, you can open a savings-cum-deposit account (flexi deposit) in a bank where you operate a savings account to manage all your investments. You will incur capital gains tax when you to sell ETF or mutual fund units for rebalancing purposes. To defer capital gains tax, you can decide to rebalance only if the actual return is greater than 13% in any year, leaving a margin of one percentage point over the expected return. Note that rebalancing is the first of the two processes required to manage your equity investments through the time horizon for a life goal. The second process involves typically reducing equity allocation during the last five years of the time horizon for a life goal. That could be the subject of a later discussion.

39,"March 27, 2022",00:40 IST,business,industry,Explained | How significant is the attainment of India’s $400 billion exports target?," The story so far: On March 21, the value of India’s outbound shipments in the financial year 2021-22 hit $400 billion, the highest ever. By the time the year closes this Thursday, another $10 billion worth of goods is expected to be shipped out. This would translate into a growth of about 41% from the pandemic-hit year of 2020-21, making it India’s fastest exports growth rate since 2009-10.  First, 2021-22 reflects the first time in several years that the country has met its exports target, but for greater context, India’s trend line in exports before the COVID-19 disruptions was nowhere close to this year’s performance. According to data from the Reserve Bank of India, outbound merchandise trade had clocked $303.5 billion in 2017-18, $330.1 billion in 2018-19 before slipping to $313.4 billion in 2019-20, when numbers were slightly dented due to the harsh national lockdowns imposed in the last week of that financial year. While higher prices of commodities and oil helped drive up the value of exports, with petroleum products exports jumping over 141%, some of India’s industrial sectors shone through as well. Engineering exports, for instance, have jumped 46.5% to cross $100 billion for the first time, even as chemicals, cotton yarn, handloom products, and the apparel industry have done well. India has managed to achieve its export target despite supply disruptions due to the pandemic, the challenging shortages of shipping containers and surging freight rates. Part of this could also be explained by the world shifting its global procurement preferences to diversify their dependence on China following the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus. Australia, which is in the midst of a shrill trade battle with China, has made way for India, taking exports up 94% so far this year. Shipments to the U.S. are also up 47%. India would hope to consolidate these gains and establish its credentials as a credible alternative to China, even as it could face stiff competition in some sectors from Asian peers such as Vietnam and Bangladesh.  Even as exports may rise nearly $120 billion this year, India’s imports have shot up to record levels and could end up nearly $200 billion over 2020-21’s import figure of $393.6 billion. The trade deficit for the year could be around $190 billion, sharply higher than the $102 billion recorded in the pandemic year. The monthly trade deficit has been spiking recently and had hit a record $22.9 billion in November 2021, with imports gaining greater momentum than exports.  Although India’s direct trade with Russia is not significant at about 1% of its trade basket, the Ukraine-Russia conflict may create some more opportunities for Indian farm produce exports, especially for crops like wheat and maize. But this would be offset by a sharp rise in India’s energy import bill as well as an uptick in costs of importing edible oils like sunflower oil, whose production is dominated by the two nations at war. India imports 80% of its oil and demand is likely to grow as the economic recovery picks up pace, provided the pandemic doesn’t resurface. This could translate into a ’term-of-trade’ shock, with elevated trade and current account deficits and sustained pressure on the rupee even as monetary tightening in the developed world may suck out dollars from emerging markets. The RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das has pointed out that unlike the taper tantrum of 2013, the country’s foreign exchange reserves, adequate to cover more than 12 months of imports, are robust and can finance higher current account deficits if needed. Most economists, however, expect the rupee to weaken over 2022-23, which in turn could be a minor perk for exporters.  While high shipping rates, container shortages and re-alignment of trade routes around the Black Sea will pose a challenge, timely actions on the policy front could help create more export opportunities. First, a swift conclusion of Free Trade Agreement pacts being negotiated with countries like the U.K., Australia and Canada, could create easier market access in these large markets. Second, exporters await a long-overdue revision of the Foreign Trade Policy for 2015-20, that has now been extended into the first few months of 2022-23 as well. Third, a parliamentary committee has urged the government to include Special Economic Zones and sectors such as pharma, steel, and chemicals under the Remission of Duties and Taxes on Export Products (RoDTEP) Scheme, which finally kicked off last year after a significant delay. These could help balance out some of the bigger tectonic shifts in trading patterns from the European crisis, including a firming up of the COVID-induced inward-looking shift in nations’ stance on globalisation.

41,"March 25, 2022",21:03 IST,business,industry,Supertech Ltd. declared bankrupt; NCLT orders insolvency proceedings in ₹432-crore default case,"  Real estate developer Supertech on Friday was declared bankrupt by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), a move that could have a bearing on 25,000 home buyers of the firm's ongoing projects in the Delhi and NCR region.  Acting on a petition filed by the Union Bank of India for non-payment of about ₹432 crore worth dues, the bankruptcy court ordered the initiation of insolvency proceedings against real estate firm Supertech Ltd., one of the companies of Supertech group. The NCLT said ""there has been a default in payment of the financial debt"" and appointed Hitesh Goyal as the Interim Resolution Professional (IRP) superseding the board of Supertech Ltd.  A two-member NCLT bench comprising P. S. N. Prasad and Rahul Bhatnagar said the documents submitted by the financial creditor Union Bank of India as well as the corporate debtor Supertech had ""substantiated"" the former's claim that there was a debt on which the builder had defaulted.  ""In light of the above discussion, after giving careful consideration to the entire matter, hearing arguments of the parties and upon the appreciation of the documents placed on record to substantiate the claim, this tribunal admits this petition and initiates CIRP on the corporate debtor with immediate effect,” the NCLT said.  CIRP refers to Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP).  Supertech Ltd. has 38,041 customers and out of them, homes have been delivered to 27,111 people. As many as 10,930 homes are yet to be delivered and among them, over 70% construction is complete with respect to over 8,000 homes, according to Supertech Group Managing Director Mohit Arora. The tribunal has also directed the IRP to make a public announcement in this regard and declared a moratorium against the company as per the provision of the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code. Moratorium will continue till a resolution plan is approved and during that period no new cases or claims can be filed against the company in any court of law, tribunal, arbitration panel or any other authority.  Apart from this, Supertech is also barred from transferring, encumbering, alienating, or disposing of any assets.  This is the second major setback for Noida-based developers in the last one year.  On August 31 last year, the Supreme Court had ordered the demolition of Supertech Ltd.'s twin 40-storeyed towers, which are part of the under-construction Emerald Court project in Noida for violation of building norms. Supertech Group said it would challenge the order before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT).  ""In the matter of appointment of IRP in one of the Supertech Group companies by the NCLT, management of the company stated that the company will be approaching NCLAT in an appeal against the order,"" Supertech Group said in a statement.  However, it also added the NCLT order will not affect operations of other companies of the Supertech Group.  The NCLT order will not impact the construction at all ongoing projects or operation of the company and ""we are committed to giving delivery of units to allottees,"" it said.  When contacted, Mr. Arora said, ""there are around 11-12 housing projects in the Supertech Ltd. against which insolvency proceedings have been initiated. Around 90% of these projects are completed."" The debt of Supertech Ltd is about ₹1,200 crore, including nearly ₹150 crore loans from Union Bank of India, he added.  According to Mr. Arora, there are three-four other companies in the group that are developing many projects across Delhi-NCR, including luxury project Supernova.  The default pertains to the loan given by Union Bank of India to Eco Village II project at Greate Noida (West) in Uttar Pradesh, which was being developed at a cost of ₹1,106.45 crore.  In 2013, Supertech Ltd. had approached various financial institutions to avail a credit facility of ₹350 crore from a consortium of banks, and out of them, Union Bank of India, the lead bank, had an exposure of ₹150 crore.  A loan agreement was executed between the banks and Supertech on December 30, 2013.  Later, loan account of banks which was maintained by Supertech in respect of credit line became highly irregular with repeated defaults in payment of principal and interest.  Finally, a notice was sent on April 24, 2019 and Supertech again failed to pay and Union Bank of India moved the NCLT.  Supertech had opposed the plea contending that it was filed by the lenders with the authority and as per the clauses of their inter credit agreement, lenders are restricted to initiate any action of winding up, liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency or dissolution of the borrower.  Moreover, NPA classification of their account was contrary to the guidelines issued by RBI, as per the realty firm contended.  Rejecting the argument, the NCLT said Suptech had submitted a one time settlement proposal which was not accepted by the financial creditor.  ""The counsel for the corporate debtor has therefore admitted the debt and default,"" it said.

Air travel in South Asia is expected to grow at 6.9% annually through 2040 and the projected traffic growth means the region’s fleet will nearly quadruple by the same period. The Outlook has been made anticipating resilient long-term demand for commercial airplanes and services following the COVID-19 pandemic, Boeing said in a release. “We project robust demand for air travel in South Asia with carriers increasing services and passengers feeling confident about travel... as well as from air cargo,” Mr. Schulte said. Factors that will promote continued growth in the region will be the competitive domestic market and opportunities in international routes, both backed by government policies to reduce airline cost and taxes, he said. The Outlook estimated India’s air cargo growth to an average 6.3% annually, driven by the country’s manufacturing and e-commerce sectors, including the Make in India initiative. Boeing forecasts demand for more than 75 freighters, including 10 widebodies and 737 Boeing Converted Freighters. India’s civil aviation industry will require close to 1 lakh new pilots, technicians and cabin crew personnel, the company said in the release. “India continues to develop as one of the world’s largest civil aviation markets, as it ramps up its capabilities and capacity in infrastructure and services,” Boeing India president Salil Gupte said in the release.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/boeing-forecasts-indias-new-aircraft-demand-to-be-over-2200-in-2-decades/article65259937.ece

Replying to a supplementary question during Question Hour, Mr. Chauhan said four companies had been allotted spectrum for conducting trials which were expected to be completed soon. In parallel, the Minister said, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) had been asked to give its recommendations on the upcoming auction.  ""We will conduct auctions very soon. By the end of this year, we will start 5G services in the country,"" he said.  He asserted that the state-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) would begin its 4G services this year.  The Minister said a ""great revolution"" had taken place in the telecom sector over the last seven years and that data consumption had soared while tariffs were at the lowest.  There was a robust public grievance mechanism in place and complaints pending for over 48 hours were escalated to senior officials, Mr. Chauhan said.  The government had taken a slew of measures to revive telecom PSUs BSNL and MTNL. The quality of BSNL services would also improve with the launch of the state-owned corporation's 4G services, he asserted.  Mr. Chauhan also outlined the reforms undertaken by the government in the telecom sector and cited measures such as re-definition of AGR (Adjusted Gross Revenue).  In a written reply, Communication Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said, ""There is no decline in the number of mobile subscribers in the country in the year 2020-21."" As per the monthly Telecom Subscription Data released by the TRAI, the number of mobile subscribers in India increased from 1,157.75 million in March 2020 to 1,180.96 million in March 2021.  To improve the Quality of Service (QoS), he said drive test and Radio Frequency (RF) optimisation were carried out regularly by mobile service providers.  ""Further, to provide state-of-the-art and prompt service to mobile customers, service providers optimally manage the increasing traffic by way of adding more number of sites, providing fibre backhaul, using small cells and undertaking network optimisation,"" Mr. Vaishnaw said.  Moreover, the TRAI had issued guidelines and set various parameters and benchmarks to monitor QoS.  These parameters were assessed for the entire licence service area on a quarterly basis.  For ensuring compliance with the QoS benchmarks and to protect the interests of consumers, the TRAI had prescribed the system of financial disincentives for non-compliance with the benchmarks, Mr. Vaishnaw said.

45,"March 25, 2022",20:15 IST,business,industry,India said to restrict sugar exports to 8 million tonnes,"  India plans to restrict sugar exports for the first time in six years to prevent a surge in
domestic prices and could cap this season's exports at 8 million
tonnes, government and industry sources told Reuters. An announcement could come early next month, they said. Shares in sugar manufacturers slid on the news, with Dhampur
Sugar Mills and Balrampur Chini each tumbling 5% and Dwarikesh Sugar losing 6%. ""Sugar output is going to be a record high, but stocks are
depleting fast because of exports. Uncontrolled exports could
create scarcity and local prices could spike during festive
season,"" said a senior government official with knowledge of the
matter who asked not to be identified. Two of three sources said the government has planned a cap
of 8 million while one official said the government is also
exploring the option of a levy on exports to discourage overseas
sales. India's Ministry of Commerce and Industry did not
immediately respond to a request for comment. A cap of 8 million tonnes for the marketing year to
end-September could result in a de facto ban for exports from
May as dealers say mills have already contracted to export 7
million tonnes so far. Based on March deals for about 1 million tonnes of exports,
they estimate mills could sign contracts for another 1 million
tonnes in April after global white sugar prices
jumped to a 5-year high on Thursday. Lower output in top producer Brazil and firm oil prices
which encourage mills to produce more sugarcane-based ethanol
have spurred global price gains. Export curbs by India, the
world's No. 2 sugar exporter, would likely further lift prices. Earlier projections estimated domestic sugar stocks as of
October 1 could fall to a five-year low of 6.8 million tonnes due
to record exports, but those forecasts now look optimistic after
the rise in global sugar prices. ""New Delhi is keen to start the new season with opening
stock of 6 to 7 million tonnes, which is enough to fulfill
December quarter demand,"" an industry official said. Demand usually jumps during the December quarter due to
weddings and festivals such as Diwali and Dussehra. Any sugar exports curbs would the first since India imposed
a 20% tax in 2016 and would represent an about-face for a
government which until last year was providing subsidies for
mills that were struggling to make cane payments to farmers due
to record stockpiles. But bumper exports of more than 14 million tonnes over two
years now mean that New Delhi's priorities have switched to
producing enough sugar to meet local demand. ""Government policy is clear. Produce enough sugar to fulfill
local demand and make as much ethanol as possible from remaining
surplus sugar cane. Don't rely on exports as global prices are
volatile,"" said a policymaker who declined to be identified. The government is also naturally concerned about food
inflation as prices of essential commodities such as edible oils
and grains are rising in the wake of Russia's invasion of
Ukraine, said a Mumbai-based dealer with a global trading firm. In the past, the government was embarrassed to import sugar
at higher prices after exporting record quantities, the dealer
said but added he didn't think the government would be reticent
about imports now if it really needed to.",Reuters,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/india-to-restrict-sugar-exports-cap-of-8-mln-tonnes-one-option-sources/article65259941.ece

for gas imports in euros instead of dollars, two sources said, in a sign the Russian energy giant seeks to wean itself away from the U.S. currency in the wake of the Ukraine conflict. European countries and the United States have imposed heavy
sanctions on Russia since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine on
February 24. GAIL has a long-term gas import deal with Gazprom Marketing
& Trading Singapore to annually buy 2.5 million tonnes of
liquefied natural gas and has been settling trade with Gazprom
in dollars. GAIL, which imports and distributes gas, also operates
India's largest gas pipeline network. Last week, Gazprom wrote to GAIL requesting that the company
settle payments for gas purchases in euros instead of dollars,
the sources familiar with the matter said, adding the state-run
Indian firm is still examining the request. ""GAIL doesn't see any problem in settling payment in euros
as European countries are paying for their imports in euros,""
said one of the sources. The sources said that sanctions might not hit payments in
euros because GAIL's contract is with a Singapore unit of
Gazprom. Gazprom and GAIL did not respond to Reuters' emails seeking
comment. Western sanctions have dealt a crippling blow to Russia's
economy, but the European Union, which relies on Russian oil and
gas, has stopped short of placing curbs on energy imports and
continues to pay in euros. President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Russia, the
world's largest gas producer, will soon require ""unfriendly""
countries to pay for fuel in roubles. India, however, has refrained from outright condemnation of
Russia, although it has called for an end to violence in
Ukraine, and it has not banned Russian oil and gas imports,
unlike several Western countries. In fact, Indian companies are snapping up Russian oil as it
is available at a deep discount after some companies and
countries shunned purchases from Moscow. The sources said that so far Gazprom is supplying the
volumes committed to under its contract with GAIL. The sources declined to be named as they are not authorised

47,"March 25, 2022",19:36 IST,business,industry,"Sinopec said to pause Russia projects, Beijing wary of sanctions"," China's state-run Sinopec Group has suspended talks for a major petrochemical investment and a gas marketing venture in Russia, sources told Reuters, heeding a government call for caution as sanctions mount over the invasion of Ukraine. The move by Asia's biggest oil refiner to hit the brakes on a potentially half-billion-dollar investment in a gas chemical plant and a venture to market Russian gas in China highlights the risks, even to Russia's most important diplomatic partner, of unexpectedly heavy Western-led sanctions. Beijing has repeatedly voiced opposition to the sanctions, insisting it will maintain normal economic and trade exchanges with Russia, and has refused to condemn Moscow's actions in Ukraine or call them an invasion. But behind the scenes, the government is wary of Chinese companies running afoul of sanctions - it is pressing companies to tread carefully with investments in Russia, its second-largest oil supplier and third-largest gas provider. Since Russia invaded a month ago, China's three state energy giants - Sinopec, China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC) and China National Offshore Oil Corp. (CNOOC) - have been assessing the impact of the sanctions on their multibillion dollar investments in Russia, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. ""Companies will rigidly follow Beijing's foreign policy in this crisis,"" said an executive at a state oil company. ""There's no room whatsoever for companies to take any initiatives in terms of new investment."" The Ministry of Foreign Affairs this month summoned officials from the three energy companies to review their business ties with Russian partners and local operations, two sources with knowledge of the meeting said. One said the ministry urged them not to make any rash moves buying Russian assets. The companies have set up task forces on Russia-related matters and are working on contingency plans for business disruptions and in case of secondary sanctions, sources said. The sources asked not to be named, given the sensitivity of the matter. Sinopec and the other companies declined to comment. The ministry said there is no need for China to report to other parties about ""whether there are internal meetings or not"". ""China is a big, independent country. We have the right to carry out normal economic and trade cooperation in various fields with other countries across the world,"" it said in a faxed statement. U.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday that China knows its economic future is tied to the West, after warning Chinese leader Xi Jinping that Beijing could regret siding with Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Global oil majors Shell and BP, and Norway's Equinor pledged to exit their Russian operations shortly after Russia's Feb. 24 invasion. Moscow says its ""special operation"" aims not to occupy territory but to destroy Ukraine's military capabilities and capture what it calls dangerous nationalists. Sinopec, formally China Petroleum and Chemical Corp, has
suspended the discussions to invest up to $500 million in the
new gas chemical plant in Russia, one of the sources said. The plan has been to team up with Sibur, Russia's largest
petrochemical producer, for a project similar to the $10 billion
Amur Gas Chemical Complex in East Siberia, 40% owned by Sinopec
and 60% by Sibur, set to come online in 2024. ""The companies wanted to replicate the Amur venture by
building another one and were in the middle of site selection,""
said the source. Sinopec hit pause after realising that Sibur minority
shareholder and board member Gennady Timchenko had been
sanctioned by the West, the source said. The European Union and
Britain last month imposed sanctions on Timchenko, a long-time
ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and other billionaires
with ties to Putin. Mr. Timchenko's spokesman declined to comment on sanctions. The Amur project itself faces funding snags, said two of the
sources, as sanctions threaten to choke financing from key
lenders, including Russia's state-controlled Sberbank
and European credit agencies. ""It's an existing investment. Sinopec is trying to overcome
the difficulties in financing,"" said a Beijing-based industry
executive with direct knowledge of the matter. Sibur did not comment on the suspension of the talks for the
new chemical plant but said it continues to cooperate with
Sinopec. It said the two companies continue to work jointly on
implementing the Amur plant. ""Sinopec is actively participating in the issues of the
project's construction management, including equipment supplies,
work with suppliers and contractors. We are also jointly working
on the issues of project financing,"" Sibur told Reuters by
email. Sinopec also suspended talks over the gas marketing venture
with Russian gas producer Novatek over concerns that
Sberbank, one of Novatek's shareholders, is on the latest U.S.
sanctions list, said one source with direct knowledge of the
matter. Mr. Timchenko resigned from Novatek's board on Monday in the
wake of the sanctions. Novatek declined to comment. Novatek, Russia's largest independent gas producer, entered
a preliminary deal in 2019 with Sinopec and Gazprombank to
create a joint venture marketing liquefied natural gas to China
as well as distributing natural gas in China. Beyond Sinopec's planned Amur plant, CNPC and CNOOC were
among the latest investors into Russia's natural gas sector,

Countering criticism IiAS, Mr. Bhargava noted that all models produced at Suzuki Motor Gujarat (SMG), including electric vehicles (EVs), would be ultimately sold by Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) in the marketplace. IiAS has raised serious questions regarding the decision of the Suzuki Motor Corporation (SMC) to invest directly in the EV project instead of MSI doing it. ""This proxy firm had also come out against the establishment of the Suzuki Motor plant in Gujarat. The shareholders overwhelmingly rejected the advice of the proxy firm. The voting was overwhelmingly in favour of this project. What has happened now is just within that project only, there has been no new agreement,"" Mr. Bhargava told PTI. He said the deal had already been approved by shareholders and there was nothing new to be opposed to. ""It is already a done deal, this is not a new thing. I don't know why they (IiAS) are opposing it. The cars made in Gujarat will be supplied to Maruti at a cost, we will sell the car, that is the arrangement approved in 2014, so what is new here,"" he noted. On MSI's plans on introducing an EV by 2025, Mr. Bhargava said: ""They (SMG) will manufacture it in Gujarat and sell it by 2025"". He further said: ""There are so many models SMG is manufacturing. They have a production capacity of 7.5 lakh units. So this (EV) is part of that"". When asked if the EV model would also be part of the same arrangement with SMG, Mr. Bhargava stated: ""Yes.. nothing was said that the car that would be manufactured there (SMG) would only be with internal combustion ones... Any car which is manufactured there will be sold by us"". SMG, a 100% subsidiary of SMC, supplies cars exclusively to MSI. On March 20, SMC announced it would invest about 150 billion yen (about ₹10,445 crore) by 2026, for local manufacturing of battery electric vehicles (BEV) and batteries in Gujarat. The company has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to this effect with the Gujarat government. Under the MoU, SMG will invest ₹7,300 crore for the construction of a plant for BEV batteries on land neighbouring SMG's existing plant, by 2026. IiAS (Institutional Investor Advisory Services) has noted in its report that the larger issue continues to be this inherent conflict of interest – between owning a 100% subsidiary and having a listed company in the same market. ""These structures make it easier for MNCs to hollow out the listed subsidiary and reduce its value. Maruti’s shareholders must constructively engage with SMC to understand how this structure will work. Asking the right questions now will hopefully allow their concerns to be built into the project design,"" it stated. For Maruti, its future may be at stake, the advisory firm noted while adding that the company must define its role in the EV venture. A consultation with its stakeholders – as at the time of setting up the Gujarat plant, will enable Maruti to create a mutually beneficial deal structure and remain relevant, it noted. ""Will Maruti’s shareholders benefit from SMC’s decision to enter the EV space in India? This is a question that Maruti’s shareholders must ask SMC,"" it noted in its report. IiAS had also rallied against the decision by SMC to set up a wholly-owned subsidiary in Gujarat on land that was allocated to Maruti. ""This issue plays up once again. SMG will invest in setting up the EV plant. SMC will argue that this saves Maruti’s shareholders the capital, but Maruti had Rs 30 billion in liquid cash and little debt on its balance sheet on September 30, 2021 – investing Rs 104.45 bn over the project years is unlikely to stress Maruti’s financial profile,"" it noted.",PTI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/marutis-bhargava-brushes-aside-concerns-on-ev-project-says-plans-dont-go-against-interests-of-shareholder/article65256352.ece

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation's (ONGC) aging Mumbai High, Neelam and Heera fields off the Mumbai coast have been on a decline and water is injected into wells to push out the remaining oil.  ""There was inadequate water injection,"" the CAG said in a report tabled in Parliament on Thursday.  ""Water injection in the field was affected due to aging of injection infrastructure, frequent pipeline leakages due to poor quality of injection water, non-implementation of feasibility report inputs and to some extent, production from high gas-oil ratio wells."" This led to a drop in reservoir pressure sharply and impacted crude oil production.  ""Deficient water injection impacted loss of production of crude worth ₹7,802.50 crore for ONGC and revenue loss of ₹3,474.29 crore to the Government of India by way of statutory levies during the audit period (2014-15 to 2018-19),"" it said.  CAG said this loss cannot be considered as deferred production but a permanent loss of oil.  ""Further, even for exploitation of a part of this oil deficit, additional investment is required and this needs review from the point of economical oil recovery,"" it said.  Mumbai High, Neelam and Heera fields contribute about 59% of ONGC's production. The mature fields, which have been operating from 1976 and 1984 respectively, are susceptible to decline in production.  CAG said the shortfall in water injection is one of the significant reasons for less production of crude oil.  The crude that could not be produced due to lesser water injection was 3.79 million tonnes during the audit period.  ""The value of oil deficit of 3.79 million tonnes due to less water injection worked out to ₹11,276.79 crore. Out of this, the value of the oil deficit was ₹7,802.50 crore for ONGC after considering the statutory levies and the balance ₹3,474.29 crore is revenue loss to the Government of India,"" it said.  CAG said there was a continuous decline in reservoir pressure due to inadequate water injection since the inception of fields which impacted crude oil productivity and its ultimate recovery.  ""Decline in reservoir pressure is further accentuated by higher gas production from the reservoir,"" it said. ""Periodic recommendations of the (Oil) Ministry on importance of water injection, its distribution and maintenance of reservoir health were not fully implemented.""

Oil companies ""will need to raise diesel prices by ₹13.1-24.9 per litre and ₹10.6-22.3 a litre on [petrol] at an underlying crude price of $100-120 per barrel,"" according to Kotak Institutional Equities. CRISIL Research said a ₹9-12 per litre increase in retail will be required for a full pass-through of an average $100 per barrel crude oil and ₹15-20 a litre if the average crude oil price rises to $110-120. Moody's estimated that IOC's revenue loss was about $1-1.1 billion while that of BPCL and HPCL was about $550-650 million each for the period between November and March. ""This loss in revenue will add to the short term borrowings, funded with working capital lines, of the refiners until such time that crude oil prices stay at elevated levels. ""Over time, the companies might be able to make up for some of these losses if oil prices come down,"" it added. While fuel prices in India are deregulated and refiners can pass on cost increases to the consumer, a steep price hike such as the one required under the current oil price environment will be in coordination with the government and may involve a reduction in excise duties. ""We do expect that the government will allow refiners to adjust prices appropriately and avoid a situation where refiners continue to make losses of this magnitude for a prolonged period,"" it said. Moody’s added that the two days’ of price increases underpin the expectation that the increases would be gradual and occur over a period of time rather than being a one-time adjustment. ""Until such time refining and marketing companies can cover the increase in feedstock costs either by an increase in selling prices or a reduction in excise duties or both, they will have to continue to absorb a proportion of the increased feedstock costs which will hurt their profitability and increase borrowings,"" it said. A sustained increase in crude oil prices will also result in inventory valuation gains for the refiners, which will partially mitigate the impact of lower selling prices. Higher crude oil prices will also result in increased working capital requirements, resulting in incremental borrowings for the refiners. Poorer earnings combined with higher borrowings will weaken the credit metrics of the downstream companies, the rating agency said. ""A sharp rise in crude oil prices, combined with the refiners' inability to increase retail selling prices of transportation fuels in India for over four months (between November 4, 2021, and March 21, 2022) due to recently concluded elections in five Indian states, will hurt the profitability of state-owned refining and marketing companies IOC, BPCL and HPCL,"" it said.  High oil prices, however, will have a mixed impact on the sector.  While upstream oil and gas producers such as ONGC and OIL will benefit from higher earnings, downstream companies like IOC, BPCL and HPCL will be negatively impacted because of higher feedstock costs and increased working capital requirements.",PTI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/ioc-bpcl-hpcl-lost-225-bn-due-to-fuel-price-freeze-moodys/article65255955.ece

In a bid to encourage private sector participation in the space sector, New Space India Limited (NSIL), a company under the Department of Space, had invited proposals from the Indian industry to build five PSLVs. Minister of State in the PMO Jitendra Singh said two consortia, one comprising Hindustan Aeronautics Limited and Larsen & Toubro, and another involving Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), Adani Enterprises Limited (AEL) and Bharat Earth Movers Limited (BEML), have submitted techno-commercial proposals for building PSLV. State-run Bharat Heavy Electrical Limited too has submitted a techno-commercial proposal for “end-to-end realisation” of PSLV, he told the Rajya Sabha in response to a question by NCP member Vandana Chavan. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) had been working closely with the industry in building launch vehicles, satellites and other components, but it was for the first time in 2020 that the Government ope ned up the sector for private participation for the entire spectrum of space operations, including planetary exploration missions. The Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) acts as the agency to promote, handhold and authorise private sector activities in the sector, besides enabling sharing of technical facilities and expertise from ISRO. NSIL has the mandate to scale up private participation in the space programme and also own and operate capital-intensive assets such as satellites and launch vehicles. Mr. Singh told the Rajya Sabha that since 2020, there have been 48 applications from private players received to IN-SPACe for undertaking space activities and their applications are being processed for further action. “Out of these, the applications with respect to authorising the space activities to non-Government private entities are 16, sharing of technology and facilities of Department of Space to NGPEs are 23 and Consultancy and Promotion are 9,” he said in a written response.",PTI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/adani-lt-among-firms-keen-to-build-satellite-launchers-govt/article65255319.ece

Denying the information, SEBI responded to RTI activist Subhash Agrawal that the information sought by him pertains to its internal functioning, and disclosure of which may hamper decision making in its supervisory and regulatory role. Using the Right to Information (RTI) Act, Mr. Agrawal had sought from the SEBI copies of its complete inspection reports in respect to the National Stock Exchange (NSE) from 2013 till date. He told PTI over email, “It was mentioned in the RTI application that the Supreme Court of India considered inspection reports prepared by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in respect of banks (private or public sector) under the RTI Act.” “With RBI being the regulatory body in respect of banks, SEBI being regulatory public authority in respect of the NSE is bound to provide inspection reports in respect of the NSE under provisions of the RTI Act. I had also requested for web-link, if any, having such information, and file-notings on movement of this RTI application,” Mr. Agrawal said. Taking cover under Section 8(1)(d) of the RTI Act, SEBI said information sought includes commercial confidential information of other entities, the disclosure of which could harm its competitive position. “In view of the above, the information sought is exempt under section 8(1) (d) of the RTI Act, 2005. However, information about any enforcement action taken by SEBI, is available in the public domain on the SEBI’s website: www.sebi.gov.in under the head ‘Enforcement’,” it said. SEBI on February 11 had charged the NSE’s former chief executive officer (CEO) and managing director (MD) Chitra Ramkrishna and others with alleged governance lapses in the appointment of Anand Subramanian as the chief strategic advisor and his re-designation as group operating officer and advisor to the MD. Ms. Ramkrishna had told the regulator that a formless mysterious “Yogi” was guiding her over emails in taking the decisions. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) which expanded its probe in the co-location scam, after the SEBI report surfaced, has arrested both of them and told the court that the ‘Yogi’ is understood to be Mr. Subramanian who was alleged beneficiary of her decisions. The agency, meanwhile, is focusing on retrieving email exchanges between Ms. Ramkrishna and rigyajursama@outlook.com. Ms. Ramkrishna, who succeeded former CEO Ravi Narain in 2013, had appointed Mr. Subramanian as her advisor who was later elevated as group operating officer (GOO) at a fat pay cheque of ₹4.21 crore annually.

Special Judge Sanjeev Aggarwal passed the order after hearing counsels for the CBI and Mr. Subramanian, who is presently in judicial custody. The former GOO was arrested by the CBI on February 24 and was remanded to custodial interrogation. He was sent to 14-day judicial custody on March 9. The CBI counsel said Mr. Subramanian, who impersonated as the “Himalayan Yogi” to influence NSE’s former MD and CEO Chitra Ramkrishna and remained evasive during interrogation, was a flight risk and should not be granted bail. Mr. Subramanian’s lawyer had sought his release on bail on the ground that he was not named in the FIR, he had no role in the NSE co-location facility while specifically denying the allegation that he was the “Himalayan Yogi” who allegedly influenced Ms. Ramkrishna’s decision making. On March 9, the court had pulled up the CBI for the tardy investigation in the case, saying that the magnitude of the case “will be big” and the reputation of the country was at stake. FIR in the NSE co-location scam was registered in 2018 for the alleged commission of offences under sections 204 (destruction of document or electronic evidence) and 120B (conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code as well as the violation of the provisions of the Information Technology Act and Prevention of Corruption Act. In the co-location facility offered by the NSE, brokers could place their servers within the stock exchange premises giving them faster access to the markets. It is alleged by the investigating agency that some brokers in connivance with insiders abused the algorithm and the co-location facility to make windfall profits. The CBI has also arrested Ms. Ramkrishna in the case.

Since its introduction in March 2020, the PLI scheme has been announced for 15 sectors, involving government incentives to the tune of ₹1.93 lakh crore. Of this, 50-60% is to be spent on sectors with domestic manufacturing and export focus, and the rest on import localisation. ""Implementation of the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme will lead to a potential capital expenditure (capex) of ₹2.5-3 lakh crore over the scheme period and will account for 13-15% of average annual investment spending in key industrial sectors over the next 3-4 years,” the rating agency said in a report released on Wednesday. PLI is now poised for a rapid on-the-ground execution, with almost 60% of the capex already approved and major spending set to occur over FY23-FY26. The capex has been approved for 10 sectors, it said. While the capex in mobile, pharma and telecom sectors has already kicked off, that in capital-intensive sectors such as automobile and solar photovoltaics — which form 70% of the committed investment — will kick off from April 2022, the agency said. The scheme has received interest from more than 900 players across sectors, of which about 350 have got approval so far. Crisil Director Hetal Gandhi said PLI would spur green investments in India, with around 55% of the scheme expected to be green, in sectors such as electric vehicles/fuel cell electric vehicles, and solar photovoltaics. The report said that along with supply-chain integration, PLI will aid exports too. Of the 15 sectors, nine have export potential ranging from 20$ to 80% of the incremental revenue generated, the agency said, adding that this, in turn, could create an annual export potential of ₹2 lakh crore or 6% of the total exports of calendar year 2021.

Ms. Sud said the Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) schemes under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) have helped immensely to move towards the goal of “Housing for All.”  “The residential real-estate segment will continue to see strong traction going forward as the demand for housing is not just pent-up demand but it is a structural one,” she said. Emphasising that the demand for housing continues to be from first-time homeowners as well as those moving up the property ladder – generally into larger homes, she said healthy demand has been seen across metros and non-metros for both affordable as well as high-end markets.  “The sweet spot for housing is still in the price range of ₹50 lakh to ₹ 1 crore,” she said. Affordable housing will continue to be the driving force behind the real estate sector in India, HDFC said.

Singh said in a written reply to the Rajya Sabha. According to the reply, this overdue amount does not include the disputed amount. The outstanding amount of the discoms (power distribution companies) becomes overdue after 45 days of raising the bill for supply of power by gencos. The Minister explained that the government has made several interventions to improve financial and operational efficiencies of discoms linked to reform measures, including Liquidity Infusion Scheme (LIS); additional borrowing of 0.5% of GSDP to states linked to power sector reforms; introducing additional prudential norms for lending by Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and REC based on the performance of utilities; and Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS). Further, the government had also issued an order dated June 28, 2019, enforcing opening and maintaining of adequate Letter of Credit (LC) as payment security mechanism under power purchase agreement (PPA) by distribution licensees. The order mandates NLDC (National Load Dispatch Centre) and RLDC (regional load dispatch centres) to dispatch power only after it is intimated by GENCO and discom confirming the opening of LC. These reform measures will improve the financial health of discoms, which will improve the liquidity situation leading to a reduction in outstanding dues to power generating companies (GENCOS), Mr. Singh stated. The Minister also informed the House that as per projections of the Central Electricity Authority, the share of coal-based thermal power generation capacity in the year 2030 would be about 32% in the energy mix as against the present share of 52%. In another reply, Mr. Singh said that 36.79 crore LED bulbs were distributed till March 16, 2022, which resulted in energy saving of 47,784 million units of electricity per annum, peak demand reduction of 9,566 MW and 38.70 million tonnes of CO2 emission reduction annually. The EESL has installed over 1.23 crore (as of March 16, 2022) LED street lights in ULBs (urban local bodies) and gram panchayats across India, which has resulted in energy saving of 8,516.7 million units of electricity per annum, peak demand reduction of 1,419.45 MW and 5.87 million tonnes of CO2 emission reduction annually, he added.",PTI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/discoms-owed-1-lakh-cr-to-power-generating-firms-till-feb-power-minister/article65249467.ece

75,"March 20, 2022",22:31 IST,business,industry,Nominating a vehicle to preferred beneficiary is key," Are you and your cousin both eyeing your grandfather’s vintage car? Up the ante smartly by charming your grandfather into nominating it to you, his favourite grandchild! At a more everyday level, we can now nominate our vehicles to our preferred beneficiary and, just like a financial investment, have it recorded on the Registration Certificate (RC) of the vehicle itself.  This new facility introduced in May 2021 makes the transfer of a motor vehicle on death of the owner simple and smooth.  Earlier formalities such as obtaining a legal-heirship certificate from the relevant government department and no-objection certificates from other legal heirs can be a thing of the past once nomination is done.  Nomination can be done when you buy a vehicle and get it registered, or anytime later. And, of course, you can change the nomination when you wish.  What is more, you can do it online on vahan.parivahan.gov.in authenticated by an OTP to the mobile number that is registered to your vehicle’s RC. In either method, at the time of nomination, the nominee’s identity proof should be furnished which will help with verification in the future. Neither the nomination nor any change in nomination requires the concurrence of the nominee. With this procedure signed and sealed, your nominee can get the vehicle transferred to their name and also the insurance policy, which they can then keep renewed. We see many people driving around in the family vehicle for years, still in the name of a deceased person, not aware of their laws they are breaking and the financial risks they are running. When it comes to that, they won’t be able to sell it easily either. Coming to insurance, if a person has an accident while driving the car still in the name of his deceased father, say, the insurance company can deny liability simply because the owner is deceased, the insurance is still in his name, and the current user has no title over the vehicle or insurable interest over the vehicle in order to maintain an insurance policy.  If the accident causes damage to the vehicle, that is a simpler problem. Pay up and get it repaired.   However, third-party liability involving property damage, injury or death can be very serious. This is because, without insurance to protect us against these liabilities, the work and cost of legal representation and the financial burden of the compensation becomes personal legal responsibilities. If your papers had been in order, your insurance company would have stepped in and protected you and you could have gone on with life as usual.  Here is an uncomfortable reminder: TP liability compensation awards by courts in the case of death runs into lakhs and crores of rupees and there is no easy way for an individual to bear it or wriggle out of it. Apart from ownership nomination, we have to ensure that the vehicle insurance itself is properly nominated. This will become operative in case there is a pending claim at the time of death of the owner, or in the case of compensation for the death of the owner himself. Nomination can be done at the inception of the policy as part of the proposal form, or later by way of an endorsement passed by the insurer.  Coming back to using vehicles without ownership transfer, there will be a score of issues with the regional transport office (RTO) as well. Road transport rules require that information about death of a vehicle owner should be communicated to it within 30 days and transfer of title initiated within three months, whether through nomination or legal heirship certificate. For three months after informing the RTO, the nominee/ legal heir has the right to use the vehicle as if they are the owner, by which time the transfer has to be ensured. A side note of caution: when you sell a vehicle too, please ensure the buyer transfers the title and insurance to their name, or you will still be called upon as the actual owner of the vehicle and be held legally responsible for all the hits and misses involving the vehicle.  There are precautions you can take to ensure the buyer does not fail to effect the transfer and we have seen this in earlier instalments of Cover Note. As a senior insurance colleague of mine points out, “vehicle owners generally do not understand the gravity of the motor vehicle plying without mandatory TP insurance. I have seen situations where even when the gravity is understood, the legalities make people take risk. This, in my opinion, is absolute madness.” I can’t agree more.

76,"March 20, 2022",22:26 IST,business,industry,Applying thought to your home loan," For many home loan borrowers, EMIs, or equated monthly instalments, constitute their single largest expense item. In many cases, the burden of home loan EMIs adversely impacts the investible surplus for meeting long-term financial goals. Here are a few tips for home loan borrowers to help secure their major financial goals even as they continue repaying their home loans: Home loan borrowers should first devise a financial plan based on their cash flow, risk appetite and investment horizons. This will help them fulfil various financial goals and implement their asset-allocation strategies. Borrowers should first estimate the amount required for fulfilling crucial financial goals after assuming a certain inflation rate. Then, take the help of online SIP calculators to calculate the monthly contributions required for achieving each of the financial goals after assuming the rate of returns and investment horizon. Invest in equity mutual funds for financial goals maturing after five years. The returns generated by the equity funds generally tend to easily beat inflation and other asset classes by a wide margin over the long term. The feature of automatic unit purchases in SIPs on pre-specified dates ensures financial discipline and regular investment. This can help you benefit from the power of compounding, and also ensure the averaging of investment cost during market corrections or bear market phases. Invest in fixed deposits, debt funds or other fixed-income instruments for financial goals maturing within five years to ensure income certainty and capital protection. Do not utilise your existing investments for making higher down payment or for prepaying the loan. Home loan borrowers are required to make down payment or margin contribution of at least 10% of the property’s cost for a loan amount of up to ₹30 lakh, at least 20% of the property’s cost for a loan amount between ₹30 lakh and ₹75 lakh, and at least 25% of the property’s cost for a loan amount more than ₹75 lakh. Making higher down payments would reduce the loan amount and thereby, the overall interest cost for the borrowers. Similarly, prepaying a home loan also helps in reducing the total interest cost. Having said that, avoid liquidating your existing investments for prepaying the loan or for making higher down payments, as doing so could lead you to avail of costlier loans in future. An emergency fund helps meet unavoidable or unforeseen expenses during a period of financial distress caused by illness or unemployment.  Without an adequate emergency fund, one would be forced to liquidate their existing investments and/or default on loan repayments. Home loan borrowers should ideally include their obligations towards the EMI payable on loans when they consider an adequate emergency fund.  This will safeguard them from defaulting on home loan repayments during financial emergencies. It will also save them from any adverse impact on their credit scores and their future loan eligibility. An emergency fund should be big enough to meet living expenses and unavoidable expenses such as rent, insurance premium, children’s tuition fee, EMIs and the like for at least six months. Borrowers can opt for home loan overdraft facility while availing of home loans. This facility allows borrowers to deposit their surplus funds in the overdraft account, opened in the form of a savings or current account, and linked to the home loan account. Borrowers can deposit their surpluses in the overdraft account and withdraw from it, as and when required.  The interest component of the home loan account is calculated after deducting the balance in the overdraft account from the outstanding loan amount. This helps in reducing their overall interest cost, without compromising on their liquidity.

The tax collections were ₹5 lakh crore more than the Budget estimates for 2021-22, and even surpassed the revised estimates by ₹1.87 lakh crore, with direct taxes shooting up 49% and indirect taxes climbing by 20%.  “When we started the year, the Budgeted estimate was ₹22.17 lakh crore, 17% higher than the previous year,” Mr. Bajaj said. “We are now close to ₹27.07 lakh crore, an increase of almost ₹5 lakh crore. These figures are tentative at the moment and they are likely to change and I hope that is on the upside, not the downside,” he added.  Corporation tax collections rose by 56.1% and personal income tax grew about 43%, vaulting overall direct tax growth to 49%, which the Revenue Secretary said was the ‘highest in a long time’.  “The Customs duty collections went up by 48%, as reflected in our robust export-import data, while excise duty collections have actually contracted 0.2% and the Central GST, which was a challenge for us, has grown by almost 30%,” Mr. Bajaj said.  “Commentators have said India’s tax-to-GDP ratio is very low. It was 10.3% in 2020-21 and has gone up to 11.7%, the highest since at least 1999. Direct taxes are 6.1% of GDP, and indirect taxes are 5.6%. So the criticism we faced last year, that our indirect taxes are higher than direct taxes, has also been” addressed, he emphasised.  The Finance Ministry, in a statement, said the tax-GDP ratio was the ‘highest’ and the tax buoyancy ratio was ‘very healthy’ at 1.9. The tax buoyancy ratio, which measures growth in taxes relative to GDP growth, was 2.8 for direct taxes and 1.1 for indirect taxes in 2021-22. The ratio of direct to indirect taxes recovered from 0.9 in 2020-21 to 1.1 in 2021-22. “This revenue growth has been propelled by rapid economic recovery after successive waves of COVID, supported by one of the largest immunisation programmes of the world run by the Government,” the finance ministry said, adding that the revenues signalled a ‘robust recovery’ and were supplemented by better compliance efforts.   ICRA chief economist Aditi Nayar said a large portion of the upside in revenues was shared with the States. “The actual tax devolution to the State governments in 2021-22 stood at ₹8.8 lakh crore, a considerable ₹1.4 lakh crore higher than the revised estimates (RE).

85,"April 08, 2022",10:40 IST,business,economy,The fineprint on the new tax on Employees’ Provident Fund income," The story so far: In the Union Budget of 2021-22, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman introduced a new provision to tax income on provident fund contributions from employees beyond ₹2.5 lakh a year. An Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) account is mandatory for formal sector workers earning up to ₹15,000 a month in firms with over 20 employees, as a means of ensuring retirement income. An amount equivalent to 12% of the basic pay and dearness allowance paid to a worker is deducted as employees’ contribution to their accounts, with an equivalent amount remitted by the employer. The EPF members are also allowed to voluntarily deploy more of their savings into the EPF account, an option many choose due to the need to build a larger nest egg for their sunset years and the reasonably healthy tax-free annual returns on the EPF.  The Finance Ministry had rationalised the tax move by arguing that the ₹2.5 lakh cap on contributions will cover about 93% of EPF members, and the tax-free, assured income was being milked by the super-rich and high net-worth individuals. Many were contributing crores into their EPF accounts and earning several lakhs as annual income, thus misusing what is essentially a social security scheme, the Revenue Department pointed out. While the tax provision also covers government employees, the contribution limit for tax-free income for them and any other PF accounts where employers do not contribute was set at ₹5 lakh per year. On August 31, 2021, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) notified rules to calculate the taxable income on PF contributions exceeding the specified limits, starting from the financial year 2021-22. The rules require all PF accounts to be split into separate accounts — one with the taxable contribution and interest earned on that component, and another with the non-taxable contribution that shall include the closing balance of the PF account as on March 31, 2021 and all fresh non-taxable contributions and interest thereon. The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), in charge of managing most private sector employees’ retirement savings as well as regulating the operations of a few thousand companies that manage their PF trusts in-house, issued a circular on Wednesday to explain the operational details of the tax.  The 43-page communique, which some tax experts noted is unusually long, seeks to provide guidelines on how to compute the tax liability in different scenarios. “The circular is mostly for administrative purposes and explains how withholding taxes would be computed and deducted in various situations such as withdrawal of funds from the PF account during the year,” said Suresh Surana, RSM India founder, adding that it lays down norms for the tax to be deducted at source by the EPFO or company-run PF trusts.  As specified by the CBDT, the EPFO will maintain a non-taxable account for contributions up to ₹2.5 lakh a year, and a taxable account for members who contribute over that threshold. Tax will be levied at 20% on such income for EPF members whose retirement savings accounts have not been linked to their Permanent Account Number (PAN), while the rate will be 10% for those who have linked their tax and EPF accounts. “Thus, PF members should ascertain that their PF accounts are linked with PAN in order to avoid unnecessary blockage of funds by way of deduction of TDS at a higher rate,” Mr. Surana advised.  The TDS rate has been pegged at 30% for non-resident employees with active EPF accounts in India, unless their countries of origin have a Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) with India. According to Mr. Surana, this rate would be further increased by education cess and applicable surcharges.  While the EPFO or an employer will take care of the TDS levies, if your income tax slab rate is higher than the rate at which the TDS was undertaken, you will need to pay the differential rate at the time of filing your IT returns, pointed out Deloitte India partner Saraswathi Kasturirangan. Moreover, depending on how much you contribute beyond the ₹2.5 lakh limit and whether your EPF and PAN are linked, there is some trickier math for you to work out. “Section 194A of the IT Act provides TDS deduction at 10% on eligible PF interest, provided the interest payable in the entire year is ₹5,000 or more. Thus, no TDS would be deducted if the PF interest paid to the resident does not exceed ₹5,000,” said Mr. Surana. Where the tax liability on PF contributions’ income is ₹5,000 or less, the tax will have to be calculated by the employee at the time of filing their returns. For instance, an interest income of ₹50,000 or ₹25,000 from contributions over ₹2.5 lakh, attracting a levy of 10% or 20%, respectively, would fall within this ₹5,000 cap. This may cover a lot of EPF members voluntarily parking more than mandated savings. “Employees will certainly need to keep close tabs on this and include such income in their returns,” Ms. Kasturirangan emphasised. This provision of the Income Tax Act, however, does not apply on non-residents, pointed out Mr. Surana, noting that the TDS in such cases would have to be deducted on the entire PF income chargeable to tax.

87,"April 06, 2022",14:46 IST,business,economy,ADB pegs 2022-23 GDP growth at 7.5%," The Asian Development Bank (ADB) forecasts India’s GDP growth to moderate to 7.5% in 2022-23 from an estimated 8.9% in 2021-22, but will pick up to reach 8% in 2023-2024.  The ADB has factored in the Russia-Ukraine conflict’s implications for India, which will be largely indirect through higher oil prices, and has assumed that the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic will subside with a rise in vaccination rates.  Although oil prices will exert upward pressure on the inflation front, the impact on inflation would be moderated by fuel subsidies and oil refineries stocking up on cheap crude from the Russian Federation, the ADB noted, predicting an average inflation rate of 5.8% in 2022-23, and 5% in 2023-24. There would still be an upward pressure on consumer prices with oil prices expected to average over $100 a barrel through 2022.  In its Asian Development Outlook report released on Wednesday the bank stated that food prices were expected to rise in tandem with increasing commodity prices  Higher public capital spending was expected to improve the efficiency of India’s logistics infrastructure, crowd-in private investment, generate jobs in construction and sustain growth, the bank said, emphasising that economic activity this year would hinge on catalytic effects of public investment.  The ADB expects capacity utilisation rates in Indian industry to improve over the first half of 2022-23, creating room for fresh investments, as private consumption could pick up amid the ebbing pandemic severity and mobility restrictions. “Inflation will accelerate and the current account deficit widen due to the surge in global oil prices,” it said, identifying the mobilisation of domestic resources as a key challenge at ‘all levels of government’ as India’s tax to GDP ratio of about 17% has been largely unchanged since the early 1990s.   Mobilising resources was particularly challenging for the State governments and improving their fiscal resources was critical for India’s sustained and inclusive growth, , the report said. “This is especially important because of rising State fiscal deficits since 2011-12 and higher ratios of State debt to GDP ratios since 2015-16. Worsening State finances have macroeconomic implications, especially on general government finances,” the report pointed out. India’s general government debt, a third of which was accounted for by the States, touched nearly 90% of the GDP in 2020-21 and was expected to stay high in the medium term.   Stressing that the States were constrained in ‘how much and from where they can borrow’, the ADB highlighted that the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax had also reduced their autonomy to raise revenues from sales taxes.  “The economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has further affected the revenue of the States and put a higher burden on them for financing pandemic-related expenditure. As a result, their budget deficits in 2020-21 and 2021-22 surpassed the mandated 3% of State GDP limit, with the deficit going as high as 7%”, it said.  “Elevated public debt levels add stress to public finances, making it even more important to ensure that new debt is used to finance investments with adequate returns. Higher debt pushes up interest rates, crowds out private investment, and results in a low-growth and a less sustainable debt path,” the bank warned, mooting the implementation of the 15th Finance Commission’s recommendations  to put the States’ finances on a sounder footing.

88,"April 06, 2022",12:50 IST,business,economy,"Services rebound in March, as per S&P Global PMI"," India’s services sector recorded the strongest growth since December 2021, as per the S&P Global India Services Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), which rose from 51.8 in February to 53.6 in March. A score of 50 on the PMI indicates no change in business activity.  On a quarterly basis, however, January-March 2022 recorded the weakest period for services players in 2021-22, with an average reading of 52.3, falling significantly from the 57.4 reading in the previous quarter.  Input costs increased at the sharpest pace in 11 years in March 2022, as operating expenses were driven up by higher chemical, fuel, raw material, retail, transportation and vegetable prices.  The Services PMI also signals a further decline in service sector jobs during March, though the rate of contraction slowed down. While some services firms passed on a part of the higher input costs, consumers are likely to face soaring prices in the coming months as cost burdens rise. Greater consumer footfall due to the relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions boosted contact-intensive services, but domestic sales drove most of the growth in services as new export orders fell further. The contraction in new export orders was sharp and the fastest since last September, and Inflation risks continued to curb business optimism regarding growth prospects going forward. For the first time in seven months, input price inflation was more acute in the service economy than in the manufacturing industry. Across the private sector, cost burdens rose at the sharpest pace in almost a decade, S&P Global said. “The war in Ukraine exacerbated lingering issues in supply chains, triggering a reacceleration in inflation across the Indian service economy. The March results showed the sharpest upturn in input costs for 11 years, but this did not put a brake on the recovery of the sector,” said the firm’s economics associate director Pollyanna De Lima.  While consumers were eager to go out and spend as pandemic restrictions were eased. Ms. De Lima noted that inflation risks continued to curb business optimism regarding growth prospects, with sentiment among services companies remaining subdued by historical standards. “This lack of confidence in the outlook also meant that employment continued to fall in March,” she emphasised. Within services, finance and insurance had the best month in sales and output, while real estate and business services were the weakest link, recording sharper declines in new orders and activity.   Consumer services recorded the strongest increase in input costs, while transport, information and communication registered the sharpest rate of charge inflation, S&P Global said in a note about the PMI survey, which is based on responses from 400 firms. Taking the services and manufacturing sectors together, aggregate output growth hit a three-month high, with the S&P Global India Composite PMI Output Index inching up from 53.5 in February to 54.3 in March.

89,"April 05, 2022",09:40 IST,business,economy,World Bank projects war shocks to drag on Asian economies,"  Disruptions to supplies of commodities, financial strains and higher prices are among the impacts of the war in Ukraine that will slow economies in Asia in coming months, the World Bank says in a report released Tuesday. The report forecasts slower growth and rising poverty in the Asia-Pacific region this year as “multiple shocks” compound troubles for people and for businesses. Growth for the region is estimated at 5%, down from the original forecast of 5.4%. The “low case” scenario foresees growth dipping to 4%, it said. The region saw a rebound to 7.2% growth in 2021 after many economies experienced downturns with the onset of the pandemic. The World Bank anticipates that China, the region’s largest economy, will expand at a 5% annual pace, much slower than the 8.1% growth of 2021. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has helped drive up prices for oil, gas and other commodities, eating into household purchasing power and burdening businesses and governments that already are contending with unusually high levels of debt due to the pandemic, the report said. The development lending institution urged governments to lift restrictions on trade and services to take advantage of more opportunities for trade and to end fossil fuel subsidies to encourage adoption of more green energy technologies. “The succession of shocks means that the growing economic pain of the people will have to face the shrinking financial capacity of their governments,” said the World Bank’s East Asia and Pacific Chief Economist Aaditya Mattoo. “A combination of fiscal, financial and trade reforms could mitigate risks, revive growth and reduce poverty.” The report pointed to three main potential shocks for the region: the war, changing monetary policy in the U.S. and some other countries and a slowdown in China. While rising interest rates make sense for cooling the U.S. economy and curbing inflation, much of Asia lags behind in its recovery from the pandemic. Countries like Malaysia may suffer outflows of currency and other financial repercussions from those changing policies, it said. Meanwhile, China’s already slowing economy could falter as outbreaks of COVID-19 provoke lockdowns like the one now in place in Shanghai, the country’s biggest megacity. That is likely to affect many Asian countries whose trade relies on demand from China. “These shocks are likely to magnify existing post-COVID difficulties,” the report said. The 8 million households whose members fell back into poverty during the pandemic, “will see real incomes shrink even further as prices soar.” The report noted that regional economies fared better during the 2021 Delta variant waves of coronavirus than in the initial months of the pandemic in 2020, largely because fewer restrictions were imposed and widespread vaccinations helped limit the severity of the outbreaks. On average, countries with a 1 percentage point higher vaccination rate had higher growth, it said.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/world-bank-projects-war-shocks-to-drag-on-asian-economies/article65292046.ece

92,"April 03, 2022",22:59 IST,business,economy,Where to invest in times of inflation," Wherever we look, the signals are clear that prices are rising. Most of the conversations among the middle-class and upper-middle-class families are about rising prices denting their budgets. Most people are finding it challenging to balance their budget.  The wholesale price index has been in double digits during the last several months, and the CPI has been hovering around 6%. This is true not only in India but even in the developed world. U.S. inflation is now running at more than 7%, and the response of the central banks has been relatively tepid. In the face of the highest inflation in 40 years, the Federal Reserve has increased short term interest rates by only 0.25%. This seems to have had no impact on inflationary pressures or expectations of inflation one year down. At the same time, a bloody war has broken out in mainland Europe with Russia invading Ukraine. This has prompted the western world to impose several sanctions on Russia.  This has primarily resulted in elevated prices of oil, gas and other fossil fuels. What has not been much discussed is the impact on food prices. The region is the most prominent wheat and sunflower oil supplier to the global markets. This has led to a spike in international prices of oilseeds.  There is also an impact on metal prices, which saw a sudden surge in the price of nickel contracts traded on the London Metal Exchange. The prices of other base metals such as aluminium, copper and steel have more than doubled over the last two years. The war has resulted in a shortage of semiconductor chips which was already impacted by the pandemic predating the war. The zero-COVID policy of the Chinese government has meant that there have been fresh lockdowns in China. This has further affected the global supply chain. This is also contributing in no small measure to rising inflationary pressures across the globe as China remains the factory of the world.  How does this impact India? What should the retail investor with a defensive mindset do in the current scenario? The fact remains that India has been badly affected by this bout of inflationary pressures. The government’s Budget numbers for the financial year, which ended, have been poorly affected on two counts: 1) The much anticipated LIC IPO, which was considered done in the Budget, has been delayed indefinitely. 2) The government has to spend more on fertilizer and fuel subsidies. This will mean more government borrowing, further stoking inflationary pressures.  In the current year, the Budget numbers have assumed a crude price of $75 a barrel and calculated subsidies based on these assumptions. It is now clear these are not tenable and need to be worked upon again. The rupee has been under pressure and steadily declined for the first three months of the year. This means that we are importing inflation by importing fuels, gold, edible oil, and a key component in our protein basket, dhal. Also, as the rest of the world tightens its monetary policy, we will have to follow suit or suffer a sharper devaluation of our currency. This will mean we will import more inflation which we can ill afford. First, we must remember a quote from John Maynard Keynes from the book The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money where, in chapter 12, he compares markets with a beauty contest, where judges are rewarded for selecting the most popular among all the faces rather than what they find personally appealing.  The rise in the value of the dollar and exports will mean a surge in the value of companies whose earnings are in dollars. A resurgent and robust American economy has meant IT exports have done well, and the IT index has surged by almost 50% and will continue to do well. Adding the pharma index to this basket might do an investor well.  It is reasonable to expect the price of gold to correct in dollars as interest rates climb in the second half and further increase the sales of gold retailing companies. The commodity itself may provide a buying opportunity. Further, the rally in the metal index has run its course due to two factors: 1) Further rise in the price of metals will dent demand for steel, copper, and aluminium. 2) A rise in interest rates will mean higher interest payments as most metal companies are highly indebted. Most FMCG companies see a significant correction as volumes contract when these large companies increase costs to offset input inflationary pressures. So during the year, it will be advisable to book profits in metals and move to the FMCG index. This should be done gradually as the market corrects. Selling pressure from foreign institutional investors may allow us to enter the private banking sector at more reasonable valuations.  There is room for a great opportunity, but the reader must remember that ‘markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent’ (John Maynard Keynes). The retail investor has to remain patient and cautious during this year. (Anand Srinivasan is a consultant and can be reached at anand.s.srinivsan@gmail.com.

93,"April 03, 2022",20:31 IST,business,economy,India’s GDP can grow to $40 trillion if working-age population gets employment: CII report,"  India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) can grow from the current $3 trillion to $9 trillion by 2030, and $40 trillion by 2047, if the country’s working-age population — which is expected to increase by over 100 million people between 2020-30, is productively employed, according to a report by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). The report also cautioned that if India does not create enough jobs and its workers are not adequately prepared for those jobs, its demographic dividend may turn into a liability. This, it added, can be done on a sustained basis only with changes in its policy frameworks for education and workforce management. “Since the job market is biased towards high-skill labour, the creation of jobs for low-skill labour, who would continue to dominate its workforce, will challenge India,” it said. In 2020, there were about 900 million people (67% of total population) in the working age group of 15-64 in India, which is expected to expand by another 100 million by 2030, despite a declining trend in fertility rate. This implies that a whopping 24.3% of the incremental global workforce over the next decade will come from India, the report states. “The golden period of 30 years between 2020-50 where our working age population will bulge can be an important horizontal enabler to bolster growth, even as the developed world including China ages,” the report notes. The report adds that over the years, India has experienced rising literacy rates, but level of vocational training/skilling is low, which gets reflected in the high unemployment rate among the educated. “Closing the skill gaps of its qualified workforce will be critical, as India depends more on human capital than its peer countries that have a similar level of economic development,” it said, adding that skilling and reskilling require a coordinated response from the government, industry, academia even as COVID continues to cause structural changes to the workplace. “The reversal in India’s structural transformation back toward agriculture is a sign of fall back to subsistence employment. Enhanced safety nets through PM-KISAN and the MGNREGA will be critical investments needed to ensure that incomes of small and marginal farmers are protected and their basic needs are met… But manufacturing and services will still have to be the two key growth engines going forward,” it said.",Yuthika Bhargava,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/indias-gdp-can-grow-to-40-trillion-if-working-age-population-gets-employment-cii-report/article65286806.ece

According to the survey, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is likely to start a rate hike cycle in the second half of 2022, while a repo rate hike of 50-75 bps is expected by the end of the current fiscal.  The RBI is expected to continue supporting the ongoing economic recovery by keeping the repo rate unchanged in its April policy review, the survey said.  ""The latest round of FICCI's Economic Outlook Survey puts forth an annual median GDP growth forecast for 2022-23 at 7.4% with a minimum and maximum growth estimate of 6% and 7.8% respectively,"" the industry body said.  The median growth forecast for agriculture and allied activities has been put at 3.3% for 2022-23. Industry and services sectors are estimated to grow by 5.9% and 8.5%, respectively.  However, it said, the downside risks to growth remains escalated.  While the threat from the COVID-19 pandemic is still looming, the continuation of Russia-Ukraine conflict is posing a significant challenge to global recovery, the survey said.  Rising international commodity prices is the biggest risk emanating from the ongoing conflict as Russia and Ukraine are global suppliers of key commodities, it said. The conflict, if continues for a longer period, will further hit supplies of major raw materials, including crude oil, natural gas, food, fertilizers, and metals, it added.  The economists who participated in the survey have also opined that the global inflation is likely to peak out in the first half of 2022 and moderate thereafter.  With India being a net importer to meet its energy requirements, the sharp rise in crude prices represents a significant shock to India's macro-economic framework. Moreover, the impact on economy is expected to be more serious if the conflict prolongs, the survey said.  The FICCI's Economic Outlook Survey was conducted in March this year to gauge the response from economists representing sectors like industry, banking and financial services. The economists were asked for their forecast on key macro-economic variables for 2022-23, Q4 (January- March) of FY22 and Q1 (April-June) of FY23, it said.

95,"April 03, 2022",16:43 IST,business,economy,India on cusp of major economic recovery; talks of stagflation overhyped: Niti Aayog VC Rajiv Kumar,"  India is on the cusp of a major economic recovery and talks of possible stagflation are “overhyped” as a strong economic foundation is being laid with the reforms carried out by the government over the last seven years, Niti Aayog Vice Chairman Rajiv Kumar said on April 3. Notwithstanding economic uncertainties triggered by the Russia-Ukraine war that is also impacting global supply chains, Mr. Kumar asserted that it was quite clear from all accounts that India will remain the fastest growing economy in the world. “Given all the reforms that we have done in the last seven years, and given that we are seeing the end of the COVID-19 pandemic hopefully, and the 7.8% rate of growth that we will get this year (2022-23), a very strong foundation is now being laid for further rapid increase in economic growth in the coming years,” Mr. Kumar told PTI in an interview. Asia’s third-largest economy is projected to grow 8.9% in 2021-22, according to recent government data. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has pegged the economic growth rate for 2022-23 at 7.8%. “So, I think India is on the cusp of a major economic recovery and economic growth,” Mr. Kumar said even as he acknowledged that because of the Russia-Ukraine war, India’s GDP growth projection could be revised. “But even then, India will remain the fastest growing economy and all the other economic parameters are actually quite within the range,” he said. Russia started its military offensive against Ukraine on February 24. Western nations, including the U.S., have imposed major economic and various other sanctions on Russia following the offensive. On rising inflation, the Niti Aayog Vice-Chairman said that the RBI is keeping a close watch as per its mandate. “I am sure that the RBI is well in control of it [inflation] and will take the necessary steps if and when required,” he said. Retail inflation hit an eight-month high of 6.07% in February, remaining above the RBI’s comfort level for the second month in a row while wholesale price-based inflation soared to 13.11% on account of hardening of crude oil and non-food item prices. The RBI keeps a close watch on the CPI inflation while deciding on its bi-monthly monetary policy. The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has been given the mandate to maintain annual inflation at 4% until March 31, 2026, with an upper tolerance of 6% and a lower tolerance of 2%. Regarding concerns over possible risk of stagflation, Mr. Kumar said the Indian economy is projected to grow 7.8% in the current fiscal and this is nowhere near the definition of stagflation. “I think this has been overhyped, because when you talk about stagflation, we talk about growth rates which are much below your rate of growth or potential output, which is not true at all for this time,” he emphasised. Stagflation is defined as a situation where inflation as well as unemployment are high and demand also remains stagnant in the economy. About the Government meeting the target of raising ₹88,000 crore from asset monetisation in 2021-22 financial year ended March 31, Mr. Kumar said, “I have heard this [target] will be achieved or if not, [then we will be] very close to the target. We have a number of things in the pipeline, and a number of ministries have taken initiatives. So, I think this will be well on track.” Last year, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced a ₹6 lakh crore-National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) over a four-year period that will look to unlock value in infrastructure assets across sectors ranging from power to road and railways. Niti Aayog in consultation with infrastructure line ministries has prepared the report on NMP. Regarding high petrol and diesel prices, Mr. Kumar said that given the global situation, fuel prices are rising across the world.
“In the past, the government had taken steps to reduce the tax burden. And I think, it’s time now for the states to come forward if they feel that this is required to be done,” he said. In any case, Mr. Kumar asserted, the Government keeps a close watch on prices of all commodities including fuel and will take steps as necessary.

If there is electricity, we can’t find baking ingredients, or there is not enough water,” he says, parked at Dematagoda, a Colombo working-class suburb where many low-income families displaced by development at the city centre have been rehoused. “When we somehow find everything, and bring bread and buns for sale, people say they can’t afford to buy them anymore. This is the situation.” It is dire, by all accounts. Hospitals are putting off surgeries without enough medical supplies, ink and newsprint shortages have forced newspapers to suspend editions, and schools have postponed term exams because there is no paper to print the questions. For a daily-wage worker like Kumara, if earnings are slashed by half, it means one meal less a day. The 48-year-old vendor works for a small bakery, spending part of his daily earnings on hiring his vehicle and precious diesel. He saves the rest to support his family of four in Minuwangoda, in the neighbouring Gampaha district. “People are starving today. That is what they [those in power] have done to us,” he says. Kumara was among the 6.9 million people who voted for President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in November 2019, propelling the former soldier to the country’s most powerful seat. That, followed by a thumping two-thirds majority in parliament in 2020, made the Rajapaksas nearly as formidable as they were in 2010, just after the “victory” in the war. But their renewed popularity after five years in opposition, which even withstood the early blows of the pandemic, is now crumbling. The scale of this economic crisis is unprecedented, making it arguably the worst in the island’s history. The Sri Lankan rupee has plummeted in value against the U.S. dollar with importers now needing LKR 300 (and much more on the black market) to buy one dollar. The country’s foreign exchange reserves were already under strain after the Easter Sunday terror attacks of 2019 halted tourist arrivals and foreign investment inflows slowed down. Reserves are now barely enough to pay for a month’s imports. The dollar crunch and severe shortages of essentials are grabbing global headlines, often accompanied by pat explanations of a “Chinese debt trap” or “Ukraine war impact”, with much less airtime for Sri Lanka’s own story. Families are skipping tea and foregoing meals, queuing up for hours to buy cooking gas or kerosene, and coping with day-long electricity cuts in this season of sweltering heat. They see “failed leadership” as the reason for their plight, not some complex macroeconomic puzzle. “I thought Gotabaya would be different from the others. He helped us win the war [against the LTTE]. As Secretary [to the Defence Ministry under which the Urban Development Authority functions], he developed and beautified Colombo. But as President he is unable to do even what he did as Secretary,” Kumara says, echoing the growing disenchantment among supporters. Gotabaya’s once appealing and powerful image as a leader who promised ‘vistas of splendour and prosperity’ has fallen. The hashtag #GotaGoHome was trending last month among Sri Lankans on Twitter, later overtaken by #RajapaksasGoHome. Middle-class citizens and the political opposition are on the streets every day, protesting against the government’s failings and indifference to the misery of the people. On Thursday night, hundreds of people took their rage right to the doorstep of Gotabaya’s Colombo residence, chanting slogans asking him to quit. Sri Lanka’s ruling administration has four Rajapaksa brothers and one son in the Cabinet, in addition to other family members in prominent positions. Months into the economic meltdown, none of them has shown signs of recognising the suffering of the people, let alone take responsibility for it. “This crisis was not created by me,” Gotabaya said in a televised address on March 16. He was not entirely wrong. The COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on key foreign exchange earners — tourism, garment and tea exports, and migrant workers’ remittances — dealt a deadly blow to an economy already reeling from the shock of the Easter Sunday bombings. Editorial | Sri Lanka’s rage In fact, the crisis announced its arrival in stages, since the outbreak of COVID-19 — in the mass sacking and deportation of Sri Lankan workers in West Asian countries, raging infections that stalled production factories catering to the export market, the closure of commercial establishments during lockdowns, and the consequent losses of jobs and incomes. In 2020 alone, real GDP contracted by 3.6%. At the macro level, a significant drop in export revenue, a high import bill (over $20 billion in 2021) and impending foreign debt obligations totalling nearly $7 billion this year were obvious warning signs. “This government knew for the last two years that our economy was going to crash. Even then it was in denial. It had no plan, no strategy,” says S. Kalidasan, who works at a neighbourhood eatery in Colombo to support his wife and three children living in Hatton, in the Central Province. “A worker who earns about 1,200 rupees for a day’s labour can barely buy a packet of milk powder with it today,” he says, referring to an essential item in Sri Lanka, whose dairy sector relies heavily on imported milk powder. Food inflation hit a record high of over 25% in February, with the prices of rice, pulses, fish, chicken, vegetables, and coconut skyrocketing. The President’s decision from 2020 to restrict imports, including of food items and inputs into agriculture, was aimed at conserving foreign exchange. Driven by that logic, he banned chemical fertilizer imports in May 2021, forcing the country to switch abruptly to organic farming. The move is now posing a serious threat to Sri Lanka’s food security. The import restrictions were neither based on a considered strategy (imported luxury foods can still be found in supermarkets) nor were they accompanied by a corresponding boost in domestic production that could have stabilised consumer prices. After mass protests by farmer groups, many from among the regime’s core constituencies, the government in November 2021 rowed back on its evidently ill-advised policy on agrochemicals. But the damage had been done. Crop scientists have predicted a dramatic reduction in annual harvests — a 40-45% drop in paddy yield alone. Less than a year after its ban on chemical fertilizers, the government is now forced to import more food staples including rice. The outcome is the opposite of what it had intended. As fears of hunger and starvation grow, the government is seeking help from near and far. In February, the Ministry of Trade said it was importing 3,00,000 tonnes of rice from India and 1,00,000 tonnes from Myanmar to control rice prices locally. Last week, the Chinese government announced a gift of 2,000 tonnes of rice to Sri Lanka. Apart from food grains, cash-strapped Sri Lanka is also frantically seeking financial help from different sources. India has extended $2.4 billion emergency support this year. China is “studying” a fresh request from Colombo for assistance of $2.5 billion, in addition to the $2.8 billion that Beijing has extended since the outbreak of the pandemic. Significantly, India and China are yet to respond to Colombo’s requests to freeze repayments or restructure its outstanding debt to them. After initial reluctance, Colombo is now turning to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) — a popular policy prescription from the political opposition, think-tanks, and diplomatic missions. The move, they say, will boost Sri Lanka’s global credit rating, which fell sharply last year, and enable new borrowings internationally. Even if IMF support, possibly amounting to a few billion dollars, comes through in some time, Sri Lanka is far from recovery, analysts caution. “IMF support is critical at this time for some relief, but they will ask the government to cut expenditure and increase tax revenue,” contends K. Amirthalingam, Professor of Economics at the University of Colombo. “I am not sure this is the right time for raising taxes when people’s purchasing power is so low and they are already suffering.” Also read | Sri Lanka’s media clarification reveals two recent defence pacts   with India There are at least 5 lakh “new poor” people in Sri Lanka after the pandemic, the World Bank stated in a recent report, warning that Sri Lanka’s “relatively high levels of inequality” pre-pandemic are likely to grow. As will poverty, especially with no universal social security or public distribution system, which was systematically dismantled after Sri Lanka liberalised its economy in 1977. Successive governments saw these as redundant in the ‘growth story’ that they were optimistically scripting through those decades. Today, all that remains is free public education until university, and the enviable public health system that proved vital during the pandemic. The monthly allowance — revised recently up to LKR 4,500 (roughly ₹ 1,160) — under the government’s targeted cash assistance programme, Samurdhi, is “barely enough to buy a gas cylinder,” says Professor Amirthalingam. The LKR 5,000 (about ₹1,290), from a “relief package” announced by the government for the months of April and May, is a pittance when prices soar on a daily basis. In his view, despite Sri Lanka’s open economic policy since the 1970s, no government focused enough on diversifying exports or reducing the country’s import-reliance. “We are an island, and we import tinned fish,” he scoffs, pointing to an “abject policy failure”. The promise of a liberalised economy in Sri Lanka began half a century ago. It emerged as a compelling counter to then Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike’s import restrictions, also in response to a foreign exchange crisis, resulting in an acute shortage of food and essentials. “Produce or perish” she told the country at the time. In their current predicament of waiting in long lines, many see a playback of the early 1970s. The public disaffection over Bandaranaike’s economic policy led to the emphatic 1977 poll victory of J.R. Jayewardene as President. He opened the Sri Lankan economy to the private sector, foreign trade, and capital movements, setting a regional precedent. In doing so, he irreversibly altered the island nation’s economic path. No successor government would choose to change this even if it spoke the language of welfarism from the electoral podium, like the Rajapaksas. The Rajapaksa brand, built mostly by the eldest of the brothers, former two-term President and current Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, defies a neat ideological label in its economic policy. The Rajapaksas’ social welfarism as patronage politics and resistance to privatisation has coexisted with a steadfastness to Sri Lanka’s traditional export basket and ready embrace of big capital, even if in state-led projects. During Mahinda Rajapaksa’s first term, the government shunned multilateral loans that came with conditions. It instead opted for high-interest loans from bilateral partners or through sovereign bonds, to fund mega infrastructure projects in a country that was still at war. Just after the war ended in 2009, Sri Lanka saw a mini economic boom, buoyed by the construction of expressways and other road projects, a mega port, and an airport, most of which are yet to generate revenue to even meet the operating costs. When Gotabaya Rajapaksa ran for Presidency a decade later, he promised to resurrect the country’s “neglected” villages and to pursue “people-centric” economic development. But his rash ban on chemical imports for agriculture crushed any hope that farmers had of sustaining production and income during the pandemic. People’s distress has only grown in the past two years. The overnight switch to organic farming was not the only injudicious move of the government. In late 2019, it substantially cut indirect taxes, while shrinking the income tax net, and caused a drastic cut in government revenue. It took hardly any time for the pandemic, arriving months later, to accelerate the downturn. Self-assured of its political might, the ruling administration appeared unperturbed by the fast-unfolding economic calamity. Even staunch supporters now see the Rajapaksas’ disastrous misgovernance as a reflection of the leaders’ overconfidence and disconnect with the public that once adored them. Meanwhile, the poorest are bearing the heaviest burden of the crisis that will likely deepen in the coming weeks. Last Sunday, domestic worker M.Y.N. Zuhira stood in a queue for four hours in the sun for a gas cylinder. “At least I got it,” she says, from her home in Dematagoda. With a daily wage of LKR 800 (roughly ₹205), she cannot eat three meals a day unless she pools her earnings with a relative next door. “That way, there is a little more rice for all of us,” she says. The economic crisis has hit the urban poor the hardest, but it has not spared most others. Many from Colombo’s English-speaking elite, who otherwise scorn protests as a “nuisance to the public”, are now regulars at daily and weekly protests on the crisis, demanding better leadership and solutions. In mid-March, 16 Tamils from the war-affected north fled to Tamil Nadu claiming destitution. Immigration authorities have noted the sharp increase in applications for new passports — some 1,61,394 since January this year — as scores of young men and women from working families try going abroad for domestic or construction work. “So many people I know in our village are preparing to leave the country. Two of my relatives are going to Saudi [Arabia] and Qatar. They see no future here,” says Kalidasan. “The government might keep a lid on essential food prices until Sinhala-Tamil New Year in April. After that, it might just go out of control.” Asking not to be named fearing “repercussions”, his boss says, “The coronavirus hit all countries in the world. But the crisis is affecting only us. Then whose fault is it really? The leadership only.” If the public resentment is any indication, the Rajapaksas will have to pay a price. But in the absence of an impending election, it remains to be seen if the popular anger now transforms into a real political challenge. The fragmented and reactive political opposition seems to be gaining strength and momentum in recent weeks, seen in the large rallies of the main opposition party, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya, which occupies less than a fourth of the 225 seats in the legislature, and the leftist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna. Two critical factors over the next few months will determine Sri Lanka’s economic revival and the regime’s political fortunes: President Gotabaya’s ability to arrest the devastating impact of the crisis, and the opposition’s chances at winning the people’s confidence as a credible political alternative. Even now, there is nothing to suggest that the government has a strategy going beyond the next few days or weeks. Its response to the enormous challenge so far is, at best, piecemeal. The political costs of this crisis will affect just the Rajapaksas, but the economic aftermath will be the country’s to bear.",Meera Srinivasan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/in-sri-lanka-an-economic-crisis-foretold/article65282210.ece

100,"April 01, 2022",19:59 IST,business,economy,GST collections hit new high in March," India’s gross Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections hit a record ₹1,42,095 crore in March, surpassing the January high of ₹1,40,986 crore and lifting the Centre’s projected gross tax revenues for 2021-22 significantly above the government’s revised estimates. The March GST revenues, for transactions undertaken in February, were 15% higher than the same month last year and 46% higher than the collections in March 2020. Revenues from import of goods were 25% higher and the revenues from domestic transactions, including import of services, were 11% higher than a year earlier. The Finance Ministry asserted that the highest ever monthly GST kitty indicated that a faster recovery was underway in business activity, pointing to the fact that the number of e-way bills generated in February exceeded January’s 6.88 crore figure by three lakh ‘despite being a shorter month’.  The last quarter of 2021-22 clocked average monthly collections of ₹1.38 lakh crore, compared with ₹1.3 lakh crore in the preceding quarter. The average was significantly lower in the first and second quarters of the last fiscal year, at ₹1.1 lakh crore and ₹1.15 lakh crore, respectively. Apart from the economic recovery, the ministry said that ‘anti-evasion activities against fake billers’ had also helped bolster GST collections. “The record GST collections have also been aided by the strong sales activity of corporates in March, as they race to close the financial year with high growth,” said M.S. Mani, partner at Deloitte India.  ICRA chief economist Aditi Nayar reckoned that GST revenues would rise further in April, thanks to improved economic activity and year-end adjustments, adding that the kitty collected in March was in line with the resurgence in e-way bill generation.  “Higher GST collections, in addition to customs duty revenues driven by the rebound in gold imports in February, combined with direct taxes, are likely to have pushed up the Government of India’s gross tax revenues well above the revised estimates for the year,” Ms. Nayar said, positing that actual collections would have likely ‘overshot’ the ₹27.6 lakh crore revised estimate by a considerable ₹2.25 lakh crore.  Though revenues from domestic transactions and import of services grew 11% from March 2021 levels, the trends were mixed among major States. Revenues rose 26% in Odisha, 19% in Maharashtra, 17% in Haryana and 12% in Gujarat. West Bengal’s GST collections grew just 2%, while they rose 6% in Uttar Pradesh.  Among the southern States, Andhra Pradesh’s GST revenues increased by 18%, followed by 14% growth in Kerala, 11% in Karnataka and just 6% in Tamil Nadu. Telangana’s kitty grew by a mere 2%.

102,"April 01, 2022",00:11 IST,business,economy,No change in interest on small savings," The government on Thursday opted to leave interest rates on small savings instruments like the Public Provident Fund unchanged for April to June 2022, maintaining the status quo for the eighth successive quarter.  The Reserve Bank of India had indicated the need to pare interest rates on these schemes between 0.09 and 1.18 percentage points in the coming quarter. However, the resurgence of inflation beyond 6% in the last two months and the upswing in oil prices may have weighed against taking an unpopular step, especially after the Employees’ Provident Fund rate for 2021-22 was reduced from 8.5% to 8.1% earlier this month, the lowest in over 42 years.  The rates on various small savings schemes were last reduced in the range of 0.5 and 1.4 percentage points in April 2020, and an announcement of further cuts ranging from 0.4% to 1.1% on March 31 , 2022, was revoked by April 1.   The quarterly interest rate paid on one year term deposits remains 5.5%, Senior Citizen Savings’ Scheme will continue to earn 7.4%, while the Sukanya Samriddhi Account Scheme’s return is 7.6%. The PPF return will remain at 7.1%.    ICRA chief economist Aditi Nayar said small savings rates may be increased in the latter half of the year following expected rate hikes by the central bank through August and October.  “With the rise in yields on government securities over the last three months, as well as the inching up of deposit rates of banks, we had foreseen a small probability of the small savings rates being revised upwards for the coming quarter,” she noted. ",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/no-change-in-interest-on-small-savings/article65278630.ece
103,"March 31, 2022",20:44 IST,business,economy,"Policies of oil marketing firms hampering ethanol output, ISMA tells MPs"," The country has enough raw material to produce 1,016 crore litres of ethanol by 2025 for blending with petrol, but policies of oil marketing companies and other factors are restricting the output of the fuel additive, according to industry body ISMA. In a presentation before Members of Parliament (MPs), Indian Sugar Mills Association Director General Abinash Verma on Thursday said that about 10% ethanol blending with petrol was expected in the current (2022) year. A target had been set for 20% ethanol blending by 2025. To achieve the 20% blending target, the ISMA DG said about 1,016 crore litres of ethanol was required, and for which the raw material is available, but there was a need to augment production capacity with mills as well as necessary infrastructure and storage with oil marketing companies (OMCs). The government had put in place ‘encouraging’ policies for capacity creation, but delay in bank loans is creating hurdles. That apart, OMCs’ policies remain “restrictive”, it said. The Union Food Ministry has given in-principle approvals to 983 projects since 2018 under interest subvention schemes which have been extended time and again for new investors. On the other hand, OMCs - which invited bids in August 2021 for additional capacity creation of 648 litres - have approved 131 project proponents for about 400 crore litres in annual capacity. The ISMA DG said, however, banks were not willing to sanction loans if two conditions were not met: one was the in-principle approval of the Food Ministry; the other was long-term bipartite purchase agreements (BPAs) between OMCs and project proponents. Thus, only 67 projects were eligible as per the banks' guidelines, he said, adding that some may not be found credit-worthy by banks.  Further, there are problems in the Expression of Interest (EoI) of OMCs for BPAs as errors are found in shortlisting projects.  OMCs have ignored sugarcane producing States and given large allocations to non-cane producing States such as Kerala and Jammu & Kashmir. ""OMCs are not signing the long-term purchase agreements with existing ethanol producers and new ethanol plants which are not interested in the concessional loans,"" the DG said.  To overcome the problem of finances for capacity creation, the ISMA said necessary approvals for bank loans should be given within seven days from the date of application by the companies.  ""Otherwise, the pace of capacity creation will see a major fall, and achieving 20% ethanol production by 2025 will become extremely difficult,"" it said. The industry body also said that storage capacities at depots of OMCs across the country needed to be augmented. Even the Indian railway network and laying of pipelines would be crucial.  ""For dispensing higher ethanol blended petrol as also pure ethanol, there is a need for OMCs to make necessary changes at retail pumps/stations,"" it said.  ISMA further said it was crucial to augment demand and use of more ethanol. Therefore, there was a need to introduce flexi-fuel vehicles as early as possible to achieve 20% ethanol blending by 2025, it said.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/policies-of-oil-marketing-firms-hampering-ethanol-output-isma-tells-mps/article65278706.ece

Crude oil and fertiliser production fell 2.2% and 1.4% year-on-year, respectively.  Economists attributed February’s numbers largely to the base effect, as February 2021 had recorded a 3.3% contraction in core sector production. In fact, the overall index of eight core industries released on Thursday fell 5.3% compared with January 2022, with all sectors witnessing a month-on-month dip. Cement, for instance, grew 5% compared with February 2021, but output was 4.4% lower than in January 2022. Similarly, refinery products’ output was up 8.8%, but 7.3% lower than the preceding month. Steel production grew for the second month in a row after contracting in December, rising 5.7% in February. Electricity generation grew 4%, while natural gas and coal output grew 12.5% and 6.6%, respectively. The continued contraction in crude oil and fertilisers, and sharp moderation in cement output growth cast a sobering note, said ICRA chief economist Aditi Nayar, who estimates the index of industrial production (IIP) to rise less than 2.5% in February. The core sectors account for about 40% of the IIP. Economists at India Ratings and Research Sunil K. Sinha and Paras Jasrai noted that the 5.8% growth in core sectors had been attained on a low base from last February, while crude oil, refinery and fertiliser production is still below pre-pandemic levels. “Production of other core segments are also just above the pre-COVID level. This shows that there is still a long way to go so far as revival of core sectors’ output is concerned and the disruption to global supply chains may further impinge on the availability of key raw materials like natural gas and coal in the domestic market due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict,” they said.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/core-sectors-rise-58-in-february/article65278393.ece

As generators strive to meet requirements, a fall in the national coal inventory is forcing the government to withold supply to other sectors and suspend fuel auctions by companies that do not have contracted supply. Many northern States suffered hours-long power outages in October, when a crippling coal shortage caused the worst electricity deficit in almost five years. The deficit in March was 574 million kilowatt-hours, a measure that multiplies power level by duration, a Reuters analysis of data from federal grid regulator POSOCO showed. That amounted to 0.5% of overall demand for the period, or half the deficit of 1% in October. Shortages in the eastern State of Jharkhand and Uttarakhand in the north surpassed those of October, the data showed. The southern State of Andhra Pradesh and the tourist resort State of Goa, which registered marginal shortages in October, suffered deficits several times larger in March. The northern States of Haryana, Rajasthan and Punjab and the eastern state of Bihar, some parts of which suffered widespread outages in October, accounted for most of the deficit in March, but shortfalls were lower, the data showed.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/indias-march-electricity-shortage-is-the-worst-since-coal-crisis-in-october/article65278177.ece

The South Asian nation is in the grips of its worst economic downturn since independence, sparked by an acute lack of foreign currency to pay for even the most essential imports. Diesel – the main fuel for buses and commercial vehicles – was unavailable at stations across the island, according to officials and media reports. Petrol was on sale but in short supply, forcing motorists to abandon their cars in long queues. “We are siphoning off fuel from buses that are in the garage for repairs and using that diesel to operate serviceable vehicles,” Transport Minister Dilum Amunugama said. Owners of private buses – which account for two-thirds of the country’s fleet – said they were already out of oil and that even skeleton services may not be possible after Friday. “We are still using old stocks of diesel, but if we don’t get supplies by this evening, we will not be able to operate,” chairman of the private bus operators association Gemunu Wijeratne told AFP. The state electricity monopoly said they would be forced to enforce a 13-hour power cut from Thursday – the longest ever – because they did not have diesel for generators. “We are promised new supplies in two days and if that happens, we can reduce the length of power cuts,” Ceylon Electricity Board chairman M. M. C. Ferdinando told reporters. He said hydro reservoirs, which provide more than a third of electricity demand, were also dangerously low. The lengthy power cuts forced the Colombo Stock Exchange to limit its trading by half to two hours, while many offices asked non-essential staff to stay at home. The electricity rationing also hit mobile phone base stations and affected the quality of calls, operators said, adding that their stand-by generators were also without diesel. The shortages have sparked outrage across Sri Lanka, with local television reporting protests across the country as hundreds of motorists block main roads in several towns. Several state-run hospitals have stopped surgeries as they have run out of essential life-saving medicines, while most have stopped diagnostic tests which require imported chemicals that are in short supply. Colombo imposed a broad import ban in March 2020 in a bid to save foreign currency needed to service its $51 billion in foreign debt. But this has led to widespread shortages of essential goods and sharp price rises. The government has said it is seeking a bailout from the International Monetary Fund while asking for more loans from India and China. Sri Lanka’s predicament was exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, which torpedoed tourism and remittances. Many economists also blame government mismanagement including tax cuts and years of budget deficits.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sri-lanka-runs-out-of-diesel-faces-longest-ever-blackout/article65277140.ece
109,"March 31, 2022",10:27 IST,business,economy,India has safeguards in place to mitigate risks from capital flows: IMF," India, which has received a record number of foreign direct investment during the last few years despite COVID-19 crisis, has quite a few safeguards in place to mitigate the risks from capital flows, the International Monetary Fund said Wednesday.  “Capital flows have several benefits. They finance needed investments. They help insure against some kinds of risks. There are many benefits to countries from having capital flows in India and also benefits from receiving those capital flows,” IMF’s First Deputy Managing Director, Gita Gopinath, told reporters here.  The IMF on Wednesday released a paper on the Review of the Institutional View (IV) on the Liberalization and Management of Capital Flows. The IV was adopted in 2012 and provides the basis for consistent Fund advice on policies related to capital flows.  The IV aims to help countries reap the benefits of capital flows while managing the associated risks in a way that preserves macroeconomic and financial stability and does not generate significant negative outward spillovers. The Review introduces important changes that expand the toolkit for policymakers, such as allowing the pre-emptive use of capital flow measures on inflows if financial vulnerabilities exist.  In response to a question, Ms. Gopinath noted that there are other kinds of financial risks associated with having large amounts of capital inflows.  “In the case of India, there are a large number of capital restrictions already in place. The Indian government uses these restrictions quite proactively in dealing when the external environment changes. So, by putting restrictions on the amount of external borrowing the corporates can do, that is an instrument that they use. And they use it in response to changing external circumstances.” “So, there are quite a few safeguards that the Indian economy has in terms of capital flows. But of course, it is still in the process of liberalizing its capital accounts. And as its financial markets deepen, it’s financial institutions deepen, it could move towards more, allowing for more forms of capital flows,” Ms. Gopinath said.  The top IMF official said, capital flows are desirable because they can bring substantial benefits to recipient countries. But they can also result in macro-economic challenges and financial stability risks, she said.  ""The dramatic capital outflows we witnessed at the start of the global pandemic, and the recent turbulence and capital flows to some emerging markets following the war in Ukraine are stark reminders of how volatile capital flows can be and the impact this can have on economies,” Ms. Gopinath said.  In the aftermath of the great financial crisis, where interest rates were low for a long time in advanced economies, capital flow to emerging markets in search of high returns, she said. In some countries, this led to a gradual buildup of their external debt in foreign currency, which was not offset by foreign currency assets or hedges, she noted.  “Then when the taper tantrum struck and there was a sudden loss of appetite for emerging market debt, it led to severe financial distress in some markets. Now the lessons learned from such episodes and from a large body of research is that in some circumstances, countries should have the option of preemptively curbing debt inflows to safeguard macro-economic and financial stability,” Ms. Gopinath said.  Accordingly, the main update to the policy toolkit released by the IMF is the addition of capital flow management measures and macro prudential policies that can be applied preemptively.  “But when used appropriately, these measures reduce the likelihood of a financial crisis in the event of a sudden reversal of capital inputs. This change builds on the integrated policy framework, a research effort by the IMF to build a systematic framework to analyze policy options and tradeoffs in response to shocks given country specific characteristics,” she said.  The latest IMF report, she said, highlights the risks to financial stability that can arise from a gradual buildup of external debt liabilities, especially when these generate currency mismatches, and narrow and exceptional cases from foreign debt denominated in local currency.  “Preemptive capital flow management measures and macro prudential policy to restrict inflows can mitigate risks from external debt. Yet they should not be used in a manner that leads to excessive distortions, nor should they substitute for necessary macro-economic and structural policies or views to keep currencies excessively weak,” Ms. Gopinath said.  “Another update to our advice is to give special treatment to some categories of capital flow measures governed by certain other international frameworks for security considerations. It also provides practical guidance for policy advice related to capital flow measures including how to identify capital inflow surges and how to decide whether it is premature to liberalize capital flows,” she added.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/india-has-safeguards-in-place-to-mitigate-risks-from-capital-flows-imf/article65276887.ece
110,"March 31, 2022",00:30 IST,business,economy,Explaining Sri Lanka’s economic crisis," The Sri Lankan economy has been facing a crisis owing to a serious balance of payments (BoP) problem. Its foreign exchange reserves are depleting rapidly. It is becoming increasingly difficult to import essential consumption goods. The country is unable to repay past debts. This article is an effort to locate the proximate causes of the current crisis and document the roles of different groups and organisations in its making. One can, of course, trace the roots of the crisis to colonialism and Sri Lanka’s post-war developmental pathway but let us stick to the last decade for our purposes. Even in the 21st century, Sri Lanka’s economic fortunes continued to be tied to the export of primary commodities such as tea and rubber, and garments. It mobilised foreign exchange reserves through primary commodity exports, tourism and remittances, and used it to import essential consumption items including food. Editorial | Crisis in Sri Lanka When Sri Lanka emerged from a 26-year long war in 2009, it was expected that economic growth would revive. Possibly because of pent-up demand, Sri Lanka’s post-war GDP growth was reasonably high at 8-9% per annum between 2009 and 2012. However, the economy was on a downward spiral after 2013 as global commodity prices fell, exports slowed down and imports rose. The average GDP growth rate almost halved after 2013. A counter-cyclical fiscal policy was ruled out, as the hands of the then Mahinda Rajapaksa government were tied by a $2.6 billion loan obtained from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2009. During the period of the war, budget deficits were high. Further, the capital flight that accompanied the global financial crisis of 2008 drained Sri Lanka’s foreign exchange reserves. The IMF loan in 2009 was obtained in this context, with the conditionality that budget deficits would be reduced to 5% of the GDP by 2011. With no pick-up in growth or exports, and the continuing drain of foreign exchange reserves, the new United National Party (UNP)-led coalition government approached the IMF in 2016 for another US$1.5 billion loan for a three-year period between 2016 and 2019. The IMF’s conditionality was that the fiscal deficit must be reduced to 3.5% by 2020. Other conditionalities included a reform of the tax policy and tax administration; control of expenditures; commercialisation of public enterprises; flexibility in exchange rates; improvement of competitiveness; and a free environment for foreign investment.  The IMF package led to a deterioration of Sri Lanka’s economic health. GDP growth rates shrank from 5% in 2015 to 2.9% in 2019. Investment rate fell from 31.2% in 2015 to 26.8% in 2019. Savings rate fell from 28.8% in 2015 to 24.6% in 2019. Government revenues shrank from 14.1% of the GDP in 2016 to 12.6% of the GDP in 2019. Gross government debt rose from 78.5% of the GDP in 2015 to 86.8% of the GDP in 2019. In 2019, there were two further shocks to the economy. First, the Easter bomb blasts of April 2019 in churches in Colombo led to the death of 253 people. Consequently, the number of tourists fell sharply leading to a decline in foreign exchange reserves. The blasts dealt a severe blow to the prospects of economic recovery. Secondly, the UNP-led government was replaced in November 2019 by a new government led by the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), headed by Gotabaya Rajapaksa. The SLPP had promised lower tax rates and wide-ranging sops for farmers during their campaign. On the surface, these promises appeared divergent from the IMF package. However, in the absence of a concrete policy alternative to the IMF’s neoliberal package, these promises were hollow. Gotabaya Rajapaksa was quick to implement the ill-advised plan to slash taxes. In December 2019, the value added tax (VAT) rates were reduced from 15% to 8%. The annual threshold for VAT registration was raised from LKR 12 million to LKR 300 million. The annual income threshold for waiver of personal income tax was raised from LKR 500,000 to LKR 3,000,000. The nation building tax, the PAYE tax and the economic service charges were abolished.  Estimates show that there was a 33.5% decline in the number of registered taxpayers between 2019 and 2020, and close to 2% of the GDP was lost in taxes thus foregone. GST/VAT revenues were halved between 2019 and 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 made the bad situation worse. Exports of tea, rubber, spices and garments suffered. Tourism arrivals and revenues fell further. The pandemic also necessitated a rise in government expenditures: the fiscal deficit exceeded 10% in 2020 and 2021, and the ratio of public debt to GDP rose from 94% in 2019 to 119% in 2021. Sri Lanka annually spent about $260 million (or about 0.3% of its GDP) on fertiliser subsidies. Most of the fertilisers are imported. To prevent the drain of foreign exchange reserves, the Gotabaya government came up with a novel, but thoroughly bizarre, solution in 2021. All fertiliser imports were completely banned from May 2021, and it was declared that Sri Lanka would overnight become a 100% organic farming nation. This policy, which was withdrawn in November 2021 after protests by farmers, literally pushed Sri Lanka to the brink of a disaster. Agricultural scientists were unanimous in warning the Gotabaya government of the potential losses from the organic farming policy. They wrote to the government that yields may drop by 25% in paddy, 35% in tea and 30% in coconut if chemical fertilisers were banned. The scientists were proven right. In February 2022, the IMF assessed that there was a “worse-than-anticipated impact of the chemical fertiliser ban on agricultural production”, which was likely to drag down the prospects of economic recovery. As agricultural production fell, more imports of food became necessary. But increasing imports was difficult in the face of foreign exchange shortages. Thus, inflation rose to 17.5% in February 2022. Also, a fall in the productivity of tea and rubber led to lower export incomes. And thus, the organic farming policy, which aimed to soften the pressure on reserves, ended up straining them even further. The current Sri Lankan economic crisis, then, is the product of the historical imbalances in the economic structure, the IMF’s loan-related conditionalities, misguided policies of authoritarian rulers and the official embrace of pseudo-science. The future looks bleak too. The government might approach the IMF once again for a new loan with fresh conditionalities. With the global outlook appearing dim, a renewed push to such a deflationary policy would not just limit the prospects of economic revival, but also exacerbate the sufferings of the Sri Lankan people.

111,"March 30, 2022",20:29 IST,business,economy,‘Small savings rates may not be raised for the coming quarter‘," The government is unlikely to raise small savings rates for the coming quarter when they are reviewed on Thursday, even though yields on government securities have hardened, a top official indicated, noting that the rates have not been cut for two financial years now.  Small savings rates had been last slashed in the range of 0.5% to 1.4% on different instruments in 2020, bringing the PPF rate to 7.1% from 7.9% prevalent till March 31, 2020.  Rate cuts ranging from 0.4 to 1.1 percentage points, were also announced last March, but were rolled back within hours, citing an ‘oversight’ in the middle of the West Bengal assembly election campaign. The interest rate on small savings instruments is reset every quarter, based on market yields on government securities (G-sec) with a lag, at a spread ranging from 0 to 100 basis points over and above yields of comparable maturities. The yield on the 10-year benchmark G-sec hardened to 6.86% on March 11 this year from a low of 6.6% on February 18. “Since rates were not reduced all this time, I don’t see an immediate possibility of them being raised,” a senior Finance Ministry official told The Hindu. Reducing rates may also be tricky as yields on G-secs have gone up, he noted.   The Reserve Bank of India noted this month that existing rates of interest on small savings need to be reduced in the range of 9-118 basis points (or 0.09 to 1.18 percentage points) for the first quarter of 2022-23 to align them with the formula-based rates. In January, this differential between the extant small savings rates and the rates determined by the formula stood in the range of 0.42 to 1.68 percentage points. Reacting to RBI’s call for paring small savings rates, the official stressed that interest rate discussions often get too focussed on borrowers’ needs. “The Government of India also wants to protect savers and senior citizens, for whom a fixed income is critical, so a rise in yields is not necessarily bad for those segments of the economy,” he pointed out.",Vikas Dhoot,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/small-savings-rates-may-not-be-raised-for-the-coming-quarter/article65275247.ece
113,"March 30, 2022",10:26 IST,business,economy,"Odisha economy grows by 10.1%, says State Economic Survey report"," Odisha’s economy has registered a sharp recovery in 2021-22 with Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) clocking a growth rate of 10.1%, says the Odisha Economic Survey which was tabled in the Assembly on Tuesday. “It is one of the fastest growing States in the country and has registered a growth rate much higher than India’s Gross Domestic Product growth rate of 8.8% as per the first advance estimate,” it says. Stating that Odisha faced the adverse impact of COVID-19 with the GSDP contracting by 5.3% in 2020-21 against a contraction of 6.6% in India’s GDP, the report says the State’s demonstrated far more resilience and reverted to the pre-pandemic level much faster.  “While India’s real GDP grew by 1.6% 2019-20 to 2021-22 leaving aside the COVID year of 2020-21, the comparable figure for Odisha is 4.2%. Not only Odisha’s recovery process is faster, but it is also more broad-based,” it maintains.  The survey has projected that the GSDP could grow by 9-9.5% in 2022-23 if there is normal monsoon, no furthermore damaging waves of coronavirus mutations and induced economic disruption, stable oil prices and steadily easing of supply chain. The Economic Survey, however, expressed concerns over the Russia and Ukraine conflict saying it may bring in further uncertainty.  Presenting a rosy picture about State’s financial health, it says the per capita income of Odisha has also grown at a double-digit rate of 16.8% in 2021-22.  “The average growth of Odisha’s per capita income over the last 10 years (2012-13 to 2021-22) is 10.3% against 9.15% growth rate in the case of India. Odisha’s per capita income of ₹48,499 in 2011-12 has reached ₹1,27,383 in 2021-22,” the survey says. Though per capita income of Odisha is still lower than that of India, the rate at which it is growing implied that it would soon exceed the country’s level. Odisha’s per capita income is 76% of the per capita income of India in 2011-12. (It stands now at 84.7% in 2021-22), the survey finds. According to the report, between 2011-12 and 2019-20, there are only nine States, including Odisha, whose per capita income rank has improved, while in the case of 10 States, there is no change in rank and another 10 States have dropped in per capita income ranking.  The improvement in per capital income has been mostly driven by growth in industry (14.5%) and service sector (7.9%). The survey points out that agriculture and allied sector has registered a contraction of 3.4% in 2021-22 due to drought, unseasonal rain, and cyclone. Inflation was estimate at 5.3%.

115,"March 30, 2022",00:15 IST,business,economy,A ‘doomsday’ book that launched a movement," Fifty years ago, a book titled The Limits to Growth, authored by a group of economic modellers, was published as part of a project on the predicament of mankind. The project was sponsored by the Club of Rome, an organisation founded in 1968 primarily by an Italian industrialist, Aurelio Peccei, and comprising leaders from various fields of human activity. The Club evolved from the concept of problematique, which was that the growing global problems of environmental deterioration, depleting natural resources, pollution, overpopulation, inequality, ill-health, crime, war, and religious attitudes, among others, which are inimical to the human well-being, are inter-related and require a system-based approach. This data-driven study was pioneered by the System Dynamics group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), led by Donella H. Meadows. It used a first-generation computer and codes and was far ahead of its time in its methodological approach. Still, what stumped the people of the day was its mind-blowing conclusion that the world system could collapse by 2070 given the human-induced changes in the environment combined with traditional economic growth models. The report, which recommended altering the growth model, which is rooted in the over-exploitation of finite natural resources, was also a wake-up call for action, as we do not have much time to lose. This book soon became a subject of vehement criticism for its ‘doomsday’ prediction. However, the lead author of the thesis denied the allegation and said that it was not written to “predict doom but to challenge people to find ways of living that are consistent with the laws of the planet”. On the conclusions of this book, the journal Nature, in its editorial dated March 10, 1972, reflecting the cynicism prevalent among the academic circles towards the book, called it ‘Another Whiff of Doomsday’. The earlier ‘whiff of doomsday’ referred to another book, World Dynamics, by J.W. Forrester of MIT, that, for the first time, developed the computer code for system analysis and was a forerunner to The Limits to Growth. The critics in those early days, when computer literacy was minimal, said that the inferences of the book were unconvincing and that the authors ignored what they believed to be the self-correcting capabilities of the Earth systems.  Also read | ‘The climate does not care’ But they were ignorant of the tipping points in any complex system — the thresholds where a tiny change can push a system into an entirely new state. This is because the scientific validity of tipping points came much later. The stable environmental conditions during the last 10,000 years, called the Holocene, helped humanity to thrive, but because of the exponential increase in the rate of change, we would reach the tipping point fast. Human activities, unprecedented in the geological past, were quickly predominating natural forces in shaping the environment. We are almost halfway to the 100-year mark predicted in The Limits to Growth, and there is a consensus that most of the fundamental factors discussed in the book have come true. Given the exponential growth of the population in parts of the world, the strain on precious natural resources has become acute, widening the gap between the haves and have-nots. The trend line presented in The Limits to Growth indicated that the global population might cross the seven billion-mark by the turn of the 20th century. The formal number available for the year 2000 was 6.11 billion, not considering the errors in understating the population in many poor countries. The formal number now is 7.9 billion. The population of impoverished regions of the world has gone up.  Indeed, technology has made some unbelievable progress in the last half a century. The report demonstrated that the process of economic growth, structurally based on Gross National Product (GDP) as a marker of growth, is inexorably widening the absolute gap between the rich and the poor along with the number of undernourished people. Not a single trend projected in the book has gone off the track in nearly 50 years. This realisation is reflected in  Nature’s editorial of March 16, 2022, commemorating the book’s 50th year, and advocates for global-level discussions on the GDP-based measures of economic performance.  When The Limits to Growth was first published, environmental awareness was minimal, and huge knowledge gaps existed on the problems related to pollution. This book was the first to raise the issue of pollution, including the rising level of carbon dioxide emissions from the use of conventional sources of energy. The physical sciences later proved that the computer models on the relationship between environmental degradation and quality of life, introduced in The Limits of Growth, were fundamentally correct. For instance, almost coinciding with the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, Johan Rockström and others, in a feature article dated September 24, 2009, in  Nature, cautioned that we do not have the luxury of treating each of the planetary boundaries in isolation as they are coupled. This means that if the Amazon forests are drastically reduced, it could influence the stability of mountain glaciers in far-off Tibet. Scientific research has shown how humanity has already transgressed three of the Earth system processes — climate change, rate of biodiversity loss, and the nitrogen cycle — and is fast approaching the boundaries for global freshwater use, change in land use, and ocean acidification. The Limits to Growth shaped human outlook on key existential issues towards the latter part of the 20th century. This is spilling over to the present times. In the end, the book put forward the “concept of a society in a steady state of economic and ecological equilibrium” and admitted that it requires a “Copernican revolution of mind” to attain those objectives. Most importantly, by implication, it helped raise doubts on the current economic models, which are purely based on GDP, which encourages profligacy, depletion of non-renewable resources and rising emissions. Contrarian concepts like “de-growth” and “post-growth” are gaining momentum among economic thinkers to tackle biophysical processes such as climate change. But political thinkers believe that monumental challenges exist as “de-growth” societies are organised around fundamentally different cultural, social, economic, political, and technological concepts as compared to those organised around the ideology of growth, both from the capitalistic and Marxian points of view. Even parts of Gandhian principles, including the concept of human cooperatives, assume importance in the context of de-growth options. As The Limits to Growth emphasises, the question is not only “whether the human species will survive, but whether it can survive without falling into a state of worthless existence”. C.P.

116,"March 29, 2022",20:57 IST,business,economy,"Oil price spikes, disruptions started couple of weeks ago, says Nirmala Sitharaman"," Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday attributed the fuel price hikes to disruptions in global oil markets over the past ‘couple of weeks’ due to the war in Ukraine, and said the government has an ‘honest’ approach towards oil prices unlike the UPA which relied on oil bonds.  The minister also said she expects the Wholesale Price Inflation to moderate in the coming year, while responding to the debate on the Finance Bill and Appropriation Bill of 2022 in the Rajya Sabha. The Upper House of Parliament returned the two Bills, completing the Budget 2022-23 exercise.  “I am tempted to talk about the oil prices. Just one line will probably explain it. We are dealing with a situation arising out of the global war-like situation. It was said that the war has been raging for a time and you didn’t raise it at that time, now you are raising it,” Ms. Sitharaman said in an 80-odd minute reply to points raised by MPs.  “[This is] Absolutely untrue, Sir. The disruption and the resultant increase in price of global oil and also disruption to supplies are all happening since a couple of weeks ago and we are responding to it. Various steps have been taken by the government,” she said, noting that inflation is being controlled in items like pulses.  Conceding that the NDA government led by Atal Behari Vajpayee had also issued oil bonds worth Rs. 9,000 crore, the minister said that was a one-time action unlike UPA’s ‘continuous policy’ leading to issuance of oil bonds worth Rs. 2 lakh crore that are still being repaid.  “The taxpayers of today are paying for subsidy dished out to consumers more than a decade ago in the name of oil bonds. And they will continue to pay for another five years,” she asserted. “So there is a honest way of funding oil at a higher cost and a way in which you just book it on somebody else and some other government keeps paying for it. We have not done that,” said Ms. Sitharaman.  Terming the government’s GDP growth estimates in the Budget as ‘conservative’, the minister said the Budget had not factored in the Omicron wave and highlighted the Russia-Ukraine war and the unprecedented hike in fuel prices as a new challenge.  “However, I want to submit before the members that we take a whole year’s picture for the economy, rather than reviewing it or reassessing it on a weekly or even a monthly basis. So far as the inflation is concerned, the Wholesale Price Index in the deflator has been very high this year compared to the Consumer Price Inflation (CPI). We are hopeful that the WPI indices will shrink going forward,” she noted.  Taking on former Finance Minister P Chidambaram’s critique of the Finance Bill and a query he raised about whether the government has lost its faith in private investors, Ms. Sitharaman said this was a very odd issue to flag.  “The pandemic created huge uncertainties that seriously impacted private sector investments. The government stepped in to fill the gap and create an environment necessary to revive and sustain investments from the private sector. We believe the government and private sector are partners in ushering development in the economy. There is no ‘Us vs Them’ when it comes to government versus private sector,” she noted, adding that higher public capital spending will help crowd in private investments.

Replying to the discussion on the Finance Bill, 2022, and Appropriation Bill, 2022, the minister said India continues to remain among the top five foreign direct investment recipient countries in the world, as per a UNCTAD report. The FDI inflow in 2020-21 was $81.72 billion compared to $74.9 billion in the preceding financial year. Despite the covid pandemic, she said the government did not resort to taxes for resource mobilisation and no tax was increased to fund the economic recovery. On the other hand, as per an OECD report, as many as 32 countries had resorted to an increase in their tax rates to fund their economic recoveries. Ms. Sitharaman also highlighted that the war between Russia and Ukraine is affecting all countries like the pandemic had. The finance minister also said ₹8.35 lakh crore has been devolved to states from central taxes in the current fiscal, higher than the revised estimate of ₹7.45 lakh crore for 2021-22.

119,"March 29, 2022",19:13 IST,business,economy,Regulator's 5G recommendations in 7-10 days; work in final stages: TRAI Secretary," Telecom regulator TRAI's much-awaited recommendations on 5G spectrum pricing and other modalities will come out in the next 7-10 days, a senior official said on Tuesday. Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) Secretary V. Raghunandan told PTI that the spectrum reference given to the regulator spanned multiple bands and thereby involved detailed and exhaustive deliberations. ""We are in the final stages, and will come out with the recommendations shortly in 7-10 days,"" Mr. Raghunandan said. TRAI's views on spectrum pricing and other nuances are crucial as it will set the pace for the auctions and subsequent rollout of the fifth-generation services that will usher in ultra-high-speed and spawn new-age services and business models. The telecom industry was expecting the regulator's recommendations to come by March-end. The telecom regulator, in November-end last year, had released a detailed consultation paper to discuss threadbare the modalities for auction of spectrum across multiple bands, including pricing, quantum and other conditions — preparing the groundwork for upcoming 5G auctions. Trai's comprehensive consultation paper runs into 207 pages and throws up 74 questions for industry-wide discussion, touching on crucial aspects like valuation and reserve price of 5G spectrum, quantum of the spectrum, block size, eligibility conditions for participation in the auction, roll-out obligations, spectrum cap, and surrender of the spectrum. Norms will also be worked out for new frequencies such as 526-698 MHz and millimetre band that is 24.25 - 28.5 GHz, in addition to bands like 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz, 2500 MHz, and 3300-3670 MHz. The last round of spectrum auctions, held in March 2021, had raked-in winning bids of over ₹77,800 crore for 855.6 MHz of spectrum. But, almost 63% of the total spectrum remained unsold. As the country gears up for the mega auction, the industry players have been making an aggressive pitch for lowering spectrum pricing. Telecom operator Bharti Airtel's Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Randeep Sekhon had recently made an emphatic appeal for ""affordable"" pricing of 5G radiowaves, saying pricing ""will play a very important role"". ""If operators are made to buy very expensive spectrum, naturally their cash flows will be limited, they will have to pay. But if it is very reasonable, then it is very possible that the operator will bring the same money on increasing footprint faster,"" Mr. Sekhon had said last week.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/regulators-5g-recommendations-in-7-10-days-work-in-final-stages-trai-secretary/article65271072.ece

121,"March 29, 2022",14:14 IST,business,economy,ICRA cuts 2022-23 GDP growth forecast to 7.2% from 8%," Rating agency ICRA has slashed its 2022-23 growth forecast for India’s GDP to 7.2% from 8%, citing elevated commodity prices and supply chain challenges arising from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, as well as higher prices of fuels and edible oils denting demand due to squeezed household incomes.  The agency expects growth this year to be 8.5%, lower than the official advance estimate from the National Statistical Office of 8.9%, it said in a note on Tuesday. Protracted geopolitical tensions, the renewed lockdowns in parts of China and high commodity prices pose downside risks to the growth outlook, ICRA warned, with firms facing compressed margins that could hurt the growth of gross value added (GVA) in the economy.    “Moreover, the K-shaped recovery appears likely to continue with the formal sector gaining market share in the coming year,” said ICRA chief economist Aditi Nayar, adding that higher prices of fuels and items such as edible oils are likely to compress disposable incomes in the mid to lower income segments, constraining the demand revival in 2022-23.  While the extension of free foodgrains under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana (PMGKAY) until September 2022 may offer some respite to the food budgets of vulnerable households, Ms. Nayar said ‘behaviour normalisation’ in the mid- to upper-income segments could drive consumption of contact-intensive services that were avoided during the COVID-19 pandemic so far. This, she said, could further constrain the demand for goods in the coming year.  Private investment revival may get delayed due to these headwinds, as capacity utilisation in industry is likely to reach only about 74%-75% by the third quarter of 2022-23, from around 71%-72% in the current January to March quarter.  “In ICRA’s view, utilisation would need to cross 75% for broad-based capacity expansion to be undertaken by the private sector. The most recent data released by the central bank pegs the capacity utilisation at 68.3% for the second quarter of 2021-22,” ICRA noted. As of now, a few sectors like cement, steel and those covered under the production-linked Incentive scheme are seeing fresh capacity building.  While the early data for March 2022 is mixed, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the associated surge in commodity prices has heightened uncertainty, and the expected margin compression is likely to squeeze GVA growth. ICRA expects real GDP growth to moderate to 3%-4% in the current quarter, from 5.4% in the previous quarter. An 8.5% GDP growth this year will mark a ‘mild rise of 1.3%’ relative to pre-pandemic levels, the agency said.  An early kick-off of the government’s budgeted capex programme remains crucial to boost investment activity in the first half of the coming year, the agency said. “However, a concern is that the execution risk is shifting to the States, with a considerable portion of the step-up in the Centre’s budgeted capital spending coming through the enlargement in the size of interest-free capex loan to the State governments to ₹1 lakh crore in 2022-23 from ₹15,000 crore this year,” it said.

The AAI estimated that a total of 19.9 crore passengers for this fiscal. Its forecast indicates that the traffic could be almost at pre-pandemic levels by the end of FY23 and reach 33.8 crore - 99.1% of FY20 passenger numbers. From March 27, India has also removed restrictions on international flights, allowing airlines to plan pre-pandemic level of flight operations. This information was provided by Minister of State for Civil Aviation V.K. Singh in Rajya Sabha. According to the AAI, various Indian airports could see passenger numbers rise to 44.8 crore by FY25 as compared to 34.1 crore in FY20. Estimates by rating agency ICRA indicated total (international and domestic) passenger traffic may rise 68-70% to 31.7-32 crore by the end of FY23. While domestic passenger traffic is expected to reach pre-pandemic levels in the next fiscal after growing 64-66%, international traffic will expand 100-105% but reach pre-Covid levels only by 2024, provided the impact of future Covid waves is low, ICRA said. “While operating profitability is expected to improve sequentially in FY2023 to 29-30% from 18-19% in FY2022, it is still likely to remain lower than pre-Covid level of 40% with full recovery likely in FY2024 only,” said Rajeshwar Burla, group head, Corporate Ratings, ICRA.  Minister Singh also told Parliament that almost 19,200 people employed in airlines, airports, ground-handling companies and air cargo companies lost jobs during the pandemic; this accounted for 10% of the total 1.9 lakh jobs in these sectors.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/aai-estimates-full-passenger-recovery-by-end-of-fy23/article65268155.ece

125,"March 28, 2022",00:15 IST,business,economy,A surprising budget in Tamil Nadu," A tweet by Tamil playwright and public intellectual Indira Parthasarathy on Tamil Nadu’s budget and the way it went viral symbolises the public perception of the budget by and large. Professor Parthasarathy, not known for making comments often on political events, called the budget “nuanced, broad-based and people-oriented”. But what was more surprising, to critics and supporters of the ruling DMK alike, was the budget itself, the regime’s first budget for a full financial year (2022-23). The supporters were surprised by the absence of any dramatic announcement of freebies. There was no word on the restoration of the old pension scheme for government staff, which was promised by the ruling party during the 2021 Assembly elections. The critics were surprised as the DMK, which rode back to power in 2006 on the assurances of free distribution of colour TV sets and cooking gas stoves, was showing an inclination towards the rationalisation of subsidy distribution.  The budget sends a clear message that the government is conscious of the challenges that lie ahead. The impact of the Russia-Ukraine war, the expected rise in inflation and interest rates, the COVID-19 pandemic, uncertainty over the continuation of compensation to States for the implementation of GST and the probability of monetary loss, and the absorption of entire losses of the perennially loss-making power utility, the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation, from 2022-23 all find a mention in the Budget. Keeping these factors in view, the government conservatively estimates only 17% growth for the next year with regard to the State’s Own Tax Revenue (SOTR), which accounts for 60% of its total revenue receipts. However, it has projected a growth rate of nearly 25% for 2023-24. Interestingly, since 2006, the SOTR growth rate breached the 20% mark only twice.  However, the government is bullish about the progress on the fiscal front in two years in the backdrop of what it has ‘achieved’ in the current year. As stated by Finance Minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan in his budget speech, this year there will be “a reduction in the absolute level of the Revenue Deficit by over ₹7,000 crore [vis-à-vis the previous year, a COVID-19 year], reversing an alarming trend of increasing deficits every year” since 2013-14. The government is upbeat about realising substantial gains in cost savings through measures including the data purity project, which is expected to weed out ineligible persons from the purview of welfare schemes.  This year’s budget is noteworthy for more reasons. It is seeking to refashion the existing marriage assistance schemes into one of promoting higher education for girls by paying ₹1,000 a month directly into their bank accounts provided they have studied from Classes 6 to 12 in government schools and joined undergraduate degree, diploma and ITI courses. The candidate will get the assistance till the completion of her courses without any break. Increasingly, the emphasis of the government is on ensuring that its welfare schemes reach only genuine beneficiaries. This DMK regime is seeking to mark a shift in the approach of the party towards subsidies, as universal application of subsidies had all along been the cry of the DMK and also of the AIADMK.  To give the much-needed push to the construction industry, the government has decided to raise the existing Floor Space Index in areas adjoining the alignments of metro rail, suburban rail, national highways and bypasses. Landowners have demanded a similar measure along the East Coast Road too. What is to be seen is how long the DMK regime is able to hold on to its position firmly on fiscal consolidation, without compromising on the concept of welfarism. ramakrishnan.t@thehindu.co.in",T.

126,"March 28, 2022",00:12 IST,business,economy,The era of an unemployed India," Reports on and the visuals of the recent agitations by railway job applicants reveal a widespread problem of massive job insecurity among India’s youth. Alarming figures of unemployment have been recurrent even before the huge dislocation unleashed by lockdowns imposed in 2020-21 in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Much before the pandemic, the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) reported a 6.1% unemployment rate in 2017-18, the worst in over four decades. The picture has proved more dismal in the ensuing months since April-May of 2020. For instance, in December 2021, the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) estimated that nearly 53 million Indians were unemployed, a large proportion of whom were women. The unemployment rate was hovering at 7.91% in December 2021, and though there has been some talk of a dip in unemployment in January 2022, the figure still stands at a worrying 6.57%.  Percentages and data spun out by governmental agencies and policy think-tanks are open to contestation, but there are other indices of proof that seriously contradict the tall claims of employment generation. One such index is the downward pressure unleashed by the influx of overqualified youth aspiring for middle and lower rung government jobs, which, despite their modest pay, are highly coveted given the greater job security ascribed to them. Expectedly then, having advertised over 35,000 posts, the Railway Recruitment Board was swamped with over 1.25 crore applications; a significant proportion of which were postgraduate degree holders. This created massive insecurity among a section of candidates who met the minimum eligibility but were being forced to compete with candidates having higher educational credentials. With government jobs being limited, and reducing in number due to the contractualisation and outsourcing of several substantative posts, intense competition persists across various categories of jobs; a point brought to light yet again by the recent Railways’ recruitment controversy. As clarified by the Railway Recruitment Board and Union Railway Minister, for the second stage of testing that stoked protests, the huge number of aspirants for the lowest right up to the highest level of jobs advertised, eventually compelled the authorities to shortlist 20 times the number of candidates for all levels. Shockingly, advertisements for even a handful of lower rung government jobs attract an overwhelming number of applications, leading at times to the withdrawal of such advertisements. In September 2021, news reports highlighted that among 18,000 applicants for some 42 posts (peon, gardener and cook) in the Himachal Pradesh secretariat, there were hundreds of doctorate and other postgraduate applicants. Earlier, in March 2021, more than 27,000 candidates with degrees such as BA, BSc, MA, MSc, MCom, MBA, engineering, etc. had applied for 13 positions for a peon’s job in the Panipat district court. Likewise, for 62 posts of messengers in the Uttar Pradesh police, in August 2018, there were a total of 93,000 applicants; 3,700 were PhD holders and 50,000 were graduates. This particular job vacancy required an education level of Class V and the selection criterion comprised a self-declaration that the candidate knew how to ride a bicycle. The desperate scramble for government jobs stems in no uncertain terms from the high job insecurity (easy hire and fire), poor basic pay, and long hours of work that characterise the bulk of jobs in the private sector. Historically, only a small number of employer-employee work relations in India — associated mostly with the formal sector — have been subject to state regulation. However, in recent decades, there has been a steady decline of state regulation of labour-capital relations in the formal sector. This deregulation has been coupled with a concerted push toward rapid privatisation of the public sector. Together, these developments have contributed significantly to periodic unemployment among both skilled and less skilled workforces, in addition to reducing avenues of gainful employment for new entrants in the job market. The ramifications of this overall process are multifold. At one level, enhanced deregulation of employer-employee work relations in the formal sector has triggered periodic unemployment of higher skilled workers, who have been spilling over into and crowding lower-skilled, informal sector jobs. Likewise, the spillover effect of periodic unemployment within middle-rung and higher-rung professional jobs in India’s job market has pushed more qualified youth to crowd lower rung government jobs.  This tendency itself has rendered a deep crisis for those with lower educational qualifications who strive for the more modest government jobs, and for whom such employment has traditionally been envisaged. Reduced expenditure by the state on health, education and the social sector as a whole has also ensured inadequate employment generation, despite the fact that the demand for ‘public goods’ has been growing exponentially. For a country with growing educational needs, especially with large numbers seeking to escape inherited poverty through avenues opened up by education, the marked shortage of government schools and public-funded universities is alarming to say the least. A closer look at the higher education sector itself reveals a steady increase in the number of student applicants. The scenario naturally calls for many more job recruitments of qualified teachers through the creation of new public-funded Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) and an expansion of existing ones. However, successive governments continue to restrict and even delay recruitment of teachers to existing public-funded HEIs. For example, in a large public-funded university such as the University of Delhi, a recruitment crisis has intensified over the years with over 4,500 teaching posts being filled by ad hoc teachers and appointments to permanent positions being stalled repeatedly.  This recruitment crisis is also the result of an inexplicable delay in the grant of the second tranche of teaching positions that was to accompany institutional expansion in the wake of implementation of reservations for Other Backward Classes (OBCs). A recipe for a complete disaster continues to unfold in such universities as a large, highly skilled workforce of serving teachers defensively holds on to insecure temporary job contracts as more eligible fresh candidates enter the job market. One of the contentious consequences of such heightened competition has been the enforcement of higher and higher qualifications for entry-level teaching jobs in public-funded HEIs. In this way, another index of mounting job insecurity and unemployment is the arbitrary enhancement of educational qualifications stipulated for recruitment into better-paid government jobs, as well as new criteria for admission into professional training institutions. This tendency has not only manifested itself in public-funded HEIs wherein entry-level teaching positions now mandatorily require a PhD degree in addition to a Master’s degree and UGC-NET qualification. It is also evident in the barrage of common entrance tests for highly sought-after educational degrees such as in medicine (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test, or NEET), as well as centralised eligibility tests for recruitment into jobs such as school teaching (Central Teacher Eligibility Test, or CTET). As the number of seats and vacancies fail to be augmented, we see a systematic effort to ruthlessly eliminate a growing number of aspirants using astute tests and arbitrary criteria. In the backdrop of a large number of skilled and overqualified people languishing in the throes of unemployment, the shrill rhetoric of ‘Skill India’ rings hollow. We will see more instances of frustration and agitations by the youth in response to rampant unemployment. For the scores of educated aspiring youth, transcending the prevailing logic of the economy is a crucial starting point for envisaging a world free of unemployment. An economy that creates fewer jobs is one which overworks some while rendering large numbers unemployed. A tired India and an unemployed India are simply two sides to the same coin. The youth need to realise that their fulfilment of dignified employment cannot happen in isolation but is linked to how the sea of highly exploited labouring masses around them are also guaranteed their access to the basics — education, health and livelihood. A transformation of circumstances awaits newer sensibilities and a sense of solidarities.

127,"March 28, 2022",00:08 IST,business,economy,Poverty rose but income inequality fell," COVID-19 has upended Indian society. Over two-thirds of the country has been infected by COVID-19 and perhaps five million or so people have died, directly or indirectly, from the pandemic. The economy too has taken a beating. Even though there has been a V-shaped recovery, output remains about 10% lower than 2019. In macroeconomic crises, including the oil shock of 1990-91 or the global liquidity crisis of 2007-08, many expect the poor to bear the brunt of the pain. They are the most vulnerable, without contractual protections and adequate safety nets. But there are signs that this pandemic has not followed that script. Poverty certainly rose during the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined monthly data from nearly 2,00,000 households with a total of one million members from the Consumer Pyramids Household Survey through 2021.  We found that extreme poverty, defined by the World Bank as the percentage of the population with an income below $1.90, rose from 7.6% in November 2019 to 11.7% in July 2021. However, income inequality actually fell. In 2019, the average monthly income of households in the top 25% and bottom 25% of the income distribution was approximately ₹45,000 and ₹8,000, respectively, in urban areas, and ₹22,500 and ₹7,500, respectively, in rural areas. While the average monthly income of the top quartile in urban areas fell almost 30%, to ₹32,500 by July 2021, the monthly income of the bottom quartile in July 2021 remained at pre-pandemic levels. In rural areas, the top quartile income fell by perhaps 20%, while the bottom quartile income grew slightly during the same period. The result is that inequality, measured as the percentage change in the income of the top quartile minus the income in the bottom quartile, fell by 15-20 percentage points. This is a robust finding: richer households saw larger drops in income all along the income scale, in rural and urban areas, within each State, and even within caste groups. This remarkable finding is not unprecedented. Historians observed the same dynamic during the plague in 14th century Europe. Given how much the world economy has changed since then, however, the explanations for India’s experience will differ. To learn why inequality fell during the pandemic, we examined three sources of household income: government transfers, business profits, and labour income. Government transfers are cash or in-kind payments. Profits may be from any business, be it a food cart, a farm, or a manufacturing plant. Labour income is wages earned from hourly work or employment contracts. Government payments to the poor cannot explain the decline in inequality. To be sure, income support was not insubstantial. Households received roughly ₹400 per month in urban areas and nearly ₹500 per month in rural areas during the lockdown and the Delta wave. They received roughly half that much during the rest of the pandemic. However, even when government transfers were netted out from income, income inequality fell by over 20% points by July 2021. Business profits play a bigger role than transfers. The rich saw a larger decline in business income and depended more on that income than the poor. While just 7% of a bottom quartile household’s income is from a business, nearly 15% of a top quartile’s household’s income is from a business. Unlike labour income, business income is volatile because it is susceptible to changes in demand, and thus to aggregate income. We find that business income of the top quartile is four times more sensitive to the aggregate performance of the economy than the business income of the bottom quartile. Given the large negative effect of COVID-19 on the economy, this suggests that some of the disproportionate losses of the rich operate through business income. Labour income, however, plays a critical role (Table). Labour income is just over 65% and 80% of the income of the top 25% and bottom 25% of households. These are larger shares than those of government transfers or business profits. To explain the decline in labour income, we looked at supply-side and then demand-side explanations. Looking at supply, one might suspect the rich chose to work less than the poor, perhaps out of fear of contracting COVID-19. That was also our conjecture, but it proved wrong. When the economy contracted, people lost jobs and income. They tried to compensate by finding alternate work, sometimes even in other occupations. While this seems a natural response for the bottom 25%, it was even more true for the top 25%. While the minimum amount that the poor were willing to accept to take a job fell roughly 40%, the minimum amount fell more than 45% for the rich. The better explanation for the disproportionate loss of labour income among the top quartile households is that demand for their labour fell more. The rich tend to work in the service sector, and demand for services fell more than demand for other sectors. While 30% of workers in bottom quartile households work in the service sector, 45% of workers from the top quartile households do. During the pandemic, consumer spending on services fell by 30%-40%, far more than the decline in spending on manufacturing or agriculture. The situation was reversed in manufacturing. That sector employs a larger share of bottom quartile workers than top quartile ones: 35% versus 15%. But manufacturing declined less than 20% during the pandemic. The progressive contraction of demand for services swamped the regressive contraction of demand for manufacturing. To be clear, our analysis does not suggest that the pandemic was good for the Indian economy. The loss of life and rise in poverty make it one of the larger disasters the country has borne. The reduction in inequality would be a silver lining if it were accomplished by lowering poverty rather than reducing the income of the rich. Nevertheless, by understanding the decline in inequality during the pandemic we can assess prospects for inequality after it ends. Once demand for services rises, along with aggregate income, both demand for the labour of the rich and the business income of that group will likely return.

128,"March 27, 2022",08:11 IST,business,economy,"Petrol price hiked 50 paise, diesel up 55 paise"," Petrol price on Sunday was hiked by 50 paise a litre and diesel by 55 paise, taking the total increase in rates since resumption of daily price revision less than a week back to ₹3.70-3.75 per litre. Petrol in Delhi will now cost ₹99.11 per litre as against ₹98.61 previously while diesel rates have gone up from ₹89.87 per litre to ₹90.42, according to a price notification of State fuel retailers. Rates have been increased across the country and vary from State to State depending upon the incidence of local taxation. This is the fifth increase in prices since the ending of a four-and-half-month long hiatus in rate revision on March 22. On all the previous four occasions, prices had been increased by 80 paise a litre—the steepest single-day rise since the daily price revision was introduced in June 2017. In all, petrol prices have gone up by ₹3.70 per litre and diesel by ₹3.75 in six days. Prices had been on a freeze since November 4 ahead of the assembly elections in States like Uttar Pradesh and Punjab—a period during which the cost of raw material (crude oil) soared by about $30 per barrel. The rate revision was expected soon after counting of votes on March 10 but it was put off by a couple of weeks apparently to not give opposition leaders like Rahul Gandhi a handle to say that they had rightly predicted that prices will go up after elections. Congress and other opposition parties have criticised the government for the price rise saying it has added to the burden on common man reeling under general commodity price rise. The increase in retail price warranted from crude oil prices rising during the 137 day hiatus from around $82 per barrel to $120 is huge but State-owned fuel retailers Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) are passing on the required increase in stages. Moody's Investors Services last week stated that state retailers together lost around $2.25 billion (₹19,000 crore) in revenue for keeping petrol and diesel prices on hold during the election period. Oil companies ""will need to raise diesel prices by Rs 13.1-24.9 per litre and Rs 10.6-22.3 a litre on gasoline (petrol) at an underlying crude price of USD 100-120 per barrel,"" according to Kotak Institutional Equities. CRISIL Research said a ₹9-12 per litre increase in retail price will be required for a full pass-through of an average $100 per barrel crude oil and ₹15-20 a litre hike if the average crude oil price rises to $110-120. India is 85% dependent on imports for meeting its oil needs and so retail rates adjust accordingly to the global movement.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/petrol-price-hiked-50-paise-diesel-up-55-paise/article65264330.ece
129,"March 26, 2022",21:02 IST,business,economy,Congress launches agitation against fuel hike,"  The Congress on Saturday announced a three-phased campaign, “Mehngai-Mukt Bharat Abhiyaan”, against price rise under which it will organise rallies and marches across the country from March 31 to April 7. The announcement was made after Congress President Sonia Gandhi’s meeting with party general secretaries and State in-charges where the party reviewed its membership drive and also discussed the programmes for ahead especially after its recent dismal performance in five Assembly elections. The party is demanding a roll back of the hike in prices of fuel and cooking gas.  Addressing a press briefing, Party General Secretary (Communications) said that people of India have been betrayed, duped and deceived by Modi government. “For 137 days the government kept the price of petrol, diesel, LPG cylinder, piped natural gas and CNG unchanged to secure votes in the five Assembly elections. And now that the elections are over, the government is slowly increasing the prices every day,” Mr. Surjewala said. In last five days, the prices of petrol and diesel have gone up by ₹3.20 per litre. Mr. Surjewala pointed out that in the last eight years, the BJP government has increased the excise duty on petrol by an additional ₹18.70 per litre and on diesel by an additional ₹18.34 per litre. He also hit out at the ruling government for drastically reducing subsidy. Quoting statistics of Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC) he said that the Congress led UPA government in 2011-12 gave a subsidy of ₹1,42,000 crore on petrol, diesel and LPG.  This amount has come down to ₹11,729 crores in 2020-21. The three-phase agitation will begin on 31st March. The party has told its workers to protest outside their homes and public places. He said people will garland LPG cylinders, beat drums and ring bells to highlight the issue of inflation and seek to draw the attention of the “deaf BJP government against the insurmountable increase in the prices of cooking gas, petrol and diesel. From April 2 to April 4, the Congress, along with NGOs, religious, social organisations and resident welfare bodies, will organise dharnas and marches at the district level across the country, he said. On April 7, the party will organise “Mehngai-Mukt Bharat” dharnas and marches at all State headquarters with the help of social and religious organisations, NGOs and people, Mr. Surjewala said.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/congress-launches-agitation-against-fuel-hike/article65262237.ece

Maize prices had gone up by more than 50% in the last six months, while the price of soya had increased from ₹35-40 a kg to ₹65-₹70 in the past one year. Maize and soya are the two main ingredients of poultry feed, which constitutes almost 80% of the cost of broiler chicken production.  “The poultry sector [broiler birds] sees almost 8% growth year-on-year. However, this year, with a sharp rise in the feed cost, broiler producers are unable to pass on the entire cost to the consumers,” he said.  Prices of maize and soya may come down when supply increases, which is usually in October-November, he added.  The broiler sector requires nearly 120 lakh tonnes of maize and 60 lakh tonnes of soya annually, said R. Lakshmanan, chairman, Broiler Coordination Committee, Tamil Nadu.  During the current financial year, the production cost ranged from ₹75-95 a kg, while the average farmgate price was ₹90 a kg.

131,"March 26, 2022",20:09 IST,business,economy,PSU disinvestment: Sebi proposes relaxing open offer norms," Markets watchdog SEBI has proposed changes to the mechanism for determining open offer price with respect to disinvestment of public sector undertakings. Issuing a consultation paper on review of the determination of offer price in case of disinvestment of public sector undertakings (PSUs), the regulator said the move is aimed at relaxing certain provisions, including doing away with the requirement of taking into account 60 days' volume-weighted average market price for calculating the offer price. Comments from the public have been sought on the consultation paper till April 15. The proposal to amend the provisions also come against the backdrop of the government planning to sell stakes in more companies. Noting that strategic disinvestment of PSUs is at variance with privately executed agreements, SEBI said the announcement of private transactions is made only upon execution of binding agreements and thus there is not much impact on the traded price of such target companies. In the case of PSUs' strategic disinvestment, ""Information comes in the public domain at the time of Cabinet approval and subsequent announcements are also made at different stages and thus the market price of the PSU concerned gets highly susceptible to such developments"", it noted. For such stake sales, the acquirer will be identified only after the shortlisting of bidders, which may be months or years late since the date when the information was first in the public domain. As a result, ""the prospective acquirer shall be chasing a moving open offer price as the market price tends to rise pursuant to announcement of the divestment and various stages thereafter and thus its liability for open offer obligations may constantly increase till the execution of agreement of the PSU with the acquirer,"" the regulator said in the consultation paper. Now, the regulator has proposed that ""in case of disinvestment of PSU companies, the requirement of 60 days' volume-weighted average market price-based parameter for calculation of offer price, may be dispensed with"". In case such PSU companies have stakes in other companies and due to such disinvestments an indirect acquisition is triggered, the requirement of 60 days' volume-weighted average market price-based parameter can also be dispensed with, as per SEBI. ""The acquirer shall disclose upfront the negotiated price for both direct acquisition as well for indirect acquisition,"" it added.

Stressing that it was focused on deepening digital payments, the RBI said it was committed to helping ensure inclusive access to all citizens at a time when the payments ecosystem in India had witnessed rapid developments with a bouquet of payment systems, platforms, products and services available for consumers. “To achieve this objective, it is imperative that robust payment acceptance infrastructure is available and accessible across the length and breadth of the country. Geo-tagging of payment system touch points will enable  proper monitoring of availability of payment acceptance infrastructure like Points of Sale (PoS) terminals, Quick Response (QR) codes. “In turn, such monitoring will  support policy intervention to optimise distribution of payment infrastructure,” the RBI said. Capturing the accurate location of existing payment system touch points / acceptance infrastructure (hereinafter referred to as payment touch points), was essential to upscaling and chalking out intervention strategies. This requirement could be effectively facilitated by geo-tagging of payment touch points, the RBI said. Geo-tagging refers to capturing the geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) of payment touch points deployed by merchants to receive payments from their customers. It has various benefits, such as, providing insights on regional penetration of digital payments; monitoring infrastructure density across different locations; identifying scope for deploying additional payment touch points; and facilitating focused digital literacy programmes. Policy interventions for realising the above benefits would be facilitated by the information thus collected, the RBI added.",The Hindu Bureau,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/rbi-sets-framework-for-geo-tagging-of-payment-system-operators/article65259582.ece
135,"March 25, 2022",19:14 IST,business,economy,Lok Sabha passes Finance Bill 2022; FM blames Russia-Ukraine conflict for rising fuel prices," Finance Minister Nirmala Sithararaman, responding to the debate on the Finance Bill, 2022, cleared by the Lok Sabha on Friday, blamed the Russia-Ukraine conflict for rising fuel prices and asserted that the government was committed to reducing the burden on the common man.  To counter Opposition criticism on high inflation and the lack of any tax relief for the middle class in the Budget for 2022-23, Ms. Sitharaman recalled a speech by India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru blaming the Korean war amid soaring food prices in 1951, and late PM Indira Gandhi’s decision to sharply raise income tax rates in 1970. Unlike many developed nations, India had not raised taxes to finance the pandemic spending and the economy’s recovery, she said.  The passage of the Bill, with 39 amendments including clarificatory points regarding the taxation of virtual digital assets and the disallowance of cess and surcharges as a business expense, paves the way for the government to implement the provisions of the Union Budget from April 1.  Noting that the Finance Bill highlights how the government, under the leadership of the Prime Minister, took a ‘conscious decision’ not to raise taxes during the pandemic or to finance the recovery from it. Citing an OECD report, Ms. Sitharaman said at least 32 countries, including Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Russia and Canada, increased various tax rates during the COVID-19 pandemic while India did not.  “The guidance I received while preparing last year’s Budget and this year was that we shall not take the taxation route. As a result, this Finance Bill has been received as one of the boring and insipid ones, with nothing great about it. But it is indeed, I would think, a Budget that did not burden the common man, yet put the money where the multiplier would be maximum and there would be infrastructure creation of assets with a big-time increase in spending,” she said.  On MPs’ comments about corporates getting lower tax rates, Ms. Sitharaman said the rate cuts announced in September 2019 actually helped the economy, the government and the companies.  “In the year 2018-19, our corporate tax collection was only about Rs. 6.6 lakh crore, then COVID happened… In spite of that reduction and the COVID impact, we have already collected corporate tax of Rs 7.3 lakh crore till yesterday, so the reduction in corporate tax has given us the rewards in spite of the intervening year being COVID-hit,” she explained, adding that improving corporate health could also lead to greater employment.   Reacting to criticism about the fuel price hikes effected since this Tuesday, Ms. Sitharaman attributed to the global situation arising from the Russia-Ukraine war. “...It has nothing to do with the election time. If the oil marketing companies think that they are procuring on a 15 days average at a higher rate, obviously we will have to bear [it]. And this war that is happening in Ukraine, the impact of that is on all countries, supply chains are disrupted, particularly on crude oil and so on,” she explained.  “In 1951, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru could say that a Korean war would affect Indian inflation… Korea and US could be used to justify price rise when India was not globally connected, but if genuinely today, we say the Ukraine war is causing the price rise, it’s not acceptable,” she said, terming this a ‘double standard’.  Recalling Mr. Nehru’s exact words from a speech, she said: ‘Prices keep going up, food prices rise, rationing and other steps had to be taken and you had to face difficulties. You complained and you must. We are in such a world that a war took place in Korea and prices of item go up here. If something happens in US, that affects prices here.’  “We as a government strongly believed in lowering prices, lessening the burden of the common man and we are continuously successfully doing it. Just to compare what prevailed earlier and today, on February 28, 1970, the Union Budget speech by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi who was also the Finance Minister at the time, had increased the marginal tax rate by 11 percentage points to 93.5% on all income over Rs 2 lakh,” she added.  “Today, if we do 1% TDS (Tax Deduction at Source) , we are being mocked and hit at. Now the highest tax slab for those earning over Rs 10 lakh is just 30%. Tax is a matter in which the Congress party never thought of reducing the common man's burden, whereas we are constantly working to make sure that people are not burdened, and we give them maximum benefit,” Ms. Sitharaman said.  “People who run businesses are treated with pride so that they can create jobs. We don't treat them as people from whom we have to suck out everything so that we have the vicarious pleasure of killing their entire business,” she underlined.   Reacting to MPs’ remarks that the government was conveying mixed signals about the regulation of virtual digital currency, Ms. Sitharaman said: “There is no confusing signal. We are very clear. There are consultations going on as to whether we should regulate it very much or a little or totally ban it. After the consultations will be concluded, the matter will come out. But till then, we are taxing it also because a lot of transactions are happening and this is commonplace knowledge based on members’ comments.”  Stressing that the TDS provisions for virtual digital assets did not constitute a new tax, she said it was useful for tracking purposes.  “(TDS) is one of the reasons that India’s tax base has been widening. We had about 5-odd crore taxpayers in 2014, which is now touching 9.1 crore because we are able to track the money trail of people who seem to be spending money but don’t pay when they are expected to pay taxes,” the minister said, noting that this also reflects the results of the battle against black money in the economy.  The discussion on the Bill took place by deferring the time usually allotted for private members’ bills in the House and Ms. Sitharaman explained that this was necessitated as this is the last week of March and ideally, ministries should be able to receive their funds by April 1 so that the planned spending can begin soon.",The Hindu Bureau,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/lok-sabha-passes-finance-bill-2022/article65259641.ece

CNG price in NCT of Delhi has been increased to ₹59.01 per kg from ₹58.01, according to the information posted on the website of Indraprastha Gas Ltd - the firm which retails CNG and piped cooking gas in the national capital.  This is the third increase in CNG rates this month, which follows a spike in input (natural gas) prices across the globe. On the previous two occasions, rates had gone up by ₹0.50 per kg.  Following the firming up of international gas rates, IGL has been raising CNG rates periodically. Prices have gone up by about ₹5.50 per kg this year alone.  Also, the price of piped natural gas that households get for cooking purposes has also been increased by ₹1 to ₹36.61 per standard cubic meter in Delhi.  The increase follows ₹1.60 per litre hike in petrol and diesel prices affected during the last two days and a ₹50 per cylinder raise in the cooking gas LPG rates.  After rising by 80 paise per litre on March 22 and 23, petrol and diesel prices remained unchanged on Thursday, possibly because of the heat the government faced on the issue in Parliament on the two previous days.  In Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad, CNG will cost ₹61.58 per kg and in Gurugram the price is at ₹67.37 per kg.  Similarly, PNG cost has increased to ₹35.86 per SCM in Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad and to ₹34.81 in Gurugram.  Prices vary from city to city depending on the incidence of local taxes such as VAT.  A record 137-day hiatus in petrol and diesel price revision ended on March 22, with an 80 paise per litre increase in rates and a similar proportion hike followed on Wednesday.  On March 22, the price of a 14.2-kg LPG cylinder was increased to ₹949.50 in the national capital. In some places, the LPG price has touched ₹1,000.

According to CRISIL Research, the price of crude oil (raw material for making petrol and diesel) has averaged $100 per barrel in the current quarter and a full pass-through would require a ₹9-12 per litre increase in the retail prices. And if the average crude oil price rises to $110-120, the hike required would be ₹15-20 per litre.  India is 85% dependent on imports for meeting its oil needs and so retail rates adjust accordingly to a global movement.

141,"March 24, 2022",10:30 IST,business,economy,Pure time preference theory," The pure time-preference theory of interest is an economic theory that seeks to explain the phenomenon of interest. American economist Frank Fetter was the best-known proponent of the pure time-preference theory in the 20th century through his 1904 book The Principles of Economics. There have been various theories that have been proposed throughout history, including the exploitation theory of interest, the productivity theory of interest, and the abstinence theory of interest, to explain why interest is charged when money, or any other good, is loaned out. The pure time-preference theory states that interest arises when present goods are exchanged for future goods because people, considering all other things being equal, prefer present goods over future goods. So, for example, an individual may prefer to have ₹100 in the present moment over the same ₹100 at some time in the future, ceteris paribus. So, unless an individual expects to receive an amount that is more than ₹100 rupees in the future, he would be reluctant to part with the ₹100 that is in his possession at the moment. Time preference refers to the relative importance that an individual places on the present versus the future. If an individual prefers immediate consumption over future consumption, he is said to possess high time-preference. On the other hand, if an individual prefers future consumption over immediate consumption, then he is said to possess low time-preference. A person with low time-preference is likely to save and invest money with an eye on the future while a person with high time-preference may be more likely to spend his money on immediate needs.  Proponents of the pure time-preference theory of interest disagree with both the productivity theory of interest and the abstinence theory of interest. The productivity theory of interest argues that interest arises because borrowers competing for loans are willing to pay additional money as interest. The assumption here is that borrowers expect to earn profits by investing the borrowed amount in some productive project and use some of the resulting profits to pay interest. The abstinence theory of interest, on the other hand, proposes that interest arises because lenders need to be enticed to postpone consumption to the future or they would not be willing to lend their money or goods. The pure time-preference theory also differs from the simple time-preference theory of interest which states that interest rates are determined by both the time preference of lenders and the productivity of capital. According to the simple time preference theory, the time-preference of lenders determines the minimum interest rate while competition between borrowers determines the actual interest rate. The pure time-preference theory of interest argues that interest rates are determined purely by the time-preference of lenders alone without any role being played by the productivity of capital. In this view, the owners of present goods or present capital play the role of buyers of future goods or future capital. Since people prefer present goods over future goods, they would be willing to exchange present goods for future goods only at a discount. So, for example, if a capitalist expects to receive ₹100 of cash flow from a business in a year, given that all other things being equal and since he prefers present goods over future goods, he would only be willing to invest an amount that is less than ₹100 in the business. It should be noted that, according to the pure-time preference theory, interest payment is not an enticement for capital owners to lend their money. Instead, owners of capital independently determine how much goods or capital they want to lend and the rate at which to discount future goods or capital.",Prashanth Perumal,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/pure-time-preference-theory/article65252082.ece
142,"March 24, 2022",00:16 IST,business,economy,"Global uncertainties, India’s growth prospects"," On February 28, 2022, the National Statistical Office (NSO) released India’s GDP data for Q3 of 2021-22 along with Second Advance Estimates (SAE) for 2021-22. Post COVID-19, the normalisation of the Indian economy has now been disturbed by the ongoing geopolitical uncertainties.  In the COVID-19 year of 2020-21, both real GDP and GVA contracted by minus 6.6% and minus 4.8%, respectively. The NSO’s SAE show that real GDP and GVA growth are estimated to recover to 8.9% and 8.3%, respectively, in 2021-22. Despite this improvement, the magnitude of real GDP at ₹147.7 lakh crore in 2021-22 is only marginally higher than the corresponding level of ₹145.2 lakh crore in 2019-20. The NSO’s GDP data highlights that in 2021-22, the nominal GDP growth at 19.4% is significantly higher than the real GDP growth due to an inordinately high implicit price deflator (IPD)-based inflation rate of 9.6%. Monetary policy authorities need to take note of this. The magnitudes of all demand components in 2021-22 have surpassed their corresponding levels in 2019-20. However, the growth of consumption and investment demand — as measured by private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) and gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) in 2021-22 over 2019-20 is only 1.2% and 2.6%, respectively, suggesting sluggish revival in domestic demand. On the output side, the 2021-22 magnitude of the trade, transport et.al sector, which has many contact-intensive segments, has remained below its corresponding level in 2019-20 by ₹2.9 lakh crore. Growth in the construction sector in 2021-22 was at only 1.9% over 2019-20.  On a quarterly basis, both GDP and GVA show normalising growth with waning base effects. Real GDP growth moderated from 20.3% in Q1 to 5.4% in Q3 of 2021-22. Similarly, real GVA growth also fell from 18.4% to 4.7% over this period. The implied Q4 GDP and GVA growth rates are estimated to be even lower at 4.8% and 4.1%, respectively. Thus, without a base effect, quarterly growth performance appears to be averaging at less than 5%. Assuming some base effects to continue in the first two quarters, the annual growth in 2022-23 may not be more than 7%. Even this may not be realised due to the ongoing geopolitical conflict. It is difficult to arrive at precise estimates of the impact of the increase in global crude prices, but some idea can be provided using the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)’s recent estimates (2021) of the growth and inflation effects of an increase of U.S.$10/bbl., ceteris paribus. The estimated impact is a reduction in real GDP growth by 27 basis points and an increase in CPI inflation by 40 basis points. This is based on using the baseline global crude price level of U.S.$75/bbl. For the full year of 2022-23, we may consider an average global crude price of U.S.$100/bbl. as a benchmark, although in the short run, it has already surged to U.S.$123.21/bbl. (average Brent crude price for the week ending March 7, 2022). An increase of U.S.$25/bbl. from the baseline price of U.S.$75/bbl. would lead to an estimated reduction in growth of 0.7% points and an increase in inflation of nearly 1% point. With reference to baseline growth for 2022-23 at 7% and CPI inflation at 5%, the revised levels of these may be put at 6.3% and 6%, respectively, due to the impact of crude price upsurge by an assumed margin of U.S.$25/bbl. through the year. The impact would be much larger if the margin of increase is enhanced. If the prices of other imported commodities also increase, the inflation impact will be higher. In regard to fiscal implications, reference may be made to the budgeted nominal GDP growth forecast for 2022-23 at 11.1%. Assuming a revised real growth component of 6.3% and an IPD-based inflation component of 6.5%, which may be slightly higher than the corresponding CPI inflation, we may have a revised nominal GDP growth close to 13.0%. Applying on this, a tax buoyancy of 1, the resultant Centre’s gross tax revenues (GTR) would be higher than the budgeted magnitude of ₹27.6 lakh crore by a margin of about ₹3.2 lakh crore. Alongside, there would also be increases in some components of expenditures linked to prices of petroleum products, including petroleum and fertilizer subsidies. The Government should attempt to keep the fiscal deficit at the budgeted level. Other economic challenges emanating from global uncertainties may include a worsening of the current account balance due to higher import bills with a depreciating rupee. A study by the RBI in 2019 had estimated an increase in the current account deficit (CAD) following a U.S.$10/bbl. increase in global crude price, to be nearly 0.4% points of GDP. Thus, for an increase of U.S.$25/bbl. in global crude prices, the CAD may increase by 1% point of GDP. The RBI Professional Forecasters Survey’s median estimate of CAD at 1.9% of GDP for 2022-23 may have to be revised upwards to 2.9%. There would also be some sectoral supply-side bottlenecks and cost escalation. Sectors that draw heavily on petroleum products, such as fertilizers, iron and steel foundries, transportation, construction and coal, would be adversely affected. Due to the discontinuation of transactions through SWIFT, there would be some disruption in trade to and from Russia and Ukraine. However, the respective shares of imports and exports from these countries relative to India’s overall imports and exports are limited. There would also be some adverse effects with regard to financial flows. Net foreign portfolio investment (FPI) outflows during October to December 2021 increased to U.S.$6.3 billion. Net foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows have also been falling during this period although they have remained positive.  Policymakers may have to exercise a critical choice regarding who bears the burden of higher prices of petroleum products in India among consumers and industrial users, oil marketing companies and the Government. If the oil marketing companies are not allowed to raise prices of petroleum products, the bill for oil sector-linked subsidies would go up. If the central and State governments reduce excise duty and value-added tax (VAT) on petroleum products, their tax revenues would be adversely affected. If, on the other hand, the burden of higher prices is largely passed on to the consumers and industrial users, the already weak investment and private consumption would suffer further. If growth is to be revived, maximum attention should be paid to supporting consumption growth and reducing the cost of industrial inputs with a view to improving capacity utilisation. The Government may have to strike an appropriate balance among these options. As developed countries are being forced to raise their interest rates and inflationary pressures continue to mount in India and abroad, the RBI may find it advisable to raise the policy rate with a view to stemming inflationary pressures and outward flow of the U.S. dollar even as the growth objective would be served by fiscal policy initiatives. C.

143,"March 23, 2022",21:09 IST,business,economy,Banks’ share in industrial credit plunged to 34% in FY21: BofA report," Domestic banks' share in the overall commercial credit plunged to a low of 34% in FY2021 from 56% in FY2011 partly due to the pandemic and more because companies were moving away from banks for funds, according to a report by BofA Global Research. The share of non-banks in commercial credit has more than doubled to 44% while that of foreign banks rose to 22% in FY21, taking total non-bank credit flow to two-thirds of the total, the brokerage highlighted in the report. Flow from domestic non-bank sources accounted for 44% of total credit to the commercial sector in FY21, more than doubling from FY11, it said. The agency included FDI, bank credit and IPO investments as part of foreign credit to the industry, which rose to 22% of the total flow in FY21 - which again doubled from FY11. The brokerage said it saw the metric in FY22 even as net FDI inflow tapers. The report further showed that non-bank credit to the commercial sector included disbursements by NBFCs and housing finance companies, LIC's net investment in corporate debt, CPs, public and rights issues and private placements by non-financial entities and credit lines offered by  NHB, Nabard and the like. Of the total non-bank source-based credit to the commercial sector in FY21, 38% was on account of gross private placement by non-financial entities and 22% was channelled via NBFCs. Commercial papers and corporate debt till January 2022 stood at ₹6.9 lakh crore, up from ₹8.4 lakh crore in the same period in FY21. Similarly, 22% of total credit to the commercial sector was channelled via foreign sources which include ECBs/FCCBs, short-term credit from abroad, FDI and ADR/GDR issues excluding banks and financial institutions, in FY21, when FDI alone touched a record ₹4 lakh crore. But so far this fiscal, FDI inflows have been slow. According to BofA analysts led by Aashta Gudwani, non-financial firms have been significantly lowering their reliance on bank credit to meet their funding needs for some time now leading to this massive decline and as a result non-bank domestic (like NBFCs and IPO) and foreign (FDI) sources have risen in prominence.  While bank credit flow tapered amidst the pandemic in FY21, non-bank credit stepped up sharply, so much so that even as bank-credit flow fell by 1.7% over FY20, there was an 18% increase in non-bank credit, resulting in a 10.4% growth in total flow of resources to the commercial sector, she said. Outstanding non-food credit growth moderated from an already low 6.1 per cent in March 2020 to 5.5 per cent in March 2021 as the pandemic shock hit the economy.  But with recovery underway, it has improved to 8 per cent as of February 2022. The flow of bank non-food credit fell by 3.4 per cent in FY21 but is up 17 per cent until February in FY22. On an annualised basis, total fund flow has grown 6 per cent so far this fiscal over FY21.  Bank credit so far has thus fared much better piggy riding the priority sector lending which rose to the highest at 59% of the total flow in the first three quarters of FY22, followed by personal loans (including home loans that grew 31%.  However, only 14% of bank credit flow was directed to industry, while bank credit to agri accounted for 18 per cent on the back of the ELCG scheme. This trend was also visible in FY21, when 44% of incremental bank credit was disbursed to the priority sector and only 6% went to industry. The brokerage also aimed to help correct the popular notion of credit disbursement being interchangeably used as bank credit (non-food bank credit in particular), saying the trend was true only until 2017, since then bank credit in total commercial credit has been declining, primarily after the RBI's asset quality review, and NBFCs quickly filled the gap. But this couldn't last long after IL&FS went belly up and then DHFL too went bankrupt in 2018. Sector-wise outstanding bank credit deployment too shows industry credit growing at a slow pace of 7.6% in December 2021. The credit to the services sector also grew by a low 10.8% but personal loan growth and farm credit growth were encouraging at 14.3% and 14.5% respectively.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/banks-share-in-industrial-credit-plunged-to-34-in-fy21-bofa-report/article65253265.ece
144,"March 23, 2022",19:53 IST,business,economy,Indians tighten belts as Ukraine war drives up prices of necessities," Many Indians are cutting down on fried food and even vegetables as the Ukraine war inflates the prices of items from edible oils to fuel, threatening a sputtering recovery in the consumption-based economy after two years battling COVID-19. Consumers in Asia's third-largest economy are feeling the bite as companies pass on a surge in costs since the invasion, battling the first hikes in five months this week in the prices of diesel and petrol, as well as more expensive vegetable oils. ""God only knows how we will manage this level of price rise,"" said Indrani Majumder, the sole earner in a family of four in the eastern city of Kolkata, adding that the past two years of the pandemic had brought a halving in salaries. These days her family eats more boiled food to save on the cost of edible oil, she said. It is just one of almost a dozen homes where people said they were taking similar steps. India's economy expanded at a pace slower than expected in the quarter from October to December, and economists forecast a further dent to growth in the current one, as high fuel prices bring a jump in inflation. Private consumption contributes the largest share of gross domestic output, at almost 60%. But since the invasion late in February, Indian firms have raised prices of milk, instant noodles, chicken and other key items by about 5% to 20%. About 800 million of a population of almost 1.4 billion received free government supplies of staple foods during the pandemic, and even small price rises now can mean a knock for their budgets. Families' finances could stay anaemic for the third year in a row, warned Pronab Sen, formerly India's chief statistician. ""The process of rebuilding savings was only beginning post the pandemic,"" he added. ""Because of this latest shock, they will have to cut back on consumption."" Surging global prices of crude have prompted companies in the import-dependent nation to raise retail prices of petrol and diesel twice this week. India imports 85% of its crude oil, which has seen prices rise almost 50% this year. The South Asian nation is also the world's biggest importer of edible oil, shipping in nearly 60% of its needs. But the price of palm, the country's most widely consumed edible oil, has jumped 45% this year. And supplies of sunflower oil, which Ukraine and Russia produce in large quantities, have been disrupted. Some wholesalers said their sales of edible oil had fallen by a quarter in the past month as prices rose. These factors helped keep India's retail inflation in February above the central bank's comfort level of 6% for the second month in a row, while the wholesale rate was more than 13%. ""The timing of input price inflation could not have been worse in the context of a slowing consumption trend,"" financial services firm Jefferies said in a note. The central bank has said it is monitoring crude and commodity prices ahead of its next monetary policy meeting in early April. But markets do not expect the Reserve Bank of India to change key rates, as it looks to prioritise growth. This stance compares with global central banks, which have either raised rates or are weighing whether to do so to curb inflation. For instance, policymakers of the U.S. Federal Reserve called this week for big rate increases in May. For consumers, there is little relief in sight. The Confederation of All India Traders estimates input costs for makers of consumer durables and fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) to rise another 10% to 15% this month as fuel prices rise, an expense destined to be passed on to the final consumer. In Kolkata, vegetable vendor Debashis Dhara said higher transport costs would bump up vegetable prices by a further 5% this week. His sales have already halved since February. India's Mother Dairy and Amul raised milk prices by nearly 5% this month, while FMCG companies such as Hindustan Unilever and Nestle are charging more for items such as instant noodles, tea and coffee. Broiler chicken prices have jumped nearly 45% in six months to a record ₹145 a kg this week, as key feed ingredients corn and soymeal have become costlier after supplies from the Black Sea region were affected. Fertiliser prices have shot up to a record $150 a tonne since Russia, one of the biggest producers, rolled tanks and soldiers into Ukraine. ""It has become very difficult to manage our monthly budget,"" said Archana Pawar, a housewife in the financial capital of Mumbai. ""This kind of price rise is forcing us to cut down consumption.""",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/indians-tighten-belts-as-ukraine-war-drives-up-prices-of-necessities/article65252834.ece

148,"March 23, 2022",04:17 IST,business,economy,"No illegality in floating LIC IPO through Money Bill, says Madras High Court"," There is no constitutional illegality in Parliament having amended the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) Act of 1956 by way of a ‘Money Bill’ for floating an Initial Public Offering (IPO) and parting with its shareholding in the corporation to raise ₹65,000 crore to ₹70,000 crore initially to the Consolidated Fund of India, the Madras High Court has ruled. The First Division Bench of Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice D. Bharatha Chakravarthy held that a challenge to the Finance Act of 2021, through which the LIC Act was amended, could not be accepted in the absence of a challenge to a certificate issued by the Lok Sabha Speaker classifying the Finance Bill 2021 as a Money Bill. The judges said, the Speaker’s decision should be treated as final as per Article 110(3) of the Constitution, unless a judicial review of it had been prayed for. They dismissed a writ petition filed by an insurance policyholder L. Ponnammal who had contended that the subject matter would not fall within the definition of Money Bill. The Bench pointed out that Article 109 lays down special procedures in respect of Money Bills. Such Bills could be introduced only in the Lok Sabha and not in the Rajya Sabha. After the Lok Sabha passes them, they should be transmitted to the Rajya Sabha for the latter to make its recommendations within 14 days. If the recommendations were not made within 14 days, the Bill should be deemed to have been passed by both the Houses and if any recommendations were made, the Lok Sabha could take a call on accepting or rejecting the recommendations. After such decision, the Bill would be deemed to have been passed by both the Houses. Issues related to payment or withdrawal of money either from the Consolidated Fund or Contingency Fund of India would fall under the definition of Money Bill and if any question arises as to whether a Bill was a Money Bill or not, the decision of the Lok Sabha Speaker would be final as per Article 110(3) of the Constitution. The present case is not one where an allegation of constitutional fraud has been made. “Even otherwise, we do not find constitutional bar or illegality in the Act of 2021. It is more so when the Parliament, endowed with plenary powers, had passed the Bill and the Standing Committee on budget had approved it after scrutiny and due diligence,” the Bench said. It concurred with the submissions of Additional Solicitor General N. Venkataraman that the prime purpose of the law was to receive money in the Consolidated Fund and use it for the development of the country and therefore the Act of 2021 would squarely fall within the realm of Money Bill. Authoring the verdict for the Bench, the Chief Justice wrote: “In any case, the petitioner, who is a policyholder having a policy worth ₹50,000 is questioning the receipt of money approximately in the range of ₹65,000 crore to 70,000 crore into the Consolidated Fund of India on account of the IPO.”  He went on to state: “The intrusion or inference to the implementation of a public interest policy by way of legislation should be eschewed as it directly impacts the economic growth of the country and interference therein may have far reaching consequences because the money is to be used for the development of the country.”",Mohamed Imranullah S.,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/no-illegality-in-floating-lic-ipo-through-money-bill-says-madras-high-court/article65249094.ece
149,"March 22, 2022",23:23 IST,business,economy,Steep fuel price hikes spark uproar in Parliament," After a four and a half month freeze on fuel prices in the run up to five State Assembly elections, India’s oil marketing companies began recovering the higher crude oil costs that have prevailed in recent months on Tuesday, with an 80 paise increase per litre in retail prices for petrol and diesel, along with a ₹50 increase in domestic cooking gas prices.  Both Houses of Parliament were disrupted with Opposition members demanding a rollback of the increases and walking out from the Lok Sabha. Rajya Sabha proceedings were marred by protests by members who also trooped into the well of the House, demanding a discussion on the issue.  Late on Tuesday, Reuters reported that Indian Oil Corporation had notified its dealers of a second consecutive increase of ₹0.80 in the prices of petrol and diesel that would take effect on Wednesday. From Wednesday, a litre of petrol in Delhi will cost ₹97.01, while diesel prices will be raised to ₹88.27, Reuters cited a notification sent to dealers as showing. Economists expect the gradual fuel price increases to add up to anywhere between ₹9 to ₹12 per litre of diesel and petrol, which could go up to as much as ₹20 a litre if the average global crude oil price rises to $110-120.  Such hikes would undo the excise duty cuts announced by the government in early November 2021 and push retail prices past the ₹100 per litre mark for both fuels. The price hikes are expected to feed into retail inflation that has already been over the 6% mark in the past two months, pinching households and denting consumption further.  Petrol and diesel prices were last revised in November 2021, though crude oil prices surged by nearly $30 a barrel since then, soaring even higher than $100 a barrel, following the invasion of Ukraine by Russia. Domestic cooking gas prices have been unchanged since October 2021.  After the initial price increase on Tuesday, petrol in Delhi will cost ₹96.21 per litre as against ₹95.41 previously while diesel rates have gone up from ₹86.67 per litre to ₹87.47. The price of a non-subsidised LPG cylinder has been increased to ₹949.50 for each 14.2-kg bottle in Delhi.  Earlier this week, the price of bulk diesel was hiked by ₹25 per litre, while Aviation Turbine Fuel prices were raised last Wednesday by a record 18%, taking them past the ₹1 lakh per kilo litre mark.  Taking a dig at the government on Twitter, former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi said, “The lockdown on the prices on gas, diesel and petrol has ended. Now, the government will continuously ‘develop’ the prices. If you ask the Prime Minister about the epidemic of inflation, he will say #Thaalibajao”  Dipti Deshpande, principal economist at rating agency CRISIL said the pass-through of rising crude oil prices to domestic fuel prices is ‘inevitable and further hikes can also be expected’ with the impact expected to show up largely in the April inflation data.  “While lower excise duty relative to last year will help moderate the impact of rising international crude oil prices, it will not be sufficient to lower fuel inflation if Brent prices stay above $90 per barrel throughout next fiscal. In that case, the government may need to cut excise duties further to alleviate the burden on consumers,” she said.  The diesel price hikes will have the highest impact, said Gaurav Moda, partner and energy leader at EY India, as they account for over 50% of transportation fuel in the country. “The rise in logistics cost will have a near direct inflationary pressure across most of the goods we consume,” he noted, adding that LPG prices will hurt the unsubsidised industrial commercial segment.  “Given that the price of crude oil has averaged ~$100 per barrel in the current quarter, a full passthrough would require a ₹9-12 per litre increase in the retail prices of petrol and diesel. And if the average crude oil price rises to $110-120, the hike required would be ₹15-20 per litre,” Hetal Gandhi, director of Crisil Research, estimated.  In the Lok Sabha, Opposition MPs demanded a reversal of the fuel price hikes and staged a walkout. Soon after the Question Hour, Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the latest hike was on expected lines as the Opposition parties had predicted that prices of diesel and petrol would increase after the Assembly election.  DMK’s T.R. Baalu and Trinamool Congress leader Sudeep Bandopadhyaya too joined in the protest against the fuel price hike and urged the government to rollback.  Rajya Sabha witnessed two adjournments on Tuesday as Opposition members protested against the fuel price rise. The Upper House could function only for a total of 14 minutes in the first half as Opposition members trooped into the well demanding a discussion on the issue.  Earlier when the House proceedings began at 11 a.m., Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu said that a notice under Rule 267 (suspension of business of the day to discuss the stated matter) was not permitted.  “There was a notice under Rule 267 by Shaktisinh Gohil, Dola Sen, Dr. Sivadasan, Elamaram Kareem and John Brittas about the prices of cooking gas, petroleum and diesel. This is not admitted,” Mr. Naidu said.  This led to vociferous protests and the House was adjourned til 12 noon. When the House resumed, the members continued to protest. Deputy Chair Harivansh requested the members to go back to their seats.  “This is the Question Hour and as you know a lot of money is spent to prepare for this hour, I request the members to go back to their seats,” Mr. Harivansh said.

Conceding the need to reduce the delays, G.P.

But in a phased manner, nine months or seven months, we will improve this in the near future,” Mr. Samanta told the panel, noting that timeliness was as critical as the quality of data to ensure its utility as a policy tool.   “We can just reduce the nine months’ lag to at least four or five months in the beginning. Then... in the long run, align it with the GDP frequency, it will be good enough,” he added. As of now, the PLFS data had been released till March 2021, and data for the next quarter was expected in 15 days, Mr. Samanta said.  Responding to MPs’ queries about the global benchmark and whether it takes a year for the employment data to be released, the Secretary said: “Definitely not.

Even before Russia launched its invasion on February 24, energy markets had little spare capacity, and will struggle to absorb the potential loss of about 2 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil from Russia that competes with Saudi Arabia as the world's top oil exporter. ""The longer the war goes on, the greater the chance of an economic recession,"" Vitol CEO Russell Hardy told the FT Commodities Global Summit. He said customers had told Vitol they did not want Russian crude and the trading firm has stopped spot purchases of Russian oil, although it has maintained existing longer-term contracts. ""Many people across Europe wish to boycott Russian flows... How that transpires into how much oil is lost, is still relatively unknown,"" Mr. Hardy said. ""We think 2-3 million bpd of Russian oil could be lost but a lot depends on Asia's reaction."" Any replacement oil is likely to be months away. Iran could increase exports by 1 million bpd provided a nuclear deal is signed, but the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies were unlikely to increase output faster, he said. ""They've been fairly clear up till now that they will continue with their OPEC+ agreement,"" Mr. Hardy said, adding African countries in particular had less oil to spare than before the pandemic. ""Are we expecting a 1-2 mln bpd increase? Yes but not likely in next couple of months,"" he said. The futures markets, for natural gas in particular, have become more prone to volatility as strained credit lines force market participants to cut positions. ""Gas markets are even more concerning than oil. It's important for regulators to have the tools in their back pocket in case there is disorder in the gas market,"" Mr. Hardy said, pointing to extreme jumps in benchmark European wholesale gas futures.

This is starting to feel like an inflation regime-change moment,” said Brian Coulton, Chief Economist, Fitch Ratings.  The rating firm also scaled up its inflation forecast for India. “Local fuel prices have been flat over the past weeks, but we assume that oil companies will eventually pass on higher oil prices to retail fuel prices (with some offset from a reduction in the excise duty by the government),” it noted.  “We now see inflation strengthening further, peaking above 7% in 3Q22, before gradually easing. We expect inflation to remain elevated throughout the forecast horizon, at 6.1% annual average in 2021 and 5% in 2022,” the agency said.  Noting that India’s GDP growth has been very strong in the September to December quarter of 2021, Fitch also raised its growth projection for 2021-22 to 8.7% from 8.1% earlier.  “Indian GDP is more than 6% above its pre-pandemic level, though it is still well below its implied pre-pandemic trend,” Fitch said in its Global Economic Outlook report, where it has pared its world GDP growth forecast for 2022 to 3.5% from 4.2%.  Emphasising that India’s monetary policy normalisation has been shallow till now, with the central bank prioritising the economic recovery over tackling inflation ‘amid a still-large output gap’, Fitch said it still expects the repo rate to rise to 4.75% by this December, from the present 4% level.  “The reverse repo rate – which has become the effective driver of money market rates since the start of the pandemic – is likely to be increased by a larger amount,” the agency said. ",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/fitch-cuts-india-growth-forecast-for-2022-23-to-85-from-103/article65248507.ece

In remarks at the National Association of Business Economists, Mr. Powell said the Fed would raise its benchmark short-term interest rate by a half-point at multiple Fed meetings, if necessary, to slow inflation. The Fed hasn’t raised its benchmark rate by a half-point since May 2000. On Wednesday, the central bank announced a quarter-point rate hike, its first interest rate increase since 2018. Stocks rallied after the announcement and went on to have their best week in more than a year. The central bank is expected to raise rates several more times this year. Before Russia's invasion of Ukraine added a new wave of global economic uncertainty to the mix, some Fed officials had said the central bank would do better to begin raising rates by a half-point in March. Given rising risks of a recession, Clifford Bennett, chief economist at ACY Securities, said he believes the Fed should act cautiously.  “Europe will likely enter recession and with the world experiencing ongoing high energy and food prices, the poor will be disproportionately impacted. And raising interest rates will have zero impact on this war-driven inflation wave,” he said.  This week, there isn't much U. S. economic data to give investors a better sense of how companies and investors are dealing with rising inflation. The Fed's move to raise interest rates had been expected for months as supply chain.  Russia's invasion of Ukraine has added to concerns that inflation could worsen by pushing energy and commodity prices higher. Oil prices are up more than 45% this year and prices for wheat and corn have also surged. Boeing fell 3.6% after a 737-800 aircraft operated by China Eastern Airlines crashed in China with 132 people on board. Reports on Tuesday said there were no survivors. China Eastern's shares sank 7% on Tuesday. In currency trading, the U. S. dollar surged to six-year highs against the Japanese yen, hitting 120 yen-levels. It was trading at 120.35 yen by midafternoon, up from 119.47 yen. The euro cost $1.0991, down from $1.1016.

157,"March 22, 2022",09:37 IST,business,economy,"Petrol, diesel price hiked 80 paise a litre; LPG up ₹50"," Petrol and diesel prices were on Tuesday hiked by 80 paise a litre while domestic cooking gas prices were increased by ₹50 per cylinder, ending an over four-and-half month election-related hiatus in rate revision, sources said. Petrol in Delhi will now cost ₹96.21 per litre as against ₹95.41 previously while diesel rates have gone up from ₹ 86.67 per litre to ₹87.47. Simultaneously, the price of a non-subsidised LPG cylinder has been increased to ₹949.50 for each 14.2-kg bottle in the national capital. While LPG rates were last revised on October 6, 2021, petrol and diesel prices had been on a freeze since November 4 as five States including Uttar Pradesh and Punjab went to polls. LPG prices had gone up by close to ₹100 per cylinder between July and October 6, 2021, before criticism halted the revision in rates. Both LPG and auto fuel prices had been on a freeze since then despite the cost of raw material spiralling, first because of demand returning with economies globally rebounding from the pandemic induced slowdown and then due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Non-subsidised cooking gas is the one that consumers buy after exhausting their quota of 12 cylinders at subsidised or below-market rates. However, the government pays no subsidy on LPG in most cities and the price of the refill that consumers, including the poor women who got free connection under the much-talked Ujjwala scheme, is the same as non-subsidised or market price LPG. Sources said a 5-kg LPG cylinder will now cost ₹349 while the 10 kg composite bottle will come for ₹669. The 19-kg commercial cylinder now costs ₹2003.50. Since June 2017, petrol and prices are to be adjusted daily in line with the benchmark international rate in the preceding 15 days. But rates have been on the freeze since November 4, 2021, just after the Narendra Modi government cut excise duty on petrol by ₹5 per litre and that on diesel by ₹10 a litre to bring down rates from record-high levels. Most state governments too lowered local sales tax or VAT. Before these tax reductions, petrol price had touched an all-time high of ₹110.04 a litre and diesel came for ₹98.42. These rates corresponded to Brent soaring to a peak of $86.40 per barrel on October 26, 2021. Brent was at $ 82.74 on November 5, 2021, before it started to fall and touched $ 68.87 a barrel in December. International oil prices started rising again this year and jumped to a 13-year high of $140 per barrel earlier this month. Brent was trading at $118.59 per barrel on Tuesday. To compound things, the Indian rupee tumbled to a record low of ₹ 77 to a dollar. India relies on overseas purchases to meet about 85% of its oil requirement, making it one of the most vulnerable in Asia to higher oil prices. The twin blows of oil prices, already up more than 60%this year, and a weakening rupee may hurt the nation's finances, upend a nascent economic recovery and fire up inflation. Petrol and diesel prices need to be increased by up to ₹25 a litre for fuel retailers to cover the losses they incurred when they kept rates on hold despite a rise in the cost of raw material, industry sources said. Diesel sold to bulk and industrial consumers had already been raised by about ₹25 per litre, indicating that is the gap between retail pump prices and their actual economic value. The basket of crude oil that India buys rose above $ 128.24 per barrel on March 9, according to information from the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC) of the oil ministry. This compares to an average of $ 81.5 per barrel price of the Indian basket of crude oil at the time of freezing of petrol and diesel prices four months ago. But oil companies are not expected to pass on the entire loss in one go and they will moderate it —raising rates by less than a rupee a litre every day. International oil prices have been on the boil ever since Russia put its forces on the Ukraine border. They spiked after it invaded the eastern European nation on fears that oil and gas supplies from energy giant Russia could be disrupted, either by the conflict in Ukraine or retaliatory western sanctions. While Western sanctions have so far kept energy trade out, a prospect for a full embargo of Russian oil and products is leading to the latest rally in international oil prices.

Brent crude futures were up $6.52, or 6%, at $114.45 a barrel by 1442 GMT, adding to a 1.2% rise on Friday. Prices moved higher ahead of talks this week between European Union governments and U.S. President Joe Biden in a series of summits that aims to harden the West's response to Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. EU governments will consider whether to impose an oil embargo on Russia. Early on Monday, Ukraine's deputy prime minister Iryna Vershchuk said there was no chance the country's forces would surrender in the besieged eastern port city of Mariupol. ""Optimism is seeping away about progress in talks to achieve a ceasefire in Ukraine and that’s sent the price of oil on the march upwards,"" Susannah Streeter, senior markets analyst at U.K.-based asset manager Hargreaves Lansdown, said. With little sign of the conflict easing, the focus returned to whether the market would be able to replace Russian barrels hit by sanctions. ""With the possibility that more than a million barrels of Russian oil a day will be snubbed, given that the Netherlands and Germany combined received around a quarter of Russia's crude and light oil exports, demand would shoot up for crude supplies from OPEC+ nations."" Over the weekend, attacks by Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi group caused a temporary drop in output at a Saudi Aramco refinery joint venture in Yanbu, feeding concern in a jittery oil products market, where Russia is a major supplier and global inventories are at multi-year lows. The latest report from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia, together known as OPEC+, showed some producers are still falling short of their agreed supply quotas. Oil prices were also sensitive to talk of Hong Kong lifting COVID-19 restrictions, which could increase demand, and in response to the growing list of U.S. companies retreating from Russia - including Baker Hughes, ExxonMobil, Shell and BP.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/oil-prices-climb-more-than-6-as-eu-considers-russian-oil-ban/article65246819.ece
160,"March 21, 2022",21:03 IST,business,economy,India comfortably placed to deal with any effect of war: Das," With foreign exchange (forex) reserves of $677 billion, India is comfortably placed to deal with any effect of war [in Ukraine] or any challenges with regard to financing of the Current Account Deficit (CAD) is concerned, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das said on Monday. “The economy is better placed today,” Mr. Das said in an address to the National Council meeting of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) in Mumbai. “In external sector we are better placed but we are living in an uncertain world. So there is no reason for complacency. We have to be watchful and monitoring very closely,” he added. The RBI Governor said as per latest data India had forex reserves of $622 billion, while another $55 billion would be coming in shortly from the forward markets. Asserting that India was better placed than European economies in the backdrop of the war, Mr. Das said that high frequency indicators were broadly in the green and that, unlike the 2013 taper tantrum, in the run up to the current crisis the country’s CAD was “very low” and forex reserves were “very high”. “In the last three years our forex reserves have gone up by $270 billion,” he said. Highlighting that India was monitoring the crude and commodity prices and the volatility very closely, he expressed the hope that inflation would not cross 6% in FY23. “I am emphatically saying that while we are watchful and monitoring all the trends we stand committed and are confident of dealing with any emerging situation and dealing with any emerging challenges,” he stressed. “That is the level of commitment and confidence that is there in the RBI and like in the past we can do it in the future as well,” he added.  To a question on whether there was a risk of stagflation, Mr. Das asserted that India faced no such prospect.
“The RBI and the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) see no fear of stagflation in India,” Mr. Das said. He said despite the COVID crisis Indian banks were better placed than in the past. While their gross NPA level reached an all-time low of 6.5%, the system-wide capital adequacy ratio was at 16%, and the provision coverage ratio was 69%. He said under the current circumstances the RBI had gone beyond the rule book to support growth and recovery. “The RBI for the last two years has remained supportive of growth and we have resisted expectations and temptations of reversing our monetary policy and moving away from accommodative stance,” he added. Acknowledging the prevailing global uncertainties and also the fact that the primary responsibility of the RBI was to maintain price stability, Mr. Das said that though the current crisis in Europe could have an impact on inflation in India, the possibility of a prolonged breach of the laid down tolerance band was remote. On the exchange rate, he stated that the policy of the RBI has been to intervene only to address excessive volatility. The Indian rupee had deprecated only by 0.4% this fiscal till March 17 and given its reserves, RBI was confident of exchange rate stability. He also assured the gathering of industrialists of adequate liquidity to meet the credit needs of the economy.",The Hindu Bureau,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/india-comfortably-placed-to-deal-with-any-effect-of-war-das/article65246503.ece

163,"March 20, 2022",14:15 IST,business,economy,Diesel price for bulk users hiked ₹25/litre; private retailers stare closure,"  The price of diesel sold to bulk users has been hiked by about ₹25 per litre in line with a near 40% rise in international oil prices, but retail rates at petrol pumps remain unchanged, sources said. Petrol pump sales have jumped by a fifth this month after bulk users like bus fleet operators and malls queued up at petrol bunks to buy fuel rather than the usual practice of ordering directly from oil companies, widening the losses of retailers. Worst hit are private retailers like Nayara Energy, Jio-bp and Shell, who have so far refused to curtail any volume despite a surge in sales. But now closure of pumps is a more viable solution than continuing to sell more fuel at rates that have been on freeze for a record 136 days, three sources with direct knowledge of the development said. In 2008, Reliance Industries had shut all of its 1,432 petrol pumps in the country after sales dropped to almost nil as it could not match the subsidized price offered by the public sector competition. A similar scenario may unfold again as retailers' losses widen from bulk users being diverted to petrol pumps, they said. Price of diesel sold to bulk users has been hiked to ₹122.05 per litre in Mumbai. This compares to ₹94.14 a litre price of the same fuel sold at petrol pumps. In Delhi, diesel costs ₹86.67 a litre at the petrol pump, but for bulk or industrial users it is priced at about ₹115. PSU oil companies have not raised retail prices of petrol and diesel since November 4, 2021, despite a surge in global oil and fuel prices, a move seen as aiding the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in crucial State assembly elections. Prices were supposed to start aligning with cost after counting of votes on March 10, but the ensuing start of the second half of the Budget Session meant that the price increases didn't happen. Private fuel retailers like Nayara Energy, Jio-bp and Shell were forced to hold petrol and diesel prices as they would have lost customers, if rates at their petrol pumps were higher than those of Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL). But now, the PSU retailers have hiked rates for bulk users such as state bus fleets and malls and airports which use diesel for generating back up electricity, sources said.  There is hardly any bulk or industrial user of petrol, diesel is widely used in industries. The wide difference of about ₹25 per litre between the bulk user rate and petrol pump price has prompted bulk users to refuel at petrol pumps rather than book tankers directly from oil companies, they said. This has led to widening losses of oil companies, who were already bleeding from selling petrol and diesel at way below the cost. While Nayara Energy did not reply to an email sent for comments, Jio-bp— the fuel retail joint venture of Reliance and U.K.’S bp retail and industrial price of diesel, leading to heavy diversion of bulk diesel (direct customers) to retail outlets.” “There is also a very heavy lifting of fuel by dealers and both B2B & B2C customers, who have advanced their purchases, to top up their tanks and capacities in anticipation of price increase which is overdue. Due to this immediate surge there have been record sales in March 2022, which is putting strain on the entire logistics and supply infrastructure,” Jio-bp spokesperson said.  This is further exacerbated by shortage of Tank Trucks and rakes due to sudden surge in demand along with limited availability of TT crew during the festive period across the industry, the spokesperson added.  While private retailers have not disclosed sales, PSU retailers have sold 3.53 million tonnes of diesel from March 1 to 15, up 32.8% from a month earlier. The sales were 23.7% higher year-on-year and 17.3 per cent higher than sales in March 1-15, 2019.  Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri last week said that fuel sales had jumped 20% due to hoarding in anticipation of price increase, but sources insisted the sales also increased because of bulk users queuing at petrol pumps.  A Jio-bp spokesperson said in spite of challenges, Reliance is fully committed to meet the demand of its retail customers.  While Nayara has 6,510 petrol pumps in the country, Jio-bp has 1,454. PSUs control 90% of the 81,699 petrol pumps in the country.  In 2008, PSU retailers were paid government subsidies for selling petrol and diesel at below cost but private retailers were kept out of such a scheme. This time around, PSU retailers have been asked to square up their losses from inventory gains and higher refining margins they are earning now. But private retailers do not have refineries to cover up for retail losses.

164,"March 20, 2022",01:01 IST,business,economy,Explained | Will the war in Ukraine rattle India’s banks?," The story so far: S&P Global earlier this week forecast that banks in India would face ‘headwinds’ as a fallout of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The rating agency flagged rising inflation and borrower ‘stress’ that could affect companies’ ability to fully pay back loans.  The war has impacted the production and movement of a wide range of raw materials and commodities. Ukraine, for instance, is the main source of sunflower oil imported into India. Supplies have naturally been hit and are bound to further push up the retail prices of edible oils.  The conflict has also forced Ukraine to shut two neon factories that account for about 50% of the global supply needed in the manufacture of semiconductors. As semiconductors become scarcer, user industries bear the brunt. Already, the global chip shortage has led to the waiting period for the delivery of new premium cars in India being extended to several months. And with major carmakers having reported declines in sales for January and February, the profit outlook for these companies and their component suppliers looks significantly clouded. The domino effect on the automobile and other industries' supply chains could impair the ability of businesses, especially medium and small enterprises, to fully service their loans.  Oil has been on the boil ever since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24. After zooming to $139 a barrel — near historical highs — Brent crude prices were at the $106 a barrel level as of Friday. With India’s state-run oil marketing companies certain to raise the retail prices of petrol and diesel sooner than later, the higher cost of transportation is bound to feed into the prices of goods from agricultural produce to raw materials for factories and to finished products headed to store shelves, thus quickening inflation across the board.  Higher input costs for manufacturers and service providers would leave them in a tough spot as they would have to choose between passing on the price increases to consumers — thus risking the already tenuous demand — and hurting their profitability if they opt to absorb the impact. Here again smaller businesses, that are most dependent on bank credit, are bound to be hit the hardest. If the war in Europe is prolonged, Indian banks could end up facing delays in the repayment of loans or possibly even having to write them off as ‘bad’.  Separately, with the dollar benefitting from a global flight to less risky assets, as well as the start of the U.S. Federal Reserve's calibrated monetary tightening to rein in inflation from a 40-year high in the world's largest economy, the rupee is expected to weaken against the U.S. currency. With the exchange rate impacted, importers would have to shell out more rupees for the same dollar value of imports than before. Unless demand expands, allowing them to sell more volume, a weaker local currency eats into their profits, leaving them with lesser cash available to service loans.  Official data for February show that overall goods imports are growing faster than exports compared with a year earlier, widening the current account deficit (CAD). Widening CAD is likely to cause the rupee to weaken further to 77.5 to a dollar by March 2023, from 75, Crisil Ratings said on March 17.  Rising inflation, which is already just beyond the RBI’s 6% upper tolerance limit, may nudge the central bank into raising benchmark interest rates. This means more interest will have to be paid by companies that would likely face the prospect of lesser profit.  Earlier this month, India Ratings said that the increase in commodity prices could result in a stretched working capital cycle for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), weakening their debt servicing ability.  India’s lenders had already been struggling to cope with an overhang of non-performing assets or bad loans even before the pandemic severely hurt overall economic momentum.  In its Financial Stability report for December 2021, the RBI warned that from a Gross Non-Performing Asset Ratio of 6.9% in September 2021, commercial banks were likely to see the metric rise to 8.1% in a baseline scenario, and possibly soar to 9.5% under a ‘severe stress’ situation by September 2022.

186,"April 03, 2022",23:15 IST,business,markets,Conflict adds lustre," Helped by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Comex gold posted its biggest quarterly gain since September 2020. The concerns on the rising U.S. inflation rate also played a role in bolstering sentiment. Comex gold gained 2.8% in March to close at $1,954 an ounce. Comex silver posted a slightly better performance, posting gains of 3.2% to settle at $25.13 an ounce. Mirroring the global trend, MCX gold futures gained 2.4% to close at ₹52,166 per 10 gm. MCX silver futures closed 2.4% higher at ₹67,487 per kg. Comex gold managed to move well beyond the second target of $2,025-2,030 mentioned last month. After moving to a high of $2,078.8 in early March, the gold price has cooled off and is confined to a trading range in the past few days. A breakout from this range would set the tone for the next move. A move past $1,970 could help Comex gold rise to $2,015-2,025. On the other hand, a fall below $1,855 would be a sign of weakness and could push the price down to major support at $1,835-1,840. Comex silver, too, ruled firm and reached the target of $27.75-28.8 mentioned last month. The short-term outlook depends on the price action in the near term. A move past the resistance level at $26.5 will be a sign of strength and the price could then head to the $27.50-28.50 zone. On the contrary, a drop below the support level at $23.8 would be a sign of weakness and the Comex silver price could then drop to the $21.5-22.5 zone. In sync with the international price, the MCX gold price, too, moved well past the target price of ₹53,500-54,500 mentioned last month. The short-term outlook is positive and a move to ₹54,100-54,600 appears likely. This view would be validated if the price moves past ₹52,400. A fall below ₹49,800 would invalidate the positive outlook. MCX silver, too, managed to hit the target zone of ₹68,500-70,100 mentioned last month. More recently, the silver price cooled off sharply in the domestic market. Only a close above ₹70,100 would reinstate positive momentum. Else, the price could either drift lower or remain confined in the range of ₹64,000-70,000. To summarise, precious metals are in a cool-off phase after a sharp rise in the early part of March. The short-term outlook depends on the breakout past the trigger levels mentioned above. It would be prudent to wait for the price to break out past these levels before making conclusions as to the direction of the next move. (The writer is a Chennai-based analyst / trader.

202,"March 27, 2022",21:58 IST,business,markets,The ‘untold’ market story," As the headlines bemoaned just a couple of weeks ago, the Nifty 50 crashed almost 5% in a day. There were several falls thereafter. If you were among the astute investors who thought this was a great buying opportunity, you would have stopped likely when you read the headline screaming a Nifty recovery. As it stands, the Nifty 50 is down roughly by 6.4% since its high in October 2021 (as of March 18). So, you may now think that the correction is either done, or that it hasn’t been deep enough to allow buying at cheap enough prices, going by the Nifty 50 returns. But did you know that the Nifty or the Sensex could mask performance in individual stocks and therefore does not entirely represent the correction in the stock market? Wider correction The full market capitalisation of the Nifty 50 is about 58% of the Nifty 500’s market capitalisation. The latter represents the whole market better than the 50-stock index. Therefore, though the Nifty 50 may be dominant, there’s plenty outside this 50-stock universe.  Remember that indices such as the Nifty or Sensex are market-cap weighted, which means rallying stocks receive more weight. Therefore, a few stocks can influence the index’s returns even as most other stocks perform differently. Consider the stocks in the Nifty 500 basket. Close to 60% of them have seen prices decline much more than the Nifty 50 since the October 2021 peak. The average decline in the stocks is a good 18% — much higher than the Nifty index’s correction of 6.4%. In other words, a majority of stocks in the market corrected more than the Nifty. You may not have looked for stock opportunities if you had only followed the Nifty level.  The bulk of these, of course, is in small-cap stocks. This is natural, as this market segment usually bears the brunt of corrections but then, this segment also sees far bigger rallies. But even apart from small-caps, there is a good smattering of stocks in the mid-cap and large-cap segments that have seen steep falls.  Consider the Nifty 100 index, for example, which houses the 100 largest stocks by market cap. Close to half the stocks in the index have seen steeper price dips than the Nifty 50, with the average decline coming in at 13%. So, opportunities to buy fundamentally sound stocks at better valuations, especially given the rapid rally over the past two years, are opening up.  Performance differentials Why does Nifty 50 not entirely reflect the real fall in individual stocks? This can be explained by a few factors: One, the index is weighted by market caps. The index’s return is therefore dependent on the performance of stocks with heavier index weights and this can be at odds with other stocks even within the index.  As we saw earlier in 2018 too, the top stock weights doing better than most can pull up the index’s returns even as other stocks languish. Over 2020 and 2021, stocks outside the index heavyweights climbed sharply bringing about a more broad-based rally. But now, with six out of the Nifty’s top 10 heaviest weights either gaining or staying flat in the past few months, the index as a whole has done better than individual stocks. Two, some sectors have suffered far more than others as is typical in any market cycle. The financial segment is one that has dropped heavily – and though the Nifty has a heavy banking sector weight, NBFC and other financial stocks that are not part of the index have also sunk. Similarly, other sectors that are not index-dominant but have seen selling include chemicals, pharma, auto and FMCGs. A third reason could be passive investment flows. As passive funds need to necessarily buy into stocks to reflect the index, index investing and rebalancing could shore up stocks within the index. Stocks outside indices, without this support, can thus fall much more. For example, the AUM of Nifty index funds and ETFs rose 3.5% between October 2021 and February 2022. The AUM of active equity funds, on the other hand, shrank by 2% in the same period. AMFI data shows that inflows into index funds and other ETFs (i.e., not gold) jumped 50% in February 2022 over the previous month, even as equity funds saw just a 2% rise.  The upshot of all this is that waiting for the Nifty or Sensex to showcase a correction before wading in may mean missed opportunities in your own portfolio. So how do you then stay alert and not be oblivious to individual stock corrections? Having a stock watch list can help here.  One, you can do your homework of filtering out stocks that are fundamentally strong and put them in your watch list if you find them expensive. You should do this on an ongoing basis and not when a correction starts. Corrections can give you the buying signal. Two, you can shortlist stocks from your existing portfolio if they are quality ones and provide an opportunity to average. This will also ensure you hold more of sound stocks, which will ultimately help build wealth. Such a watch list helps sharpen your focus when corrections begin, letting you buy into attractive valuations even though the main market indices are yet to correct.

203,"March 27, 2022",12:13 IST,business,markets,FPI outflow shoots past ₹1 lakh crore mark in 2022," Overseas investors have pulled out a net ₹1,14,855.97 crore from the Indian markets in the current year so far, amid heightened geopolitical tensions and inflation concerns. Foreign portfolio investors have sold domestic equities worth ₹48,261.65 crore so far this month, taking the year-to-date tally this year to a massive ₹1,14,855.97 crore, according to depositories data. The exodus of foreign investors was largely owing to inflationary pressures and deepening global macroeconomic conditions following the Russia-Ukraine war, experts said. This is for the sixth straight month that foreign institutional investors have offloaded their holdings on a net basis in the Indian equity market. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) fear that India would be impacted more by commodity price hikes, particularly in crude oil, since India is a major importer. ""While Russia- Ukraine war has limited the direct impact on the Indian economy, given our lower dependence of imports from these countries, higher commodities inflation poses a key risk both in terms of macro parameters such as the balance of payments and inflation as well as corporate earnings estimates on account of higher input costs,"" said Shibani Kurian, Senior EVP & Head- Equity Research, Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company. Ms. Kurian further added that India is a net importer of crude oil and it is estimated that every 10 per cent increase in crude oil prices impacts the current account deficit by around 30 bps and CPI inflation by around 40 bps and GDP by around 20 bps, all else remaining constant. ""However, unlike the past, this time around there are a few offsets from a domestic standpoint, which includes high forex reserves, strong FDI flows and improvement in export growth,"" Ms. Kurian noted. As per depositories data, foreign investors pulled out ₹28,526.30 crore from Indian equities in January, ₹38,068.02 crore in February and ₹48,261.65 crore in March so far. ""The Indian equity markets continue to be in a grind, influenced by and reacting to incremental news flow on the global front, especially related to the geopolitical situation and Fed rhetoric. The two key challenges and monitorables for the markets in the near term are the persistent inflationary pressures and the rising bond yields,"" said Milind Muchhala, Executive Director, Julius Baer. While the inflationary pressures have been building up over the past few months, the geopolitical situation has worsened the situation, as Ukraine and Russia are large players in the energy and several commodities, and the prices of several of these have spiked up since the beginning of the crisis, Mr. Muchhala added. ""A prolonged geopolitical situation and elevated prices will gradually start weighing on demand and profitability and can lead to a cut in growth and earnings estimates. Also, the recent rise in bond yields can have implications for flows and equity valuations,"" Mr. Muchhala said.

At the interbank forex market, the local unit opened at 76.15 against the greenback and witnessed an intra-day high of 76.12 and a low of 76.29.  The rupee settled at 76.24, registering a rise of 9 paise over its previous close of 76.33.  Meanwhile, the dollar index, which measures the greenback's strength against a basket of six currencies, fell 0.16% to 98.62.  The rupee rebounded amid dollar softness and lower crude oil prices but trimmed the early gains following weaker domestic equities and foreign fund outflows, said Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities.  Ahead of the financial year-end, the rupee tends to show a high swing on the back of rebalancing-related inflows and outflows, Mr. Parmar added.  ""The balance of risks for USDINR remains skewed to the upside following geopolitical worries and broad based selling by foreign institutions. Spot USDINR is expected to settle in the range of 76 to 76.50 this month, medium term direction remains bullish as long as it holds 75.70,"" Mr. Parmar noted.  Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, declined 1.27% to $117.52 per barrel.  According to Emkay Global Financial Services, geo-political tensions continued to dominate market sentiments this week.  ""The members of the G7 countries said that they are ready to apply additional sanctions as required and will spare no efforts to hold Putin and his supporters accountable. The US went ahead with imposing fresh sanctions on a dozen of Russian defence firms. Global markets are clearly worried that the sanctions will affect the economic recovery going forward,"" it said.  Crude oil prices have so far gained 10 per cent this week as European nations also mull sanctions on Russian oil and gas imports. US central bankers were very active this week as most of them were unanimous in their call for aggressive rate hikes this year to curb soaring inflation in the US.  ""Any further upside in crude oil prices next week will put the rupee under pressure. This will trigger a move towards 77/77.14 levels again. On the contrary, any positive developments in the talks between Russia and Ukraine will help the Rupee strengthen towards 75.77/75.50 levels,"" it added.  On a weekly basis, the rupee depreciated 40 paise against the American currency.  According to Sriram Iyer, Senior Research Analyst at Reliance Securities, the Indian rupee appreciated on Friday against the U.S. Dollar, tracking the fall of the oil prices and marginally weaker greenback.  However, the local unit ended weaker for the week largely due to the volatility in crude oil prices which dampened sentiment for risk assets in the region.  ""We might witness the Rupee appreciating further next week towards 76.00 levels as foreign-currency inflows are expected next week, which usually is seen at the end of the financial year,"" Mr. Iyer said.  However, investors will remain wary of the situation in Eastern Europe and escalation of tension there will push oil higher and in turn keep appreciating bias limited, Iyer added.",PTI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/rupee-advances-9-paise-to-close-at-7624-against-us-dollar-on-fall-in-crude-oil/article65259288.ece

European Union Foreign Ministers are split on whether to join the United States in banning Russian oil. Some countries, including Germany, say the bloc is too dependent on Russia's fossil fuels to withstand such a step. ""It is still not clear whether this will really happen,"" wrote Carsten Fritsch of Commerzbank in a report, adding: ""a decision of this kind requires unanimity.""

Oil was pressured by a stronger U.S. dollar, which gained after comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Monday that flagged a more aggressive tightening of monetary policy than previously anticipated. A strong dollar makes crude more expensive for other currency holders and tends to weigh on risk appetite. ""The word 'transitory' regarding inflation is a distant memory, chiefly due to rising commodity prices,"" said Tamas Varga of broker PVM. ""Central banks, led by the Federal Reserve, stand ready to increase the cost of borrowing significantly."" Brent hit $139 a barrel, the highest since 2008, earlier this month. Threats to supply from attacks by Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi group on Saudi energy and water desalination facilities added support. Saudi Arabia said on Monday it would not bear responsibility for any global supply shortages after the attacks by the Houthis, in a sign of growing Saudi frustration with Washington's handling of Yemen and Iran.

government removes bureaucratic hurdles and encourages investment in the sector, the World Gold Council (WGC) said in a report published on Thursday. The South Asian country is the world's second-biggest consumer of the metal and fulfils most of its demand through imports. Higher local output could help New Delhi in capping imports. India splurged a record $55.7 billion on gold imports in 2021, buying 1,050 tonnes - the most in a decade, and far more than the 430 tonnes imported in 2020. ""It makes sense for India to develop mining capacity. But change is needed for this to happen, legacy hurdles must be reduced considerably, and investments encouraged,"" said Somasundaram P.R., regional chief executive officer of WGC's Indian operations. In India, securing mining licence is a lengthy process with approvals needed from multiple agencies, which dissuades investment, particularly from multi-national companies, the council said. Most gold mining areas are in remote locations with poor road and rail linkage, which makes moving materials to and from sites difficult and expensive, it said in the report.

251,"April 06, 2022",18:09 IST,sci-tech,health,Centre denies presence of Omicron’s XE recombinant variant,"  The Union Health Ministry on Wednesday refuted claims that India has reported its first case of the COVID-19 variant, XE, in Mumbai. The rebuttal came shortly after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said that the results of the 11th batch of next generation genome sequencing conducted by it on 230 COVID-19 positive patients had found one case of Omicron’s new sub-variant, XE. The BMC noted that a 50-year-old female patient, a costume designer by profession and a member of a film shooting crew, who had arrived from South Africa on February 10, 2022, had tested positive for XE. The civic body added that she is double vaccinated, and she tested negative for COVID-19 on arrival in India, but on March 2, 2022, in routine testing conducted by Suburban Diagnostics, she was found to be positive and quarantined. The result of the test done on the following day was negative. According to the BMC, out of 230 COVID-19 patients tested, 228 were infected with the Omicron variant while one was infected by the Kappa variant. Of these, 21 had to be admitted to hospital. None of them was in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or needed oxygen support. A senior health official, however, maintained, “FactQ files in respect of the sample, which is being said to be the XE variant, were analysed in detail by genomic experts of the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG), who have inferred that the genomic constitution of this variant does not correlate with the genomic picture of the XE variant.’’ The BMC in its release said: “The patient’s lab sample has been referred to Kasturba Hospital Central laboratory for whole genome sequencing. It has been found to be a new XE variant in initial sequencing. Though GISAID also confirmed it, INSACOG has decided to go for another round of genomic sequencing at national laboratory for sure confirmation of XE variant.” “This lady is totally asymptomatic and found to be RT-PCR negative on repeat testing. XE, a new variant of COVID, is a combination of the BA.1 and BA.2 strains of Omicron and found to be responsible for enhanced viral transmission according to primary reports. Frequent changes in genomic structure are part of the natural life course of the viruses and there is no need to be scared but everyone should opt for appropriate precaution,” the BMC said. XE is a recombinant that’s a mutation of the BA.1 and BA.2 Omicron strains. Recombinant mutations emerge when a patient is infected by multiple variants of a virus, according to experts. INSACOG is the forum that was set up under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare by the Government of India on December 30, 2020 to monitor genome sequencing and virus variations of circulating strains of COVID-19 in India. The consortium ascertains the status of Variants of Interest (VoI) and Variants of Concern (VoC) in the country; establishes sentinel surveillance and surge surveillance mechanisms for early detection of genomic variants; and assists in formulating an effective public health response. It also determines the presence of genomic variants in samples collected during super-spreader events and in areas reporting increasing trend of cases/deaths etc. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned of the new subvariant XE, stating that it’s more transmissible than any strain of COVID-19. There are three hybrid or recombinant viruses in total that have been detected so far. These are XD, XE and XF, of which XD and XF are a combination of the Delta and Omicron variants. The XE variant is a hybrid of two versions of Omicron — BA.1 and BA.2. The new mutant XE emerged for the first time in mid-January this year. Britain’s health agency said on April 3 that XE was first detected on January 19, and 637 cases of the new variant have been reported in that country so far.

The WHO further added that the recombinant virus was detected in the U.K. on January 19 and over 600 sequences have been reported and confirmed since. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is an RNA virus which evolves by accumulating genetic errors in its genome. These errors are produced when the virus infects a person and makes copies of itself inside the host’s cells.  These errors (otherwise called mutations) are therefore a by-product of replication of SARS-CoV-2 inside the cell and may be carried forward as the virus continues to infect people. When viruses having a specific set of errors or mutations infect a number of people, this forms a cluster of infections descending from a common parental virus genome and is known as a lineage or a variant of the virus.  The PANGO network, an open global consortium of researchers from across the world, provides a system for naming different lineages of SARS-CoV-2. These variants or lineages are widely followed by epidemiologists for tracking the evolution of SARS-CoV-2. Apart from the errors in the virus genome, another process through which a virus increases its genetic diversity is recombination. Recombination occurs when, in extremely rare situations, two different lineages of the virus co-infect the same cell in the host and exchange fragments of their individual genomes which generates a descendent variant having mutations that occurred in both the original lineages of the virus. Recombination of lineages happens in a variety of other viruses, including those that cause influenza, as well as other coronaviruses.   Such recombination events occur typically in situations where two or more lineages of SARS-CoV-2 may be co-circulating in a certain region during the same time period. This co-circulation of lineages provides an opportunity for recombination to occur between these two lineages of SARS-CoV-2.  While recombination events are not frequently observed for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, multiple recombinant lineages have been designated during the pandemic. The recombinant lineages are annotated by PANGO with an ‘X’ followed by an alphabet which indicates the order of discovery. Some previously detected and designated lineages include XA, a recombinant of B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and B.1.177 detected in the U.K., lineage XB detected in the U.S., and lineage XC detected in Japan, which is a recombinant of B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and AY.29 sublineage of Delta. Three new recombinant lineages of SARS-CoV-2 have been recently designated by the PANGO network and are being monitored — XD, XE, and XF.  Lineages XD and XF are a combination of lineages AY.4 (a sublineage of Delta) and BA.1 (Omicron), while lineage XE is a combination of Omicron lineages BA.1 and BA.2. Lineage XD, which has the Spike gene of Omicron inserted into a Delta genome, was first detected in France and Denmark. Lineage XF was detected in the U.K. early in January 2022 but has since not shown any significant transmission events in the country. Lineage XE, also first detected in the U.K., is a recombinant having fragments of lineage BA.1 with the majority of BA.2 genome.  Although currently present in a very low proportion of genomes in the U.K., early data from the country show evidence of community transmission of XF.  Although recombination has been detected in SARS-CoV-2, it has not yet impacted public health in a unique way. There is little evidence to suggest that recombinant lineages have a varied clinical outcome compared to the currently dominant Omicron variant, although preliminary data from the U.K. health security agency suggests a transmission advantage over the Omicron variant. It is certain at this point in time that more data will be needed to ascertain the impact of these lineages on the epidemiology of COVID-19. Identifying and tracking recombinant lineages for SARS-CoV-2 is a challenging task. This would require specialised tools and the availability of primary (or raw) data for genome sequences as similar variant combinations could also arise from inadvertent errors in sequencing or analysis as well as contamination of sequencing experiments. A cluster of recombinant genomes can be designated a lineage name by the PANGO network if it can be confirmed that samples in the cluster have a common origin and descend from two individual lineages of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, there should be at least 5 genomes in the public domain belonging to the cluster, indicating an ongoing transmission of the lineage. Furthermore, screening the sequencing data of these samples should show no signs of contamination and meet the definition of a recombinant.  Since recombinations are extremely rare occurrences, it is unclear how and why the viruses recombine. It is, therefore, important to track recombination of SARS-CoV-2 lineages because it may lead to the generation of a viral lineage that is better at infecting people or transmitting from host to host. Regardless of the consequences that recombination events may have on the evolution of the virus, monitoring circulating SARS-CoV-2 genomes for evidence of recombination will not only help gain a better understanding of the ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 but will also be able to give one a heads up, if a more “concerning” variant of the virus were to emerge.

253,"April 04, 2022",20:44 IST,sci-tech,health,Biological E. to receive mRNA vaccine tech from WHO," Vaccine maker Biological E. has been selected to receive mRNA technology from the World Health Organization technology transfer hub.  After examining a number of proposals from India, the WHO's Advisory Committee on Vaccine Product Development has selected Biological E. as a recipient, the Hyderabad–based firm said on Monday.  Primarily set up to address the
Covid-19 emergency, WHO’s technology transfer hub has the potential to expand manufacturing capacity for other products as well, including treatments, and target other priorities such as malaria, HIV and cancer. WHO and partners will be working with the Indian government and Biological E to develop a roadmap and put in place training and support for the company to start producing mRNA vaccines as soon as possible, it said. “We are very pleased with the trust WHO places in our organisation... this is also a reflection of our world–class processes, scale and effectiveness,” BE Managing Director Mahima Datla said.  The company has been investing in mRNA technologies since last year and the partnership with WHO will enhance its ability to develop next generation mRNA vaccines that could be more suitable globally and expand the reach of vaccines availability worldwide, she said. One of the largest vaccine manufacturers, BE’s Corbevax, a recombinant protein subunit vaccine, is part of the national immunisation programme against
Covid-19. It was given emergency use authorisation for children aged 12-18 years and adults up to 80 years. WHO said the mRNA vaccines use a messenger RNA created in a laboratory to teach the human cells how to produce a protein that in turn initiates an immune response inside the body against a particular disease. The immune response will fight the actual virus as it gets into the body. At present, India has no COVID-19 vaccine made on mRNA platform.

255,"April 03, 2022",18:44 IST,sci-tech,health,First case of infection from diabetes medication in India," After the U.S. and Canada, India too has admitted incidence of a rare but serious infection of the genitals and area around the genitals among Type-2 diabetes patients using sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors . This serious rare infection, called necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum, is also referred to as Fournier’s gangrene. As a precautionary measure the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) has requested all State Drug Controllers to direct the manufacturers of SGLT2 inhibitor class drugs named Canagliflozin, Dapagliflozin, Empagliflozin, under their jurisdiction to include warnings in the package insert and promotional literature of these drugs. The Health Ministry, responding to a question on the adverse reaction to the anti-diabetes medicine by MP P. Velusamy, submitted the information recently. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors are recommended as preferred add-on oral anti-diabetic drugs (OADs) after metformin among type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure (HF), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). They are generally many times costlier than other OADs, note experts. The Ministry submitted in Parliament that CDSCO was notified about a Health Canada communication to all those authorised to market sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors regarding a summary safety review (SSR) on the potential risk of pancreas inflammation (acute and chronic). United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) in its drug safety communications (DSC) has cautioned about cases of rare but serious infection of the genitals and area around the genitals bring reported with use of SGLT2 inhibitors. “This serious rare infection, called necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum, is also referred to as Fournier’s gangrene. USFDA has revised the labels of SGLT 2 inhibitors to include new warnings about the risk to patients,’’ noted the Ministry. It added that the issue was examined in consultation with Subject Expert Committee (SEC) of CDSCO and information available under the Pharmacovigilance Programme of India (PvPI) has also been obtained. Diabetes is a chronic, metabolic disease characterized by elevated levels of blood glucose (or blood sugar), which leads over time to serious damage to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys and nerves. The most common is type-2 diabetes, usually in adults, which occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn’t make enough insulin. In the past three decades the prevalence of type-2 diabetes has risen dramatically in countries of all income levels, according to the World Health Organisation. Union Health Minister Dr. Mansukh Mandaviya had stated in Parliament that while the exact number of patients suffering from diabetes in India is not known, however, as per 10th edition of Diabetes Atlas 2021 of International Diabetes Federation (IDF), the estimated number of patients with diabetes between the age group of 20-79 years is 74.2 millions in year 2021 and it is estimated to be increased to 124.8 millions in year 2045.",Bindu Shajan Perappadan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/after-us-india-confirms-cases-of-infection-from-diabetes-medication/article65286868.ece

In a statement issued on April 1, Bharat Biotech said it was fully committed to implementing facility improvements and upgrades to ensure that the production of Covaxin meets all global regulatory requirements. “For the millions who have received Covaxin, the vaccine certificates issued still stand valid as there is no impact on efficacy and safety of the vaccine,” said the Company. It added that as a vaccine manufacturer safety is the primary consideration for any vaccine, and hence safety and efficacy will continue to be of paramount importance. Announcing a temporary slowing down of Covaxin production for facility optimisation, the company said for the coming period, the company will focus on pending facility maintenance, process and facility optimisation activities. While the company on Sunday said it did not have anything to add to the earlier statement, it said upgrades were due as all existing facilities were repurposed for the manufacture of Covaxin, with continuous production during the past year, to meet the public health emergency of COVID-19.  “Certain highly sophisticated equipment which were required to enhance the process stringency were unavailable during the COVID-19 pandemic. It has to be stressed that the quality of Covaxin was never compromised at any point in time,” the company noted. It further explained that during the recent WHO post Emergency Use Listing Procedure (EUL) inspection, Bharat Biotech agreed with the WHO team on the scope of the planned improvement activities and indicated that they will be executed as soon as practical.  The company was also pleased to learn from the WHO, that the necessary optimization work does not indicate a change in the risk-benefit ratio (for Covaxin) and the data, available to WHO, indicates the vaccine is effective and no safety concern exists”.  Bharat Biotech further explained that this risk assessment by the WHO is based on the supply of hundreds of millions of doses of Covaxin globally, during which the product has demonstrated an excellent safety and efficacy profile in detailed and thorough post marketing surveillance activities. As per the Company more than a million doses of Covaxin were introduced under clinical trial mode, where safety of subjects was actively documented. (With inputs from PTI)",Bindu Shajan Perappadan,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/who-suspends-covaxin-supply-to-un-agencies/article65286705.ece

The WHO, in its weekly epidemiological update, said the recombinant was detected in the United Kingdom on January 19 and over 600 sequences have been reported and confirmed since. It went on to add: “Early-day estimates indicate a community growth rate advantage of about 10% as compared to BA.2, however this finding requires further confirmation.” The U.K. Health Security Agency (UKHSA), which tracks SARS-CoV-2 variants, analysed three recombinants, known as XF, XE and XD. It explained that, of these, XD and XF are recombinants of Delta and Omicron BA.1, while XE is a recombinant of Omicron BA.1 and BA.2. A recombinant variant occurs when an individual becomes infected with two or more variants at the same time, leading to a mixing of genetic material in the human body. Several such recombinants have emerged in the past during the pandemic.  The UKHSA has stated that in the U.K., only 38 cases of XF have been identified, though none since mid-February. There is currently no evidence of community transmission within the U.K. XD has not been identified in the U.K. to date, though 49 cases have been reported to global databases. However, a total 637 cases of XE have been confirmed in the UK so far. “The earliest of these has a specimen date of 19 January 2022. There is currently insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about growth advantage or other properties of this variant,” the agency said. However, all the recombinants are being tracked closely, it added.  Reflecting this, the WHO also said that until there emerges further confirmation on the community growth rate, “XE continues to belong to the Omicron variant until significant differences in transmission and disease characteristics, including severity, may be reported.” It has also committed to closely monitoring and assessing the public health risk associated with the recombinant variants.",Special Correspondent ,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/who-records-new-recombinant-sars-cov-2-variant/article65284952.ece

India’s drug regulator had approved Covovax for restricted use in emergency situations in adults on December 28.  While more details on the move are awaited, Minister of State for Health Bharati Pravin Pawar, responding to a question by Rajya Sabha member Naranbhai J. Rathwa on price control of COVID vaccines Covaxin and Covishield, said these were two different types of vaccines and that their manufacturing processes were also different.  Submitting her response this week in the Upper House, the Minister said the price of vaccine for procurement by the Government of India was negotiated by the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NEGVAC) and its subgroups involving detailed deliberations with the vaccine manufacturers. Under the National COVID-19 Vaccination Programme, the vaccine was available free of cost at government COVID-19 Vaccination Centres (CVCs) to all eligible beneficiaries irrespective of their socio-economic status.  “The vaccine manufacturers are free to fix the price of vaccine for procurement by private hospitals, which has to be declared in a transparent manner. However, the Government of India has fixed a maximum service charge of ₹150 per dose over and above the price of vaccine for vaccine administration at private vaccination centres. State governments have been advised to monitor the price charged at private hospitals,” Dr. Pawar noted. Responding to another question by Rajya Sabha member Narain Dass Gupta, the Minister said the COVID-19 vaccine stock which had not been utilised and nearing expiry were usually taken up for redistribution by respective State governments, for their timely utilisation. States/Union Territories had also been advised to review programme coverage and vaccine wastage on a daily basis and redistribute the vaccine stock, if required, for their optimal utilisation even from private hospitals. “The first dose coverage of 15 years and above is 95.5% and the second dose is 80.6%, hence the pace of vaccination has slowed down relatively as most of the target beneficiaries are already covered,” the Minister noted.  Answering another question by Rajya Sabha member Roopa Ganguly on the National Health Authority being enabled to provide necessary support to States/Union Territories for ensuring free COVID-19 testing and treatment to all eligible beneficiaries under Ayushman Bharat – Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY), Dr. Pawar said COVID-19 treatments were captured in both general and COVID-19 specific packages of the AB-PMJAY.

A lowdown of the causes behind this sudden surge in deaths.  The city has a zero-COVID policy, so the number of cases during the previous waves was very low, resulting in poor immunity levels in the population. When the Omicron wave started in mid-February, only 25% of the 80+ population were vaccinated, among the lowest globally. And so, during the Omicron wave, though the 80+ group formed only 5.4% of the population and 4.7% of COVID-19 cases, they formed more than 70% of the COVID-19 deaths. Vaccination also played a crucial role in fatalities in the 80+ age group.

Trade-in pharmaceutical counterfeits during this period spiked majorly relating to COVID-19 products, including vaccines, medicines, test kits, antibiotics, face masks and sanitizers. This, according to the latest report released by the Authentication Solution Providers’ Association (ASPA), an organisation working against fake medical products.  During the COVID-19 peak, incidents of SF medical were observed in 23 out of 29 States and seven Union Territories. The report pointed out that SF products were impacting every product sector, and the incidents of counterfeiting had risen with a 20% growth from January 2018 to December 2020. Globally also, pharmaceutical SF incidents rose 111% over the past 10 years, say experts.  “Criminals saw the COVID-19 pandemic crisis as an opportunity to sell more substandard and falsified medical products, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the people in need,’’ ASPA president Nakul Pasricha said.  The tremendous adverse impact of the huge increase in circulation of spurious medicine and medical essentials in the fight against the pandemic had almost gone unnoticed. “It is unfortunate, as criminals produce ineffective or harmful products in packaging that appear identical to genuine products to make them difficult to detect. The circulation and use of these SF medical products violate the Right to Health and slows down the pace of providing quality health services that people deserve. It’s high time for firm action to curb this menace. If preventive steps are taken now, we will be better positioned to deliver effective healthcare to patients,” he stated. The ASPA has studied the major counterfeit incident noticed during the COVID-19 period and its impact in the country and released a report titled – “Substandard and falsified medical products, learning from COVID-19 Pandemic and Technological tools to ensure medicines and patient safety”. The report highlighted the trends on pharmaceutical crime and incidents of SF medical products and recommendations to combat it. “We welcome the Government of India’s decision to make QR Codes mandatory on Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs); however, we suggest a comprehensive approach towards building an authentication ecosystem in the country,’’ it noted. National authentication projects have been trending internationally for the last few years, with China, Brazil, Turkey, the U.S., and the EU being the pioneers in this area.

Booster doses are given with two objectives — to reduce the chance of getting infection and to reduce the chance of death, in the event of an infection. These two parameters must be seen separately, said Rajeev Jayadevan, vice-chairman, Research Cell, Indian Medical Association, Kerala. He explained that the first depended on neutralising antibody levels which rapidly declined, while the second depended on T cells and memory B cells, which were long-lasting. “Two years into the pandemic, we are now learning that the umbrella of protection against infection depends on how long ago the most recent infection or vaccine dose was. Thus, whether they get infected or not does not depend only on the vaccine: exposure also plays a role,’’ he said. He added that whether a person died or not from COVID-19 largely depended on the person‘s age, and how many doses of the boosters were required was a contentious matter. “Most of the data available in the world are based on mRNA vaccines. The data on deaths show that in people under the age of 65, adding a third dose makes no further reduction in death rates. In other words, the available evidence suggests that two doses are optimal for death protection, while a recent dose of a booster or natural infection will reduce the chance of another infection for just a few months,’’ said Dr. Jayadevan. A latest study from Israel shows that a fourth dose provides a protection that is of shorter duration than a third dose _ for picking up infection. (Severe disease was already so rare in both groups). This can be called the principle of diminishing returns, as more doses are given after completing the primary vaccination series. What is more important are public health measures to reduce the overall risk of picking up infections. The less the number of infections (especially in older adults) the lower the death numbers will be, say experts. Advocating multiple booster doses, Gurmeet Singh Chabbra, director Pulmonology, QRG Super Speciality Hospital Faridabad, said: “Multiple booster doses should be considered for COVID-19. I feel every five months booster dose should be considered and the vaccine needs to be modified as per current or existing strain prevalent in that region. Patients who have received Pfizer or Moderna vaccine are entitled for booster dose five months after primary vaccination is complete and those who have received Johnson and Johnson receive a booster dose two months after primary vaccination,” he said. Listing out those who should be given priority booster dose, Dr. Chabbra said that elderly of more than 60 years, front line and health care workers, cancer patients or those who were receiving immunosuppressive therapy like solid organ or stem cell transplant patients, HIV patients, who were on high dose steroids etc should be considered for multiple booster doses.  Stating that the protective antibody response to the COVID-19 vaccine was optimum two-three weeks after the first two doses, Rohini Kelkar, senior consultant – Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Metropolis Healthcare said that the antibodies started falling after 6-10 months. “A booster dose given at around six months results in a rise in the antibody levels. Boosters may also be modified to contain proteins of significant mutant strains. Such boosters will probably need to be repeated like the influenza vaccine which is given each year.’’",Bindu Shajan Perappadan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/covid-19-vaccination-debate-on-over-efficacy-of-booster-doses/article65264530.ece
267,"March 26, 2022",18:16 IST,sci-tech,health,Swap transplant brings hope to two families," Two patients, who needed renal transplants after almost four years on dialysis, have found hope in two swap transplants in Bengaluru this month. The transplants took place between two families, who could not donate the organ to their family member because of blood group mismatch. Pradeep Kumar (48), a graphic designer, wanted to donate his kidney to his wife Roopashree (38), but could not do so due to blood group mismatch. Another patient, Raja (44), an electrician, was going through a similar situation. His wife Ashwini, who wanted to donate her kidney to save her husband’s life, could not do so also due to an incompatible blood group. But help came to both families through the swap transplants. While Mr. Kumar donated his kidney to Mr. Raja, Ms. Ashwini donated to Ms. Roopashree. The transplants were done on March 10 at Manipal Hospitals (Hebbal) in the city. The transplant was a success because the male and female from  each couple were willing to undergo laparoscopic surgery, with a kidney donated from an individual who was not compatible with their spouses. “This case exemplifies the success story of recipients — male to male and female to female — of swap couple transplants,” said Manohar T., Consultant Urologist, at the hospital. Girish N.S., Consultant, Nephrology at the hospital said although the wife (Ms. Ashwini) could not donate to her husband (Mr. Raja) due to compatibility issues, she went ahead to save another woman’s life outside her family. The same conscious decision was taken by a man for another man. Such generous acts will help in expanding the donor pool in the country, he said.  More awareness Keshavamurthy R., chairperson of the State Authorisation Committee for organ transplantation, said there is more awareness about swap transplants now. “For many who suffer a renal failure, transplantation is the only medical solution. Although cadaveric donations are on the rise, there is a huge demand-supply gap. Many patients remain on dialysis because they do not find a deceased donor, do not have a family donor, or the family donor that they do have is incompatible. Swap transplants will help minimise the shortfall of kidneys and enable the increase of transplant numbers,” he said. “Although organ transplantation had been badly hit during the pandemic, the situation has come back to normalcy now. We have approved six transplants in the last one month alone,” Dr. Keshavamurthy added.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/swap-transplant-brings-hope-to-two-families/article65262076.ece
268,"March 25, 2022",21:35 IST,sci-tech,health,Data | Will BA.2 lead to another surge in India?," COVID-19 cases are peaking in several East and Southeast Asian and European countries. The surge is fuelled mainly by the BA.2 sub-lineage of the Omicron variant. The rapid rise has caused anxiety in India. Data show that the rise in cases recorded between December 2021 and mid-January 2022 in India (dubbed as the Omicron wave) was in most part due to the BA.2 sub-lineage. So, while the sub-lineage has just become dominant in other nations, it became dominant in India as early as January 2022. Moreover, hospitalisation data show that BA.2 is milder than the previous variants  The graph shows the average cases in select countries since October 1, 2021. South Korea, Vietnam, Germany, Austria, Thailand and Malaysia recorded their pandemic peaks in the last 10 days.

As can be seen from the graph, the share of hospital beds occupied across categories barely crossed the 20% mark during the Omicron wave whereas it reached 100% during the previous waves.

269,"March 25, 2022",16:26 IST,sci-tech,health,Where all in the world is Covid-19 raging now?," The story so far: Many Asian and European nations are witnessing a surge in the number of coronavirus cases, largely driven by the Omicron variant and its sub-variant BA.2. According to Hans Kluge, the World Health Organisation (WHO) director for Europe, the increase in cases has come after European countries “brutally eased restrictions”, news agencies reported.  Here’s a look at the current Covid-19 hotspots around the world.  China has imposed its fifth localised lockdown in the last two weeks to tackle the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the country. Tangshan City, a steel hub in Hebei province, has been put under a full temporary lockdown, according to local authorities. Residents have been asked to not leave their homes or buildings except for tests or emergencies, the government has said.  Rumours of financial hub Shanghai being put under a lockdown were dismissed by the government.  Like many other European nations, the U.K. is also experiencing a surge in coronavirus infections after most restrictions were lifted.  The daily growth of Covid-19 infections in England has increased to +2% to +6% compared to an estimated range of between -2% to +2%, last week, news agency Reuters reported.  In Scotland, government figures reveal that 2,257 people were in the hospital on Tuesday with recently confirmed Covid-19. This is the highest number of patients ever recorded in the hospital on a single day since the beginning of the pandemic.  Britain observed a minute-long silence on Wednesday to remember the victims of the pandemic on the second anniversary of the first lockdown in the country.  South Korea has been overwhelmed by an exponential increase in the number of coronavirus cases in the country. The country has reported over ten million cases overall, and almost three million of these were registered in the last seven days, according to the latest figures provided by the WHO. The record Covid-19 wave is being driven by the Omicron variant of the virus.  The death toll in South Korea has nearly doubled in just about six weeks, increasing demand for funeral arrangements, news agency Reuters reported. In Seoul, 28 crematories were operating at 114.2% capacity as of Monday. The health ministry has instructed nationwide crematories to operate for longer hours.  Germany has decided to go ahead with the scheduled easing of Covid-19 restrictions despite facing a surge in infections driven by the Omicron variant. The country has recorded more than 1.5 million new cases in the last seven days, according to the data provided by the WHO. The total number of infections in Germany since the beginning of the pandemic stands at over 19 million.  France has recorded its biggest jump in the number of Covid-19 cases since February. Hospital numbers rose for the third straight day, and 180,777 new infections were recorded on Tuesday, according to the country’s health ministry. France now has over 34 million registered Covid-19 infections overall. Italy was one of the worst-affected countries when the Covid-19 pandemic began, and has now recorded the third-highest cumulative death toll in Europe after Russia and the U.K. According to the data provided by the WHO, the country has recorded more than half a million new coronavirus cases in the last seven days -- the fourth-highest figure in Europe after Germany, France, and the U.K.  BA.2 is a subvariant of Omicron strain that has been classified as a “variant of concern” by the WHO. BA.2 differs from BA.1 in its genetic sequence, including some amino acid differences in the spike protein and other proteins. The subvariant has also been called “stealth omicron” since it is not easy to detect.  The BA.2 subvariant is inherently more transmissible than BA.1, the WHO has said.

The number of incident TB patients (new and relapse) notified during 2021 was 19,33,381 against the 16,28,161 in 2020, noted India TB Report 2022 released on Thursday. On the World Tuberculosis Day on Thursday, Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya reaffirmed the government’s commitment to making India tuberculosis–free by 2025 and said this will be achieved by ensuring access to quality healthcare and advanced treatment. “Tuberculosis is a preventable and treatable disease. On World TB Day, we reaffirm commitment to make India TB–free by 2025 by ensuring access to quality healthcare and advanced treatment. Together we can and we will eliminate TB,’’ he tweeted.  The report said despite the brief decline in TB notifications observed around the months corresponding to the two major COVID–19 waves, the National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme (NTEP) reclaimed these numbers. It said 18 States have committed to ending TB by 2025 by formally implementing State–specific Strategic Plans and have gone a step ahead to devise a district–specific strategic plan, which shall serve as a guiding tool for the programme managers and staff at the district and sub-district level towards the elimination of Tuberculosis. It said while the world was still reeling under the unsparing effects of the pandemic in 2020 ravaging lives, uprooting livelihoods, crippling national economies and debilitating health infrastructure, the pandemic continued wreaking its havoc in 2021. “Admittedly, the fight against tuberculosis (TB) encountered setbacks in decades of gains. However, the pandemic also forged pathways to ingenious solutions, health–system strengthening and the ever–expanding reach of the public health programme delivery,” it said. The government also released the National TB Prevalence Survey Report which was conducted from 2019 to 2021 to know the actual disease burden of TB at the national level.   The reports said there has been an increase in the mortality rate due to all forms of TB between 2019 and 2020 by 11%. The survey report said prevalence of microbiologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) among 15 years and above in India was 316/lakh population with the highest PTB prevalence of 534/lakh in Delhi and the lowest PTB Prevalence of 115/lakh in Kerala. Higher PTB Prevalence was observed in older age groups, males, malnourished, smokers, alcoholics and known diabetics. COVID has impacted the community level chest X–ray abnormality in general and would have impacted the TB prevalence. “Prevalence of PTB infection among those surveyed in India was 21.7%. Also 63% of the chest symptomatic did not seek health care and the majority had ignored the symptoms and did not recognise it as illness. Among the 37% who consulted, they have equally approached the public (49%) and private sector (49%). A considerable amount of prevalent TB cases were contributed by patients with past history of TB,’’ noted the survey. It recommended that based on the varying State TB prevalence, there is a need to prioritise the interventions in high prevalent States and plan for elimination in low prevalent States. “More interventions for men like occupation screening for TB, nutritional interventions for malnourished, old age screening and interventions for promoting smoking and alcohol cessation needs to be scaled up for better control of PTB to address the factors which have more contribution towards the PTB burden,’’ said the report, adding that there is a need to scale–up treatment of the infection as per the new TB preventive therapy guidelines.",Bindu Shajan Perappadan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/19-increase-from-previous-year-in-tb-patients-notification-in-2021-report/article65255289.ece

Stating that there was need to continue evidence-based decision on restrictions and relaxation, Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan, in a letter, said a test positivity rate of 10% or more in the last week or bed occupancy of more than 40% on either oxygen supported or ICU-beds were grounds for imposing restrictions. The Ministry observed that as the case trajectory may vary from State to State, and there would be variation within a State, there was need to take decisions with respect to containment and restriction measures, primarily at the local/sub-national level by the State and district administration concerned.  It noted that continued focus on community participation for adherence of COVID-19 appropriate behavior, including wearing of mask and physical distancing, would, however, be important measures to be undertaken across the country. “A sustained and significant decline in the number of COVID-19 cases across the country has been observed since the last two months, and from time-to-time, the Ministry has been advising and guiding the States and the Union Territories regarding the recommended strategies for tackling the pandemic through testing, surveillance, containment and restrictions keeping in view the districts as a unit,’’ Mr. Bhushan said. There should be a review of the emerging data of new cases, based on a sustained and critical level of testing. There was also need to follow a risk assessment-based approach to the opening of economic and social activities without losing the gains made so far against the pandemic. Speaking about relaxations in various activities, the Ministry said offline classes could be resumed in academic institutions without any restrictions. “However, the academic institution may also leverage a hybrid model of imparting education through online and offline models,’’ the letter stated.

This, it is claimed, is evidence that placing garlic in you nose relieves congestion. Garlic is known to have anti-tumour, anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties, among other benefits, as illustrated in a 2014 research article titled ‘Garlic: a review of potential therapeutic effects’, published on PubMed Central. But we could not find any hard evidence to support the claim made in the viral video. The Hindu spoke to Dr. Mohan Kameswaran, chief surgeon, Madras ENT Research Foundation, who laughed off the claim, saying, “Some people will do anything I suppose! No, putting garlic up the nose does nothing for the nose or sinuses except creating an unpleasant odour for the unfortunate owner of the nose.” When asked about the mucus seen oozing out of the person’s nose at the end of the video, he said that was most likely induced by the irritation caused by the garlic, unless the person already had a runny nose.  During our research, we also came across various reports on online medical portals where experts were quoted saying this was not a good idea. We found one such report on the site of Cleveland Clinic, a non-profit medical centre in the U.S. In it, Otolaryngologist Raj Sindwani, MD, explained that “blocking your nostril with a pungent piece of garlic can cause more mucus to build, which is what rushes out upon removal of the clove”. He also warned that it could cause irritation or an infection. The claim is false.

However, wearing of face mask and maintaining social distancing norms will continue as earlier.  The Central Government had on March 24, 2020 issued for the first time orders and guidelines under the Disaster Management Act, (DM Act) 2005 for the containment of COVID-19 in the country and these have been modified on various occasions. In a communication to the Chief Secretaries of all States, Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla said that over the last 24 months, significant capacities have been developed for various aspects of management of the pandemic, such as diagnostics, surveillance, contact tracing, treatment, vaccination, hospital infrastructure. Also, the general public now has much higher level of awareness on the COVID-appropriate behaviour, he said. The States and Union Territories have also developed their own capacities and systems and implemented their detailed specific plans for managing the pandemic, he said, adding over the last seven weeks or so there has been a steep decline in the number of cases. The total caseload in the country stands at 23,913 only (on March 22) and the daily positivity rate has declined to 0.28%, he said. It is also worth mentioning that with the combined efforts, a total of 181.56 crore vaccine doses have been administered, he said. “After taking into consideration the overall improvement in the situation and preparedness of the Government to deal with the pandemic, National Disaster Management Authority has taken a decision that there may not be any further need to invoke the provisions of the DM Act for COVID containment measures,” the communication said. Accordingly, Mr. Bhalla said, after the expiry of the existing order on March 31, no further order will be issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).

276,"March 23, 2022",00:20 IST,sci-tech,health,A blow to equitable access to essential medicines," At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in October 2020 and in the midst of concerns over the availability of affordable vaccines, medicines and other medical products, India and South Africa had tabled a proposal in the World Trade Organization (WTO) seeking a temporary waiver on these products from certain obligations under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). Their contention was that the application and enforcement of intellectual property rights (IPRs) were “hindering or potentially hindering timely provisioning of affordable medical products to the patients”. They, therefore, argued that “rapid scaling up of manufacturing globally” was “an obvious crucial solution to address the timely availability and affordability of medical products to all countries in need”, and for doing so, IPRs must be waived for at least three years. By submitting their proposal, India and South Africa had, thus, taken a firm position that when lives are at stake, these products should be treated as global public goods. Nearly 18 months later, 164 members of the WTO could not find common ground on the “waiver proposal” even as 63 developing countries have become co-sponsors of the proposal and another 44 countries lent support from the floor. Initially, all advanced countries opposed the proposal, but after the Biden Administration took office, the United States (U.S.) backed the waiver, but only for vaccines. The stance of the advanced countries is hardly surprising as they have always put the interests of pharmaceutical companies ahead of the lives of the ordinary citizens in many countries who are yet to be fully vaccinated. As of today, only 14% of people in low-income countries have received at least one vaccine dose. What is worse, the recent surge of infections in China is a strong warning to the global community that the threat from COVID-19 still remains. In this complex situation, when one of the consistent opponents of the “waiver proposal”, namely, the European Union (EU), announces that the differences over the proposal had been resolved, there is considerable interest in the details. This interest becomes even greater when it is revealed that India and South Africa, the movers of the “waiver proposal”, are among the four countries that found a “compromise outcome”. The U.S. is the fourth WTO member of the “Quad” proposing the way forward. The EU, which has unveiled the “solution”, states that this is a “compromise outcome” that will now be “put … forward for [WTO] members’ consideration”. Interestingly, the “compromise outcome” adopts the approach that the EU has been proposing all along — namely, granting compulsory licences to enhance vaccine production.  While opposing the concept of “waiver” of application and enforcement of IPRs, the EU had proposed in a submission in June 2021 that “[c]ompulsory licences are a perfectly legitimate tool that governments may wish to use in the context of a pandemic”. It is, therefore, surprising to find that three of the four “Quad” members, who have been supporting the waiver proposal (the U.S. had extended limited support), have diluted their stand and have accepted the EU’s proposal as the “compromise outcome”. Generally, patent laws, including that of India’s, allow for the grant of compulsory licences if patent holders charge high prices on the proprietary medicines in exercise of their monopoly rights. Moreover, such licences can usually be granted if efforts in obtaining voluntary licences from the patent holders have failed. The “Quad” proposal states there that in case of a medical urgency, as is the case now, this condition will be waived. In other words, there is no requirement to make efforts to obtain voluntary licences with the patent holders before granting compulsory licences on the patented products. The “Quad” solution also provides that WTO members would be able to issue compulsory licences even if they do not currently have the provisions to issue them under their national patent laws. Compulsory licences can even be granted using executive orders, emergency decrees, and judicial or administrative orders. The compulsory licensing system that the “Quad” has proposed contains considerable details, the implications of which need to be understood. The “Quad” solution can be used only by an “eligible member”, defined as a “developing country member” of the WTO that “had exported less than 10 percent of world exports of COVID-19 vaccine doses in 2021”. The eligibility criteria, therefore, implies that the least developed countries are excluded. This means that Bangladesh, which is still a least developed country, but has a growing pharmaceutical industry, is also excluded. The eligibility condition seems to have been introduced to limit China’s expansion in the global vaccine market. According to the WTO, this was 33.7%, as on January 31, 2022, but the reality is that China is not one of the countries that would benefit from the “Quad” solution. China has developed several home-grown vaccines and hence does not need compulsory licences to expand its production base. At the current juncture, India does not have to be concerned with the export restriction clause, as its share in global exports of vaccines was 2.4% as on January 31. While introducing the above-mentioned export restriction, the “Quad” solution proposes to waive the obligation under Article 31(f) of the TRIPS Agreement. Article 31(f) provides that the compulsory licences issued by any WTO member must be used “predominantly for the supply of the domestic market”. The “Quad” solution states that the export restriction in 31(f) was removed as there was a “long standing request from the waiver proponents that want to be free to export any proportion of the COVID-19 vaccine”. But while they have proposed removal of Article 31(f), the “Quad” solution includes a more stringent export restriction in the form of the eligibility criteria mentioned above. The “Quad” solution is a severely truncated version of the “waiver proposal” in terms of product coverage, as only vaccines are included. The proponents of the “waiver proposal” sought to include not only medicines, vaccines, and medical equipment but also the methods and the means of manufacturing the products necessary for the prevention, treatment, or containment of COVID-19. Further, the “Quad” has introduced additional conditions to using the compulsory licences, some of which are well beyond the developing country obligations under the TRIPS Agreement. For instance, the proposed condition of listing all patents covered under the compulsory licences is not a requirement under the TRIPS Agreement. Similarly, there is no obligation to notify the details of licensee, the quantity and export destination under the TRIPS provisions, but the Quad text proposes mandatory notification.  However, compulsory licences may not result in the outcome that the waiver proponents were aiming for. According to the EU, when compulsory licences are granted, the “patent holder receives adequate remuneration”, but “[t]ransfer of know-how is not ensured”. This plain admission by the EU about the demerits of compulsory licences would make it difficult to scale up production of COVID-19 vaccines, medicines, and medical devices in the developing world, thus constraining their availability at affordable prices. Finally, it must be said that by accepting the “compromise outcome”, India and South Africa could jeopardise their high moral ground which they had gained through their attempt to make medicines and medical products necessary for COVID-19 treatment or containment as global public goods. Consequently, the global community would lose an important opportunity to ensure that vaccines and medicines are accessible to all. Biswajit Dhar is Professor, Centre for Economic Studies and Planning, School of Social Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University.

It was an independent study done by a team of researchers from their Department of Mathematics and Statistics who have prepared a mathematical model and submitted the same to a pre-print server for experts to comment on. The same was not peer-reviewed, the Health Ministry submitted in the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday.  Responding to a question by member Brijlal, Minister of State in Health Ministry Dr. Bharati Pravin Pawar said that modelling studies were based on certain set of inputs, either based on real world scenarios or approximations of those inputs that were not available (which may vary in accuracy according to the technique used). “Often these studies involve taking a relatively small actual sample and extrapolate the result to the entire population,” she explained.  While this may achieve near accurate results for a small homogenous country/region, such techniques had failed repeatedly to give reliable results for a large, diverse population, she noted. Given the emergence of variants of COVID-19 virus with variable transmissibility and other public health implications, the Health Ministry said it was closely following COVID-19 trajectory globally and in the country along with various expert committees.  In addition, the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) of laboratories was undertaking whole genome sequencing of samples for timely detection of mutant variants of virus.  The stakeholders were being provided requisite technical and financial support to enhance preparedness and response capacities against COVID-19 and other public health emergencies. “Funding support has been provided to the States/UTs for health system strengthening to meet any exigency due to resurgence of cases in the country through the National Health Mission, State Disaster Response Funds (SDRF) and Emergency COVID-19 Response and preparedness packages,’’ the Minister observed.  Regular review meetings were being undertaken with all relevant stakeholders, including subject experts and the States, to review the preparedness and response measures to address the pandemic following the five-fold strategy of test-tack-treat-vaccinate and adherence to COVID appropriate behaviour.

278,"March 22, 2022",15:32 IST,sci-tech,health,Explained | What is the World Happiness Report?," The story so far: For the fifth consecutive year, Finland secured the top spot in the  World Happiness Index.   According to the World Happiness Report (2022), Finland’s score was “significantly ahead of other countries in the top ten”. Denmark secured the second spot, followed by Iceland, Switzerland, Netherlands and Luxemburg. Lebanon and Afghanistan ranked the lowest. Produced by the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the country’s exploratory magazine, This is Finland stated that Finland, as well as several Nordic countries, have worked to create a society that possessed an “infrastructure of happiness”. It added, “Social systems in Finland and rest of the Nordics support democratic governance and human rights, not to mention education and healthcare that are free or charge only very nominal fees.”   Separately, global benevolence, the report states, increased 25% in 2021 compared to its pre-pandemic level. This was led by helping out strangers, alongside strong growth in donations and volunteering. The top ten countries with the largest gains from 2008-12 to 2019-2021 were, in order, Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Togo, Bahrain, Latvia, Benin, Guinea and Armenia.  India ranked 136 among 146 countries in the Index.   As per its website, The World Happiness Report, a publication of the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), uses survey data to determine how people evaluate their lives in more than 150 countries. In simpler terms, the report presents a framework gauging people’s qualitative assessment of their lives, progress and well-being through quantitative indicators.   The report aspires to prioritise discussions on happiness among governments and academics for assessment and establishment of social and economic objectives.   United Nations (U.N.) adopted Resolution 65/309 titled “Happiness: Towards a holistic approach to development” in July 2011. They called on governments to impart greater importance to happiness and well-being whilst pursuing social and economic development.  In April 2012, the Royal Government of Bhutan convened a high-level meeting for global representatives on wellbeing and happiness as a new economic paradigm. There, Bhutan’s Prime Minister Jigmi Y. Thinley accepted the recommendation to appoint a commission for the same. He proposed that commission could perhaps be co-owned by the U.N. and operate in collaboration with the body’s Secretary General. Chaired by Mr. Thinley and Economist Jeffery D Sachs, the first World Happiness Report was presented to review the evidence for the suggested theme of the meet.  The U.N. General Assembly adopted Resolution 66/281 proclaiming March 20 as the International Day of Happiness to be observed annually. The World Happiness Report is released every year on the same date.  Bhutan has a self-devised Gross National Happiness Index that assess happiness and well-being of the population using 33 indicators under 9 domains.   The rankings (called the World Happiness Index) use both secondary and survey data in order to formulate the ranking.  The parameters for assessment include GDP per capita in terms of Purchasing Power parity (PPP), healthy life expectancy at birth, level of social support, generosity, perceptions on corruption and freedom to make life choices.   Life expectancy and GDP per capita are computed from ready-made data of the World Bank and World Health Organisation (WHO) respectively.   Sample size: The other metrics rely on Gallup World Poll surveys. It reaches out typically to 1,000 people in a country annually. The surveyors state they are unable to reach out to many countries for the annual survey. In countries where they have been able to conduct annual surveys on a recurrent basis, the sample size spikes to 3,000.  Grading operandi: All questions pertaining to the respondent’s evaluation of their life is answered using Cantrill Ladder grading operandi. They are asked to imagine a ladder, with the best possible life for them being a 10 and the worst being 0. The sub-bars indicate the extent to which each of the six factors may potentially contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than in ‘Dystopia’.   To assess, social support, the surveys had questions as ““If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them, or not?”. To assess Generosity, the surveyors ask, “Have you donated money to a charity in the past month?”.   Dystopia as a benchmark: Other than this, the Index also establishes a benchmark called ‘Dystopia’.  “The purpose in establishing Dystopia is to have a benchmark against which all countries can be favourably compared (no country performs more poorly than Dystopia) in terms of each of the six key variables, thus allowing each sub-bar to be of positive (or zero, in six instances) width,” the report informs.   On an average, the latest report states, there has been a long-term moderate upward trend in stress, worry, and sadness in most countries and a slight long-term decline in the enjoyment of life.   Separately, it observed experiences of balance, peace and calm are more prevalent in Western countries as compared to countries in East Asia. Further, the western countries also experience higher levels of satisfaction. Irrespective, majority of people in almost every country prefer a calmer life to an exciting one, the report mentions. “But that preference is no higher in Eastern countries than elsewhere. However, it is particularly high in the poorer countries, especially in Africa, where actual calm is low,” the report reads.  ",Saptaparno Ghosh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/explained-what-is-the-world-happiness-report/article65240772.ece
279,"March 22, 2022",10:30 IST,sci-tech,health,Adaptive tracking," S.M. Rudman et al, Science 375, eabj7484 (2022), DOI: 10.1126/science.abj7484 It is a common belief that evolutionary changes take place at a much slower pace than ecological change. However, this is not completely true, and there is now mounting evidence to the contrary albeit under certain circumstances. In this line of thought, an experimental study of Drosophila melanogaster, or fruit fly, has shown that the pace of adaptation can match that of environmental and seasonal changes. The work, published in Science, studies adaptive tracking, which is defined as continuous adaptation in response to rapid environmental change. Adaptive tracking is known to be the critical mechanism by which living beings continue to thrive in a changing environment, but little is known about the pace, extent and magnitude of adaptive tracking in response to a changing environment. Rudman et al conducted experiments on 10 independent replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster, each being a group of up to 1,00,000 individuals. The flies were kept in boxes 2m X 2m X 2m in size and placed near a dwarf peach tree, outdoors, in Philadelphia. The fruit fly is the preferred animal model for many experimental studies of evolution because it is relatively easy to breed and maintain, and multiplies rapidly, allowing many generations to be studied in a short time. The researchers measured the evolution of heritable and observable physical characteristics over time. These could be stress tolerance such as survival under cold, hunger and dessication or related to fitness or reproductive traits such as developmental rate and egg-laying, respectively. The flies were exposed to a changing season from July-December in 2014, and monthly measurements were made. The authors write that they focussed on generating highly accurate measurements, taking these measurements on a time-scale matching that of environmental change and collecting measurements from 10 independent populations. Taking measurements from parallel lineages of fruit fly and finding similar changes in the populations which did not themselves interact ensured that the changes were indeed due to selection and not due to random inherited factors. There was an interesting observation, as pointed out in a Perspective piece about the work in Science, written by Ary H. Hoffmann and Thomas Flatt, that the rate of the phenotypic (observable, physical characteristics of an organism) evolution varied according to the trait. While chill coma recovery, a marker of resistance to cold, increased as winter progressed, dessication resistance increased, plateaued and then decreased. But overall, the rates of evolution of these traits was rapid and matched the requirements of adaptive tracking. While the paper establishes that fly populations can rapidly adapt to seasonal changes, the authors of the Perspective article remark that this may perhaps be anticipated theoretically because fruit fly populations are large, with huge genetic variation, which makes the effects of rare mutations on the evolution minimal. This means even a weak selection could be sufficient to drive a fast evolution. However, they point out that while theories suggest that adaptive tracking may be hindered by factors such as the reduction in fitness due to the lag in adaptation after an environmental change, this is not observed in the real drosophila populations. The researchers conclude that this experiment demonstrates how you can see adaptive tracking in response to environmental change in real time by observing multiple parallelly evolving populations. The action of fluctuating selection implies that evolutionary rates may have been underestimated and that fluctuating selection may play a role in maintaining biodiversity. They write: “Determining whether adaptive tracing is a general feature of natural populations, and elucidating the mechanisms by which it occurs, can be transformative for understanding the generation and maintenance of biodiversity.”",Shubashree Desikan,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/adaptive-tracking/article65246448.ece

281,"March 20, 2022",01:08 IST,sci-tech,health,Explained | What is the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority’s role in fixing drug prices?," The story so far: Consumers may have to pay more for medicines and medical devices if the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) allows a price hike of over 10% in the drugs and devices listed under the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM), this coming month. The escalation which is expected to have an impact on nearly 800 drugs and devices is propelled by the rise in the Wholesale Price Index (WPI). Lobby groups that represent domestic pharmaceutical companies have been engaging with the Central Government to ask it to extend the 10% annual hike to scheduled formulations under price control. Prices of Scheduled Drugs are allowed an increase each year by the drug regulator in line with the WPI and the annual change is controlled and rarely crosses 5%. But the pharmaceutical players pointed out that over the past few years, input costs have flared up. “The hike has been a long-standing demand by the pharma industry lobby. All medicines under the NLEM are under price regulation. As per the Drugs (Prices) Control Order 2013, scheduled drugs, about 15% of the pharma market, are allowed an increase by the government as per the WPI while the rest 85% are allowed an automatic increase of 10% every year. The pharma lobby is now asking for at least a 10% increase for scheduled drugs too than going by the WPI,” said an industry expert. The NPPA was set up in 1997 to fix/revise prices of controlled bulk drugs and formulations and to enforce price and availability of the medicines in the country, under the Drugs (Prices Control) Order, 1995-2013. Its mandate is to implement and enforce the provisions of the Drugs (Prices Control) Order in accordance with the powers delegated to it, to deal with all legal matters arising out of the decisions of the NPPA and to monitor the availability of drugs, identify shortages and to take remedial steps. The ceiling price of a scheduled drug is determined by first working out the simple average of price to retailer in respect of all branded and generic versions of that particular drug formulation having a market share of more than or equal to 1%, and then adding a notional retailer margin of 16% to it. The ceiling price fixed/revised by the NPPA is notified in the Gazette of India (Extraordinary) from time to time. The NPPA is also mandated to collect/maintain data on production, exports and imports, market share of individual companies, profitability of companies etc., for bulk drugs and formulations and undertake and/ or sponsor relevant studies in respect of pricing of drugs/ pharmaceuticals. Prices are revised when there is a rise in the price of bulk drugs, raw materials, cost of transport, freight rates, utilities like fuel, power, diesel, and changes in taxes and duties. The cost rises for imported medicines with escalation in insurance and freight prices, and depreciation of the rupee. The annual hike in the prices of drugs listed in the NLEM is based on the WPI. The NLEM lists drugs used to treat fever, infection, heart disease, hypertension, anaemia etc and includes commonly used medicines like paracetamol, azithromycin etc. Speaking about the proposed move Chinu Srinivasan, co-convener, All-India Drug Action Network (AIDAN), pointed out that one of the challenges is that 60%-70% of the country’s medicine needs are dependent on China. “Self-reliance for India also means self-reliance in bulk drugs (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients/APIs) and chemicals/intermediates that go into making the drug.” Mr. Srinivasan also said the method to calculate the annual ceiling price increase should be revisited. “WPI is dependent on price rise in a basket of a range of goods that are not directly linked with the items that go into the cost of medicines. More importantly, the unrealistic simple average method of calculating ceiling prices should be replaced by a cost-plus mechanism that was prevalent under the earlier DPCO 1995,” he said.

282,"March 20, 2022",00:30 IST,sci-tech,health,Explained | Will a limited and conditional WTO nod to remove intellectual property rights on the use of COVID-19 vaccines help?," The story so far: At the World Trade Organisation (WTO) negotiations, a consensus is in sight on a pending proposal championed by India and South Africa in 2020 that sought to remove intellectual property rights restrictions on the use of COVID-19 vaccines, drugs and diagnostic devices. The reprieve, however, will come with certain conditions, which are still under discussion.  In October 2020, at the WTO’s Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Council, India and South Africa proposed that the WTO do away with certain provisions of the TRIPS Agreement for the duration of the pandemic to facilitate access to technologies necessary for the production of vaccines and medicines. Such a waiver would aid scaling up of local production, critical to ensure wider access to affordable and effective vaccines. Most of these patents are held by pharmaceutical companies in the U.S. and the European Union. The waiver proposal was blocked at the TRIPS Council and the WTO ministerial Council though there have been several rounds of discussions involving ministers of several WTO member-countries. In the last year though 100 countries, including the U.S., supported the proposal, the EU remained a stumbling block. But now the EU too appears to be calling a truce. Reports have emerged that India, South Africa, the U.S. and the EU have arrived at an agreement. A draft of this agreement, that has been circulated among 164 members of the WTO, is likely to be taken up for discussion this fortnight. A consensus of all members is necessary for a proposal to be approved. The draft says all patent rights that protect the manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccines will be waived of for three-five years. Usually, there are multiple patents that cover even a single COVID vaccine and the draft says all of these line-patents too would stand temporarily waived. All member countries, through their governments, can authorise the manufacture as well as export of vaccines produced in these conditions.  There’s conflicting opinion on this. On the one hand, the pandemic isn’t over, and despite the widespread adoption of vaccines, (many of them employing very novel technology platforms such as mRNA and adenovirus vaccine technology) the evidence is overwhelming that vaccines are only protective against severe disease but ineffective at curbing transmission. It is possible that vaccines developed using the early strains of the virus may become ineffective over time and newer ones, potentially employing newer approaches, may be necessary in the months and years ahead. As relatively few countries have expertise in making vaccines, a waiver of this sort could help improve global access. These same set of reasons, critics of the draft say, could be used to argue that such a waiver for vaccines is too little, too late. Global facilities such as COVAX, that are charged with ensuring all countries get vaccines now have too many vaccines — a flip from merely three months ago — when there was a scarcity. India too has multiple manufacturers and technology platforms, and greater than 60% of the population is fully vaccinated. All this, without patent waivers. While pharmaceutical patents have historically been impediments to the manufacture of affordable, high-quality drugs, the global nature of the pandemic has seen that even though richer nations hoarded vaccines, prioritising multiple inoculations for their citizens, over even a single shot for African countries, intellectual property rights on its own didn’t prove to be a hurdle. There are other major lacunae in the draft agreement.  Critics say that central to the process of vaccine manufacturing are ‘trade secrets’ that specify the ingredients and chain of steps necessary to make them. The current waiver doesn’t automatically compel patent rights holders to share this information with a potential manufacturer for free. Another drawback is that this waiver is limited to vaccines. The original proposal sought a waiver on therapeutics and diagnostics and the agreement only says that a “discussion” on this can be held after six months. Access to new drugs and diagnostic technologies are necessary to keep people safe everywhere.  Editorial | Too little, too late: On COVID-19 vaccines and patent rights Though no one has commented on the draft, prominent drug and vaccine companies in India haven’t been very vocal on the need for a waiver. But the Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI), comprising Indian subsidiaries of western pharmaceutical companies, has been critical. Waiving of intellectual property rights will neither lead to increased production of vaccines nor practical solutions to fight the virus, as IP “is not the barrier” to vaccines. The Indian Drug Manufacturers Association, on the other hand, has supported it, with a caveat. They are more interested in “voluntary licences” by the patent holders to Indian companies with sufficient expertise in this field, and transferring technology to Indian companies against “reasonable” royalties.

283,"March 19, 2022",23:28 IST,sci-tech,health,Ashish Jha | Biden’s COVID response chief," In early 2020, when the U.S. was confronting the first wave of COVID-19, with its health system starting to feel the strain, a Harvard physician had said on a morning news show: “We can either have a national quarantine now, two weeks, get a grip on where things are, and then reassess, or we can not, wait another week, and when things look really terrible, be forced into it.” Almost two years later, the public health expert is saying, “pulling back on mask mandates for now is very reasonable,” as he advises keeping testing rates high for a possible new surge. The man is Indian-origin physician Dr. Ashish Jha, U.S. President Joe Biden’s newly-appointed COVID-19 response coordinator, who will replace Jeffrey D. Zients, a management consultant. Dr. Jha’s appointment comes at a time when America is entering a new phase of the pandemic. After successive waves tested the limits of the country’s public health system and claimed over a million lives, COVID-19 numbers are now in decline. As three quarters of the country's population are vaccinated at least once, and as it closely watches for the threat of the new BA.2 variant driving a surge in Europe, Dr. Jha’s appointment signifies a strategic shift in the country’s pandemic response. The Dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health, Dr. Jha brings to the table almost two decades of experience in public health and health policy research. Before assuming his current position at Brown in 2020, he was the faculty director of the Harvard Global Health Institute and professor of global health at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. As a doctor of internal medicine, he has practised in Massachusetts and Providence. Born in Pursaulia, Bihar, in 1970, he first moved to Canada in 1979 and then to the U.S. in 1983. An economics graduate, Dr. Jha, before pursuing internal medicine training at the University of California, got his M.D. from Harvard Medical School in 1997. In 2004, he earned his masters of public health from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He has to his name “groundbreaking” research on Ebola and jointly heading West Africa’s strategy to tackle the outbreak of the disease in 2014. Dr. Jha’s academic research, of over 200 empirical papers, focuses on enhancing the quality of healthcare systems and how national policies impact healthcare. He has studied extensively how state funds for health can be utilised for efficiency. Offering straightforward yet measured advice at almost every stage of the pandemic on multiple television shows and through clear and comprehensive Twitter threads, Dr. Jha became “America’s everyman expert on Covid-19,” according to health news site STAT. For policy makers, his data-centric responses, backed by practical public health experience, became guiding threads for weaving pandemic response strategies. He has also testified in two U.S. Congressional hearings on the COVID-19 vaccine rollout and on the global impact of the pandemic. Despite sounding warning bells and calling for caution, Dr. Jha has had an optimistic outlook of the pandemic. In May 2021, for instance, while talking about herd immunity, Dr. Jha wrote in a Twitter thread: “We won't be done even if we get to 80% (herd immunity). We’ll need to monitor variants, vaccinate the world, continue testing, etc. But this is all manageable. We'll settle into a new equilibrium as we do with many viruses And COVID won't dominate our lives. And that's what matters.” Even when the Biden administration took over to steer and fix the previous administration’s response, Dr. Jha had said rejoining the WHO and reviving the U.S.’ leading role in it won’t solve things. He emphasised on how pandemics are truly global in the 21st century, and the U.S. or the West cannot just ‘lead’ alone in global health, but work with international partners, take cross-border health measures and exchange knowledge to “decolonise” global health. While thanking Mr. Biden for appointing him as the new pandemic response chief, Dr. Jha said: “To the American people, I promise I will be straightforward and clear in sharing what we know, in explaining what we don’t know and how we will learn more, and what the future will ask of all of us.”",Diksha Munjal,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ashish-jha-bidens-covid-response-chief/article65240060.ece
284,"March 18, 2022",01:40 IST,sci-tech,health,19 firms in India to make Pfizer’s oral COVID-19 antiviral drug,"  Nineteen drugmakers in India have signed sublicence agreements with the United Nations-backed Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) to manufacture the generic version of Pfizer’s oral COVID-19 antiviral nirmatrelvir, which is to be used in combination with ritonavir. They are among the 35 companies across 12 countries to have entered into such agreements with MPP for manufacturing and supplying to 95 low and middle income countries, including India. The non-exclusive sublicences allow the generic manufacturers to produce raw ingredients for nirmatrelvir and/or the finished drug itself co-packaged with ritonavir. The agreements follow the voluntary licensing agreement MPP and Pfizer signed in November 2021. Pfizer markets its oral COVID-19 treatment under the name of Paxlovid, which has received emergency use/conditional authorisation from USFDA and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).  Of the 35, six companies will focus on producing the drug substance, nine will produce the drug product and the rest will do both. Pfizer will not receive royalties from sales of nirmatrelvir from the MPP sublicensees so long as COVID-19 remains classified as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the WHO. MPP said the companies offered the sublicence demonstrated their ability to meet its requirements related to production capacity, regulatory compliance, as well as international standards for quality-assured medicines. “Nirmatrelvir is a new product and requires substantial manufacturing capabilities to produce. We have been very impressed with the quality of manufacturing demonstrated by these companies,” MPP Executive Director Charles Gore said. Sun Pharma, Biocon, Aurobindo Pharma, Cadila, Torrent Pharma, Strides, MSN Pharma, Laurus Labs, Granules, Divis Laboratories, Glenmark, Cipla, Emcure, Viatris, Amneal, Arene Lifesciences, Macleods, SMS Pharmaceuticals and Hetero are the 19 drugmakers to receive the sublicence. Besides from India, the other companies are in Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Dominican Republic, Jordan, Israel, Mexico, Pakistan, Serbia, South Korea and Vietnam. MPP said a licence had also been offered to a company in Ukraine and the offer would remain available as the firm was not able to sign due to the current conflict. Aurobindo Vice-Chairman and Managing Director K. Nithyananda Reddy said the company had already developed and commercialised ritonavir which is used as a booster along with nirmatrelvir. “We are excited to work on this molecule and will soon make it available commercially at an affordable price for these markets after due process of registration and approval in various countries, including the DCGI in India,” he said.",N.

The court’s remarks came while allowing Santosh Medical College, an institute being run and managed by Santosh Trust which was formally known as Maharaji Educational Trust to increase seats in postgraduate and undergraduate courses. The High Court permitted the college to “increase the seats from 4 to 7 in MS (Obstetrics & Gynaecology), from 3 to 7 in MS (Orthopaedics), and from 100-150 in the MBBS course”. “At a time when the ratio of medical profession vis-a-vis the population of the country is abysmally low, an increase in the number of PG and UG seats would certainly contribute to the bigger goal of strengthening the medical infrastructure of the country,” the High Court said as it quashed the orders of the National Medical Commission (NMC) denying the trust’s application to increase the seats. The trust runs and manages a group of medical, dental, paramedical, and para-dental colleges/institutions in the National Capital Region, including Santosh Medical College which is a medical educational institute, offering MBBS course and postgraduate courses. “No doubt, the respondents [NMC] cannot be asked to lower the standards prescribed under the regulations,” the court said. But added that in a situation like the present, when it is found that the institute, which has been running for the last more than 20 years is not lacking in any infrastructure and has also rectified the deficiencies which were found at the time of initial inspections, “it would also be against public interest to deny permission to the petitioner to increase the seats,” the judge said. “In fact, the exemplary work done by the petitioner institute during this trying time of COVID-19 has been highly appreciated by one and all, including the State and the Union government, as is evident by the fact that the petitioner has received the Ayushman Award from the Central government in 2021 as well as an award from the State government in 2022 for its persistent and dedicated service in combating the COVID pandemic,” the High Court said.",Staff Reporter,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-hc-worried-over-lack-of-quality-affordable-medical-colleges-in-country/article65231039.ece

The Health Assembly adopted a decision titled “The World Together” at its second special session since it was founded in 1948. As per the decision, the health organisation established an intergovernmental negotiating body to draft a pandemic treaty. The pandemic treaty is expected to cover aspects like data sharing and genome sequencing of emerging viruses.

288,"March 16, 2022",11:31 IST,sci-tech,health,Patent rights on COVID-19 vaccines may be waived for five years,"  Intellectual property rights held by international pharmaceutical companies on COVID-19 vaccines may be relaxed for up to five years, according to a proposal by the European Union (EU) in the backdrop of a festering two-year-old dispute at the World Trade Organisation involving India, U.S., South Africa and the EU. This reprieve will, however, not apply to COVID-19 drugs and diagnostic devices, though the EU proposes a “discussion” on this in the next six months and also rebuffs India’s original demand for a complete waiver on intellectual property restrictions on covid therapeutics.  This waiver will allow pharmaceutical companies in developing countries to not only make but also, further down, export vaccines without explicit permission from the patent holders, says a version of the negotiation text that The Hindu has viewed. A discussion on the text is expected in the fortnight ahead, a person familiar with the proceedings, but who declined to be identified, told The Hindu. Though India, along with South Africa, was among the proponents of the original waiver in 2020, it is unclear to what extent this proposal will benefit Indian manufacturers, who have in the last year, not only entered into licensing arrangements with global pharmaceutical companies but also developed indigenous vaccines. Nearly 100 countries including the United States support the Indian position but the EU has  Many developing countries, including India, already have a system of compulsory licensing regime, whereby exigencies can permit the government to authorise production of a drug or vaccine irrespective of whether it is protected by patents. India has also administered over a 1.7 billion vaccines locally and has exported at least 30 crore vaccines to neighbouring countries as well as supplied to the international COVAX facility. A clause in the current text says that these “waivers” would apply to developing countries that have not exported more than 10% of the COVID-19 vaccine doses in 2021 and it is unclear if India is included in this definition. A person aware of these developments said that as the provisions only applied to “patented” products and as firms such as Moderna and Pfizer had not patented their vaccines in India, it would not necessarily facilitate their manufacture in India.  “More than the patent, it’s the manufacturing know-how that matters. This aspect, which falls under trade secret, may continue to be withheld,” the person added. Biswajit Dhar, an expert on international trade and Professor at the Jawaharlal Nehru University and who saw the draft document said that the current format wasn’t progressive. “This is in essence the same as the provisions on compulsory licensing. India has historically been a leader of developing countries’ positions at the WTO. In this matter there has been no real push by India. This lethargy might have serious consequences in future negotiations.” Another person who’s close to TRIPS negotiations proceedings told The Hindu on condition of anonymity that India was “playing it safe” at the global tables. “The pandemic isn’t over yet. More than patent waivers, Indian industry is worried about the supply lines (of components necessary to make drugs and diagnostics) being cut off by the West if we are adamant on a complete waiver. We have now plenty of vaccines but drugs are a different deal.” The negotiations began after India sent a letter to the Director-General of WTO Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala on December 23 asking for a virtual, ministerial conference to be held on the issue of the TRIPS waivers, to accelerate talks on the original India-South Africa proposal submitted in October 2020. There has since been a four-way, ministerial consultation in January, and meetings by officials of key players U.S., EU, India and South Africa were ongoing, as The Hindu reported last month, to look at various proposals, of which the U.S.-EU proposal for “geographical exclusions” were high on the agenda. These included talks to devise a patent waiver regime that would exclude India. There were also suggestions to limit the kind of medical products to counter COVID-19 that would be on the list of waivers, as well as restricting the waivers to a certain part of the Intellectual Property (IP), and not a full product and patent waiver. Pharmaceutical bodies in India have been divided on the question of a waiver. The Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India, that is made up of Indian subsidiaries of Western pharmaceutical companies, has been critical of a waiver. “Waiving of IP rights will neither lead to increased production of vaccines or increased deployment nor practical solutions to fight the virus of COVID-19 vaccines since IP is not the barrier to adequate availability of vaccines in India. Waiving of intellectual property rights could impact patient safety by opening doors for counterfeit vaccines to enter the supply chain,” said a statement issued in May 2021. “Our topmost priority should be to address the supply side constraints, including IP barriers, to augment the manufacturing of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, essential for treatment, prevention and control of the ongoing pandemic.” The Indian Drug Manufacturers Association, on the other hand, has supported, with a caveat, the waiving off of IP rights for COVID-19 drugs to expand availability. “What is more important is grant of voluntary licences by the patent holders to Indian companies with sufficient expertise in this field and similarly transfer technology to Indian companies against reasonable royalties,” the organisation said in a position paper last May. Bharat Biotech, the makers of Covaxin, had told The Hindu in a statement that it was for “voluntary” technology transfer partnerships.  Ashwani Mahajan, of the RSS-affliated Swadeshi Jagran Manch and a participant at previous WTO negotiations said in a letter to Commerce Minister, Piyush Goyal, that India’s TRIPS waiver outcome must ensure that global companies also share their trade secrets (the manufacturing knowhow) to facilitate global production. “It should coer bother patented and products pending patent applications...The WTO Secretariat is notorious for its support of US and EU positions and consequently misleaing and inaccurate legal analyses....India shouldn’t agree to any text until it has been fully vetted and endorsed by India’s technical experts,” said the letter on 18th February. India and South Africa jointly had sponsored a proposal in October 2020 and this was updated, with representation from several low- and middle-income countries — though with the notable omission of China — to expand the scope of the waiver to “all health products and technologies” and to have the waiver in place for at least a year.  The patent protections result from provision of the TRIPS to which WTO members are bound to.",Jacob Koshy,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/patent-rights-on-covid-19-vaccines-may-be-waived-for-five-years/article65230047.ece

The government is yet to issue an official statement on mixed-use dose of vaccine for any cohort. Only those who had attained the age of 12 on the date of vaccination are to be vaccinated; if the beneficiary had registered but not attained the age of 12 on the date of vaccination, the vaccine is not to be given. Those born in 2008, 2009 and 2010, i.e., those who are already above 12 years are now eligible to get the vaccine from March 16, the Ministry stated.  “States are advised to organise dedicated vaccination sessions through earmarked COVID-19 Vaccination Centers for vaccination of 12-14 years’ age-group to avoid mixing with other vaccines,’’ it noted. The States/UTs have been informed that at present the age of beneficiary in CoWIN was being filtered based on the year of birth.  “The responsibility for verification of age [12 years] will lie with the vaccinator/verifier at the time of vaccination for the first few days, as the provision for recording the exact date of birth on the CoWIN portal is under process. Once implemented, the system, by default, will not allow registration of beneficiaries who are not of the recommended age,’’ the Ministry explained. Free of cost vaccination of all beneficiaries of the 12-14 age group would begin from Wednesday, National Vaccination Day, at all government COVID-19 vaccination centers and the vaccine to be administered would be Corbevax, manufactured by Biological E. Limited, Hyderabad. The vaccine is to be given inter-muscular and follows a two-dose regime at the interval of 28 days.   “The vaccine can be accessed through online registration [beginning 9 a.m. on Wednesday) or through onsite walk-in,’’ Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said in a videoconference meeting on Tuesday with all the States and UTs.  Additionally, all above 60 years are now eligible for the precaution dose from Wednesday, as the condition of comorbidity for this age group has been removed.  “The Precaution Dose (same as the previous two doses) is to be administered after 9 months (36 weeks) after the date of second vaccination. Detailed instructions and Operational Guidelines have been sent to States and UTs in this regard,’’ said a release issued by the Health Ministry. Underscoring the slow pace of vaccination among the vulnerable groups, the States have also been asked to ensure that all those above 60 were covered with both doses vaccine. Regular reviews are to be conducted at district and block levels to ensure coverage of eligible beneficiaries, the Ministry highlighted. The States have also been advised to ensure judicious utilisation of available vaccines.

It has declined from 113 in 2016-18 to 103 in 2017-19 (8.8 % decline). The country had been witnessing a progressive reduction in the MMR from 130 in 2014-2016, 122 in 2015-17, 113 in 2016-18, and to 103 in 2017-19, said the release issued on Monday. With this persistent decline, India was on the verge of achieving the National Health Policy (NHP) target of 100/lakh live births by 2020 and certainly on track to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target of 70/ lakh live births by 2030, it noted.  The number of States that have achieved the SDG target has now risen from five to seven -- Kerala (30), Maharashtra (38), Telangana (56), Tamil Nadu (58), Andhra Pradesh (58), Jharkhand (61), and Gujarat (70). There are now nine States that have achieved the MMR target set by the NHP, which include the above seven and Karnataka (83) and Haryana (96). Uttarakhand (101), West Bengal (109), Punjab (114), Bihar (130), Odisha (136) and Rajasthan (141) -- have the MMR in between 100-150, while Chhattisgarh (160), Madhya Pradesh (163), Uttar Pradesh (167) and Assam (205) have the MMR above 150.

In a release issued on Monday, the Union Health Ministry said the decision was taken after due deliberations with scientific bodies. The vaccine to be administered would be Corbevax, manufactured by Biological E. Limited, Hyderabad. Those above 14 years are already being administered COVID-19 vaccine.  The announcement brought mixed reaction from the medical fraternity. Dr. J.P. Muliyil, epidemiologist at CMC Vellore and a member of the working group of National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) said there had to be tangible benefits of the vaccine. “In case of children, COVID-19 infection has so far proven to be non-serious and those infected have shown to have good natural immunity. There then seems to be no logical reason for vaccinating children,” he stated.  Omicron, which had infected a large section of the population including children, seems to have passed on lasting natural immunity that leaves us in a robust state, he added.  The Ministry has also decided that the condition of comorbidity for COVID-19 precaution dose for the population of over 60 years will be removed from March 16.  Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya tweeted in Hindi stating that if the children were safe, then the country was safe. “I am happy to inform that the COVID vaccination of children in the age group of 12 to 13 and 13 to 14 is starting from March 16. Also, everyone aged 60 years and above will now be able to get precaution doses,” he stated. He urged the families of children and people in the age group of 60 and above to get the vaccination done.  Dr. Gauri Agarwal, founder-director, Seeds of Innocence and Genestrings Diagnostics, said the government’s decision was a positive step as most schools across the country have opened and children started taking offline classes.  “The third wave of coronavirus has passed and adult vaccination rates are rapidly approaching their full potential. In this scenario, vaccinating children will aid in the fight against future COVID-19 outbreaks. This will boost herd immunity, protecting people with a weak immune system. The success rate of the vaccination of children, which will begin on March 16, will be used to determine whether children under the age of 12 should be vaccinated. More research will be needed to evaluate whether or not children under the age of 12 need the vaccine,’’ she explained. Meanwhile, India reported 2,503 new COVID-19 cases in the last 24 hours, making it the lowest in 680 days so far.  “With this, India’s active caseload at 36,168 becomes lowest in 675 days. Active cases now constitute 0.08% of the country’s total positive cases. Consequently, India’s recovery rate stands at 98.72%. Also 4,377 patients have recovered in the last 24 hours and the cumulative tally of recovered patients (since the beginning of the pandemic) is now at 4,24,41,449.

Currently there are about 8,675 PMBJP Kendras that have been opened in districts across the country with three IT enabled warehouses functional at Gurugram, Chennai and Guwahati and fourth one is ready to start operations at Surat. The government has also set a target to increase the number of PMBJKs to 10,500 by the end of March 2025 along with a total of six warehouses. Further, 39 distributors have been appointed across the country to support the supply of medicines to remote and rural areas, said an official at Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers. “Point-of-Sale application for value added services has been implemented by Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Bureau of India (PMBI) to monitor end-to-end supply chain management system. All warehouses have SAP-based inventory management system and the demand forecasting is done through the said system so as to place orders as per the desired inventory levels,’’ he added. Under the PMBJP being implemented by the Department of Pharmaceuticals, a medicine is priced on the principle of maximum of 50% of average price of the top three brands of the said medicine. Thus, the prices of Jan Aushadhi Medicines are cheaper at least by 50% and in some cases, by 80% to 90% of the market price of the branded medicines. In India, National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority under the Department of Pharmaceuticals regulates the prices of all drugs – whether branded or generic. While it fixes the ceiling price of scheduled medicines specified in the first schedule of the Drugs (Prices Control) Order, 2013, in case of non-scheduled medicines, the manufactures are free to fix Maximum Retail Price (MRP) of the drug. However, DPCO provides that the same do not increase by more than 10% of their MRP during the preceding twelve months.  Meanwhile, giving information about how the Kendras did during the COVID-19 pandemic the Central government said that in spite of problems in procurement and logistics due to lockdown the Kendras delivered a record ₹ 52 crore worth of affordable and quality medicines to the public during April 2020. This led to total savings of approximately ₹ 300 crore of common citizens as Jan Aushdhi Kendra’s medicines are cheaper by 50 to 90% of the average market price .”In its fight against COVID-19, over 900 quality generic-medicines and 154 surgical equipment and consumable was available at affordable prices,’’ it added. In the financial year 2020-21, Bureau of Pharma PSUs of India clocked sales turnover of ₹665.83 crore despite the lock down and testing times. This, according to the Ministry, has led to savings of approximately ₹ 4,000 crores of the common citizens of the country. “PMBJKs, BPPI, distributors and other stakeholders came together to work against the current wave of COVID-19 pandemic,” added a senior official at the Ministry.

293,"March 12, 2022",18:00 IST,sci-tech,health,Children more unlikely to produce antibodies," A small study involving 108 participants — 57 children and 51 adults — found that compared with adults, a higher proportion of children did not produce antibodies in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection (seroconversion). All the 108 participants were either asymptomatic or had only mild symptoms. The lack of antibodies in children becomes particularly stark as both adults and children had comparable viral load.  The study was carried out between May 10 and October 28, 2020 at the Royal Children’s Hospital, Melbourne, Australia. The study looked at the ability of adults and children to produce antibodies when infected with the Wuhan strain of the virus. Whether children would exhibit the same characteristics in the case of the Delta and Omicron variants, where people tend to have far higher viral loads, is not known.  The study recruited children and adults infected with SARS-CoV-2 and their household members, and samples were collected from the throat and nose to detect the virus; blood samples were collected to measure humoral responses.  The results were published in the journal JAMA Network Open. Using three serological assays, the team of researchers led by Paul V. Licciardi from the Royal Children’s Hospital found that only 20 of 54 children produced antibodies on being infected, compared with 32 of 42 adults. This was despite the viral load being comparable. The mean cycle threshold (Ct) value for adults was 24.1 while it was 28.5 in the case of children. The smaller the Ct value, the higher is the viral load. However, the researchers say that when the Ct value was less than 26, both adults — 10 of 11 (90.9%) — and children — 12 of 15 (80%) developed antibodies. “The findings of this cohort study suggest that among patients with mild COVID-19, children may be less likely to have seroconversion than adults despite similar viral loads. This finding has implications for future protection after SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and for interpretation of serosurveys that involve children,” they write. One reason why 34 children did not develop antibodies despite being infected could be because children have been found to mount a “stronger and faster response” to infection than adults. That would mean that children are able to clear the virus so quickly that the immune system is not triggered to produce antibodies against the virus. So in the absence of antibodies, it is not clear if these children would be protected against reinfection.  The authors found that a higher proportion of adults who did not develop antibodies were asymptomatic — four of 10 (40%). In contrast, adults who had symptoms had greater possibility of developing antibodies. In the case of children, a higher proportion of children who had antibodies did not have any symptoms on infection compared with children who did not develop antibodies. “This outcome suggests that the host humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is different in adults despite similar viral loads and exposure to circulating virus variants,” they write.  One reason why children are able to clear the virus without even producing antibodies may be because unlike adults, children have a more robust innate and/or mucosal immune response to the virus. The faster clearance of the virus by children could be again because children have a robust innate immune response than adults. But the authors were not able to confirm these statements in the study.  It was previously shown that adults who did not have antibodies were 80% more susceptible to getting reinfected compared with adults who developed antibodies. Even when adults developed antibodies, the risk of reinfection was higher when the level of antibodies was low. But even antibody levels were low, adults who were reinfected had lower viral load than adults who did not have antibodies and got reinfected.  “Therefore, a lack of seroconversion [lack of antibodies] may result in a higher susceptibility to reinfection. This hypothesis may have important implications on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the community and the public health response,” they write.",R.

294,"March 12, 2022",16:38 IST,sci-tech,health,More Than Just Surgery: Life lessons beyond the O.T. review: The healing touch," For reasons unknown, until recently, there were relatively few autobiographies by pathbreaking Indian doctors. Ergo, this memoir by Tehemton Udwadia is a most welcome one. Udwadia has been a general and gastrointestinal surgeon in Mumbai for about six decades. It would not be an exaggeration to state that almost every Indian surgeon (and doctors from other fields) are aware of him and his achievements — he is, after all the pioneer of laparoscopic surgery in India. Laparoscopic surgery forms an important part of this book, which has been written for a general readership, but there is more than just that.  Essential lessons  ​Udwadia follows a fairly linear account of the first half of his captivating life​ before going on to elaborate on his crusade for laparoscopic surgery and using it as a springboard for his views on surgical health care, especially of impoverished citizens of our country. Indeed, the last four chapters of this book stand out and could well be read by young impressionable people in any field, for the lessons they impart. After all, the five essential requirements to make a good surgeon (honesty, humility, empathy, passion, leadership), as well as many aphorisms, apply to all branches of medicine and life. This, of course, is in the background of immense dedication — he informs us that at the beginning of his surgical career, he took thread from the operation theatre and tied knots on his chair at home till “my fingers couldn't move and the back of the chair looked like a white wig”. The relevance of research — much neglected in India — and the need for self-reliant thinking is a constant mantra.  Some incidents stand out, like his father, a GP (and his role model), illustrating by example, the importance of finding the fine balance of maintaining a patient's self-respect while coming to his succour. Udwadia’s puckish sense of humour is revealed in an episode with a surgeon with a colonial mindset in England.  Importance of mentors  The importance of mentors is crystal clear as Udwadia explains repeatedly how his stints with Dr. Prafulla Kumar Sen, the cardiac surgeon at KEM Hospital in Bombay in the 1950s and 1960s changed his life. On his part, he is generous when he doles out credit to his family, colleagues and his students (many of whom he names) for his successes. More importantly, he doesn’t name those (even though many have now passed away) who condemned him for his unconventional views, which are now known to have been right.  I would have liked to know more. There is no mention of his being awarded the Padma Shri and later, the Padma Bhushan — or indeed, the OBE. What were the difficulties that he faced in dealing with the bureaucracy in a public hospital? How did he tackle them? As perhaps happens with most such books, I believe that a medical audience would appreciate it better. There are phrases (such as honorary surgeon — a term possibly unique to the teaching system in Mumbai) which would leave the lay reader askance. Despite these minor foibles, More Than Just Surgery is a perfect example of what Longfellow informs us, that lives of great men can inspire us to leave footprints on the sands of time.

Thirteen years later in 2005-06, the State’s TFR had dipped below replacement (the rate at which the population replaces itself) at 2.1. It further dipped to 1.8 in 2015-16 and 1.7 in 2019-21 signifying that the fertility drop has not levelled off yet, according to observations made in the Karnataka Economic Survey 2021-22, which was released recently. With the percentage of registration for both births and deaths increasing across India, the steep fertility decline is consistent. Data from the survey revealed that the estimated births and gross of infant mortality deaths is stagnating for the last five years, and possibly declining. The total number of deaths in the country is also increasing. “In Karnataka, the total number of births is reducing in line with fertility having dropped to 1.7 in 2019-21, and possibly 1.5 by 2030. It is very clear that the number of deaths is increasing quite dramatically. If the estimated births decrease by 1% every year — in 2030, the number of actual births could be 10.2 lakh. However, the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of deaths is almost 7%, which means the number of deaths in 2030 will be close to 12 lakh, overtaking the number of births, leading to a population decline. A detailed analysis is required to create a demographic profile of the State till 2030, so that appropriate targeted policies can be evaluated,” according to findings of the survey.  “Crucially, India’s TFR has plummeted over three decades, and the Indian population is officially below replacement. Global consensus has placed the replacement rate for emerging economies at 2.3, and for the developed world at 2.1. India’s latest TFR, according to National Family Health Survey - 5 (NFHS-5), is 2.0, coming under both replacement rates (of emerging economies and developed world), and officially signifying the country’s high population growth trajectory is over and the population will peak soon,” according to the survey report. T.V. Sekher, Professor and Head, Department of Family and Generations, International Institute of Population Sciences, Mumbai, said “South Indian States are in an advanced stage of demographic transition whereas several States, such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, are still behind. The declining TFR trend is expected. We do not need any policy to bring down fertility,” he asserted. Pointing out that the number of senior citizens will increase multifold in a couple of decades and social security will be essential, Dr. Sekher said: “We are in the stage of reaping from India’s demographic dividend provided we develop a highly skilled and productive workforce and give them employment opportunities to keep the economic momentum going. This is a big challenge for the country.” “In many urban areas, people are following a single child policy even without any incentives or rules. The general feeling is to have one child and give the child better education. This is mainly because there is no time for child care with both parents working and not because of economic reasons,” he explained. Antony K. R., public health consultant and Independent Monitor, National Health Mission, said Karnataka’s TFR of 1.7 is closely following the trend in other progressive States, like Kerala, Telangana and Tamil Nadu. “The declining TFR is a welcome trend till it reaches the replacement population level. Demographic stabilisation is a sign of a progressive State,” he said. “Reduction in TFR is largely due to women’s changing roles, expansion of women’s education, employment shifts, such as more women entering salaried jobs, advances in reproductive health,  decreasing child mortality and assurance of child survival,” he pointed out.",Afshan Yasmeen,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/in-2030-deaths-in-karnataka-will-be-12-lakh-and-births-only-102-lakh/article65204983.ece

Given the slow and steady rise in breast and cervical cancer cases, the focus now turns to the absence of sustained measures to create awareness. While breast cancer is more popular, the malady affecting the genital tract is categorised into cervical cancer, endometrial cancer and ovarian cancer. The primary reason for the rise in cases is the general misapprehension that cancer occurs only in the later stages of life, but the instances of the disease attacking young women, including adolescent, unmarried women and lactating mothers, have shattered the myth. Women Doctors’ Wing (WDW), a unit of Indian Medical Association’s (IMA), is working on a project to create awareness, prevention, screening and early detection of breast and cervical cancer. The project is named ‘SWAYAM’ as it encourages self-examination by women. “Breast cancer can be easily tracked by palpating every part of the breast and checking for painful/painless lumps, if any”, says P. Krishna Prasanthi, a national committee member of WDW. Similarly, cervical cancer can occur even without any perceptible symptoms like abdominal swelling, pain in the abdomen or altered menstrual cycle. In case of known indications, Dr.Prasanthi suggests women to approach a gynaecologist for proper diagnosis.  There is also not much awareness on the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine that prevents up to 90% of infection that can cause cancer or genital warts. “A few educated women are coming forward, but not those from rural areas have the faintest of idea. Apart from lack of awareness, it is the prohibitive cost that is a barrier”, observes B. Nirmala Devi, a senior obstetrician and gynaecologist of Tirupati. As the vaccine has to be taken before marriage, preferably in the adolescent age, the focus is on creating strong women and ensure a productive life. Anaemia is another disorder that casts a shadow on women’s physical and emotional well-being. “The government is supplying iron tablets that reach the rural women through the ASHA network, but not many women take it seriously”, rues Dr. Nirmala.  eom",A.D.

In a statement, WHO said its expert group concluded that immunisation with authorised COVID-19 vaccines provide high levels of protection against severe disease and death amid the global circulation of the hugely contagious omicron variant. It said vaccination, including the use of boosters, was especially important for people at risk of severe disease. Last year, WHO's director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called for a moratorium on booster doses while dozens of countries embarked on administering the doses, saying rich countries should immediately donate those vaccines to poor countries instead. WHO scientists said at the time they would continue to evaluate incoming data. Numerous scientific studies have since proven that booster doses of authorized vaccines help restore waning immunity and protect against serious COVID-19. Booster programs in rich countries including Britain, Canada and the U.S. have been credited with preventing the surge in omicron infections from spilling over into hospitals and cemeteries. WHO said it is continuing to monitor the global spread of omicron, including a “stealth” version known as BA.2, which has been documented to have re-infected some people after an initial case of omicron. There's mixed research on whether it causes more severe disease, but vaccines appear just as effective against it. WHO noted that the current authorized COVID-19 vaccines are all based on the strain that was first detected in Wuhan, China more than three years ago. “Since then, there has been continuous and substantial virus evolution and it is likely that this evolution will continue, resulting in the emergence of new variants,” the agency said. It added that coronavirus vaccines would likely need to be updated. ",AP,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/who-says-covid-boosters-needed-reversing-previous-call/article65204749.ece

Initiated by social entrepreneur Lakshmi Menon, the project connects and opens private restrooms across Kerala aimed primarily at women travellers.  Lakshmi says she got the idea on a solo car drive, Traveli (Travel + Maveli) in August 2021, when the lockdown was lifted temporarily during the pandemic to encourage hyperlocal tourism. She found a dearth of clean, safe and accessible restrooms on her journey covering over 400 kilometres in five days from Kochi to Kozhikode and return to Alappuzha. Realising a network of private homes and properties that offer their clean washrooms for travellers would be a practical and easy solution, she decided to work on setting up a ‘Pay and Use model.’ To do this, she contacted beauty parlours, supermarkets and friends, sharing the idea and enlisting the interested.  Around 15 properties have joined so far and more enquiries are coming in as the idea gains momentum. Prashanth K Nellickal and wife Sreedevi Padmaja were one of the first to join the project, after being inspired by Lakshmi’s social media campaigns. (In 2018 Lakshmi co-founded the Chekutty dolls and in 2014, she organised grandmothers in old age homes to make wicks for oil lamps, in a project called ‘Ammoomma thiri’. )  The Thiruvananthapuram-based couple have an organic store, Organogram that’s run by a team of women. “Being development professionals we travel a lot and have faced this issue first hand. I have always found my mother and wife not drinking water before a road trip, afraid that they will not find a clean toilet,” says Prashanth, who has not only thrown open the store toilet to travellers but is also preparing to add a baby station to the facility.   The next step was to reach this data to travelling women. First, she contemplated investing in an App but that proved expensive. Then she turned to Instagram. “I decided to piggy-back on existing apps,” she says. Her tech-savvy friends volunteered to help create Toil Less (a toil less journey) on Instagram and the handle has 500 followers, before the actual campaign to be launched on March 8, International Womens’ Day. “I wanted the model to be accessible to seniors like my mother who is not tech-savvy but has Instagram,” says Lakshmi, explaining that users can also access it from a link shared on WhatsApp.  A property in the network is marked as a Travel Ally and has the discretion to add facilities like a shower facility, a boutique, plant nursery, free Wi-fi, charging station, a café and such along with the use of the toilet. Users pay a minimum of ₹ 30 and Travel Allies can charge more according to the extra facilities they provide.“It is left to the discretion of property owners to throw it open to all genders,” says Lakshmi explaining that many resorts that have joined the project have separate facilities for men and women.  The process, finally, is in three deliberately simple steps: Locate a guaranteed clean toilet, pay and use it, and also use any extra facilities like baby care station or a feeding room it offers. She believes that partnering can be a business for entrepreneurs, who can lease a toilet complex and run it. Lakshmi has also roped in “dormant resources” like wedding auditoriums and convention halls in the network. Many resorts from Vagamon and Peermade in Idukki are part of the project, and  “more are joining,” she says excitedly.

299,"March 05, 2022",19:47 IST,sci-tech,health,The role Fusobacterium plays in oral cancer patients in India," Since the beginning of the 20th Century, it is known that infections could play a role in cancer, with 18-20% of cancers associated with infectious agents. This could be relatively higher in developing countries like India. Our team at ACTREC-Tata Memorial Centre developed a highly sensitive and specific automated computational tool HPVDetector to quantify the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV). This was done by subtracting human sequences from the cancer genome and comparing the rest with the HPV genome to identify the presence of HPV sequence trace and determine the range of all co-infecting HPV strains in the same individual.  The analysis revealed significant occurrence of HPV 16, 18, and 31, among others, in cervical cancer. But a surprising finding was that Indian patients with oral tumours showing a distinct tobacco usage gene signature were devoid of HPV infection. This was in sharp contrast to the oral tumours among Caucasian patients, wherein tobacco genetic signature is not common but is marked by a significant presence of HPV. Several groups have corroborated this finding, and it is well established that oral tumours among Indian patients are not driven by HPV infection. In this study published on Mar 4, in NAR Cancer, Sanket Desai, the lead researcher from the group, developed another advanced automated computational tool — Infectious Pathogen Detector (IPD). Beyond HPV, IPD can detect the presence of 1,058 pathogens in the human cancer genome from datasets generated from any Next Generation Sequencing platform. This tool is publicly available for download from the ACTREC- TMC website. Using IPD, the DNA and RNA sequence from 1,407 cancer samples of oral, breast, cervical, gall bladder, lung and colorectal tumours derived from Indians were analysed and compared with Caucasian patients.  This has led to establishing the most detailed map of the abundance of 1,058 microbes present across Indian cancer patients. Rigorous statistical measures were adopted to distinguish the commensal microbes present as normal flora in a healthy individual compared with the diseased state. Systematic analysis of the data helped the group identify the presence of a bacteria, Fusobacterium nucleatum, in the oral tumours at a significantly higher burden than in the oral cavity of healthy individuals.  Interestingly,  Fusobacterium nucleatum is known to play a vital role in colorectal cancer, wherein its presence affects the spread of the disease and the patient's response to chemotherapy. However, a similar role of Fusobacterium in oral cancer was not known earlier. The presence of the bacteria was found in Indian and Caucasian oral cancer patients, with a much higher incidence among the Indian patients. Moreover, oral cancer patients positive for Fusobacterium were found to be negative for HPV infection, suggesting they are present in a mutually exclusive way.  The finding underlines that while oral tumours in the West are more likely to be driven by HPV infection with a lower abundance of Fusobacterium infection, the oral cancer incidences in India are caused more by Fusobacterium infection. The tumours in oral cancer patients infected with the bacterium were found to spread to lymph nodes in the head and neck region or other distant organs. This sub-class of the tumour was also found to have higher levels of genes responsible for inflammation and pro-cancer immunological response.  Consistent with this finding, infection with virus or bacteria causing chronic inflammation leading to cancer has been known across multiple cancer types, such as HPV in cervical cancer, HBV and HCV in liver cancer, H. pylori in gastric cancer, etc. This study also identified three novel small non-coding miRNA molecules among tumours infected with the bacteria. The discovery of these miRNAs allows the investigators to understand the biological pathway targeted by the  Fusobacteria, when it infects the oral cells, and its detailed characterisation. The study continues in collaboration with IIT Bombay, where the researchers grow the oral cancer cells in the presence and absence of the bacterium. Preventing cancer through immunisation against infectious agents such as HPV vaccination has been known to be effective in up to 90% of HPV-related cancers. Similarly, a significant reduction was observed in the incidence of gastric cancer across multiple studies when the patients infected with the bacteria, Helicobacterium pylori, were treated with antibiotics specific to the bacterium. The findings from the study carried out at ACTREC- Tata Memorial Centre opens an opportunity to treat oral cancer patients positive for Fusobacterium, occurring predominantly among Indian patients, with a Fusobacterium-specific antibiotic for selectively targeting the tumours. The study emphasises the impact of Fusobacterium infection on modulating conventional chemotherapy treatment or recurrence of the disease as frequently observed in oral cancer patients, similar to its role in colorectal cancer. The utility of community screening for the presence of Fusobacterium in the oral cavity in a population or among habitual tobacco chewers remains to be explored — though it could be a worthy exercise considering the alarming increase in tobacco-associated oral cancer in India.

300,"March 05, 2022",16:28 IST,sci-tech,health,"Dreadful Diseases in Colonial Bengal: Cholera, Malaria and Smallpox review: Lessons from a colonial past"," It was still early days of the pandemic. The virus was spreading fast, even as scientists were struggling to understand the new contagion. Isolation, quarantine, social (or physical) distancing — and lockdowns — were beginning to become part of our lexicon, and existence.  For at least one public health expert, the (initial) response to the new contagion seemed rather “medieval”. Despite scientific progress, all we can do is shut everything down, and isolate ourselves, she said. Indeed, we had been here before. Measures such as isolating sick patients were deployed as far back as in the late 19th century Bengal to contain infectious diseases such as smallpox. These control measures were outlined in the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 — an act that has been invoked through the pandemic.  Eerie parallels  But the parallels don’t end there. Dreadful Diseases in Colonial Bengal: Cholera, Malaria and Smallpox, edited by Suranjan Das and Achintya Kumar Dutta, is a sobering reminder also of the patterns of public health crisis that have plagued India. The book is third in a documentation project on ‘Western medicine and indigenous society: History of Disease, medicine and public health in Colonial Eastern India (1757-1947)‘; the first was on the context in which hospitals were established in Calcutta during the British East India company’s rule, while the second focused on TB in 20th century India.  By examining public health records (1926-1942) from the three epidemics (mentioned in the book’s title), Das and Dutta bring to the fore the public health crisis in Bengal primarily due to colonial apathy, and the toll it took on the local people. As epidemic after epidemic raged across colonial Bengal, issues such as lack of enough hospital beds, fewer doctors and nurses, poor allocation of funds for public health (despite huge revenues accrued by the colonial government), shortages of essential drugs (such as quinine used to treat malaria) and an inequitable access to health services, meant thousands of lives were lost. What is striking is that some of the major public health challenges as laid bare by the three epidemics then — and a pandemic now — have persisted. For instance, similar chaotic scenes of lack of hospital beds, medicines and oxygen were witnessed in India during the second wave of COVID-19.  The authors argue that the basic fallacy of colonial policy was the ‘band-aid’ approach taken by the administration to deal with the deadly diseases. “Certain preventive and curative measures were adopted only when epidemics broke out, instead of adopting long-term anti-epidemic policies, or public health development schemes,” they write of the time. Basic sanitary schemes proposed by British experts to help tackle malaria were disregarded by the colonial government, citing a lack of funds. Records from the time also suggest that the vaccination programme to prevent smallpox, too, posed several challenges such as vaccine hesitancy, an urban bias in coverage, and the local populace’s preference for indigenous medicine. Of course, India has overcome many of these issues, its (paediatric) vaccination programme is often cited as a success story. But even so, when it came to delivering COVID-19 vaccines to its adult population, supply bottlenecks due to faulty planning led to inordinate delays.  The pandemic has been a wake-up call for us to address the larger questions of inequities, and push for investment in affordable, quality healthcare systems. As this book shows, history won’t judge us kindly if we don’t make the right choices.

301,"March 04, 2022",12:06 IST,sci-tech,health,Breathless: Silicosis is killing workers in Jharkhand," For five years, Taramani Karmkar, 45, from Galudi village, East Singhbhum district in Jharkhand, worked in a factory (now shut down) that manufactured insulators used in electric poles. Every day, she would gather the silica dust — a by-product of manufacturing — and dispose of it and then clean the factory floor. On the morning of January 25, Taramani died of silicosis. Her sister-in-law Chinta Karmkar, who worked in the same factory, and her brother, had died of the same disease a few years ago. Today, Sanatan Gope, 35, who worked in the packaging unit of another factory in Musabani village in the same district for six years, is fighting for his life. He says he has trouble breathing and has severe chest pain while talking. Silicosis is a chronic respiratory ailment caused by inhaling silica dust over a long period of time. Silica is the most abundant mineral compound of sand and many types of rock; silicosis develops when fragments of silica, smaller than 0.5 microns, are inhaled or ingested during silica mining or while working in factories that use silica. The particles get embedded in the alveoli and accumulate in the lungs and respiratory passages causing a thickening of the lungs; symptoms include tightness of chest and shortness of breath. Without protective gear East Singhbhum district, where Taramani used to work, is one of the regions in Jharkhand ravaged by silicosis, with some half a dozen villages here severely affected. While the government has not documented every individual who has died of silicosis, according to Samit Kumar Carr, General Secretary of Occupational Safety & Health Association of Jharkhand (OSHAJ), an organisation that works on this issue, over 10,000 people have died of silicosis in the last two decades, almost all of them belonging to tribal and backward communities.  Jharkhand, rich in more than 30 minerals such as coal, cobalt, graphite and silica, contributes significantly to the nation’s economy. As for industrial silica, it is used in a wide array of industries, the main ones being glass foundries, construction, ceramics, and chemicals. Sports and leisure facilities also use silica, and it is a raw material for silicon metal. But workers in Jharkhand’s mines remain largely neglected. In fact, wages in these industries are so low that workers are unable to afford health checks and X-rays. “I worked in the production and packaging line of a ramming mass factory for a few years, and I’ve been having respiratory problems since the beginning, but I didn’t pay attention,” says Gope. “We were not provided with any kind of protective equipment; several of my colleagues have this disease. It has affected my entire family.” 200 of 500 dead According to Carr, every worker in this sector is impacted by the disease, and anyone affected by it is almost certain to die. Despite this, the government lacks a mechanism to stop or mitigate the scourge of silicosis. With the support of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and the court, OSHAJ tries to provide compensation to the affected people and their families. “Most companies in the sector are named after gods — Krishna and Krishna Minerals, Gajanan Minerals, Chandrika Minerals, Ambika Minerals, Balakrishna Minerals, and Kali Maa Minerals — but work in this sector is killing the workers,” says Carr.  A silica ramming unit was launched in Musabani in East Singhbhum in 2008. This unit, affiliated to the factory Taramani worked in, is also shut now, but used to employ some 500 people from Ghatshila, Musabani, Dumaria and other villages. Of them, more than 200 workers are now dead and several more have silicosis. Most companies and factory owners, however, are not concerned about workplace safety or health. Even trade unions don’t pay attention to the issue, the majority being solely concerned with salaries and incentives. Not on record East Singhbhum Additional District Magistrate (Law and Order) Nandkishore Lal, talking to the media in January had said, “If the relatives of the person who died of silicosis complain at the right time, then we can investigate.” But in reality, silicosis deaths aren’t even counted in government figures. Doctors are hesitant to use the term ‘silicosis’ in their reports even if the diagnosis confirms the disease.  According to Carr, many of the doctors in the area, who are hired on contract basis, are ordered not to use the word ‘silicosis’ because it could put several government departments in the dock: the Department of Health, the Department of Industries, and the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board. The medical term used instead is ‘industrial dust disease and not tuberculosis’. In 2009, the Supreme Court issued an interim order directing the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Labour and Employment to provide all necessary assistance to the NHRC for any silicosis-related action. According to the ruling, the NHRC could also investigate proven cases of silicosis and recommend emergency medical help. The NHRC can help in providing compensation to the family of the deceased. In 2010, the Jharkhand government established a cell to identify patients with silicosis. An X-ray machine was installed in a government hospital in Dumka. Ultimately, this cell did not take off.  This January, the Jharkhand government has approved the Factory Silicosis Beneficiary Assistance Scheme to provide compensation to factory workers who suffer from silicosis and to the dependents of workers who have died of silicosis. Taramani died before this could be implemented. The Jharkhand government’s January initiative is admirable, but prevention is more important. Entrepreneurs must develop dust management systems and pollution control equipment in silica industries.  It is clear that the only way to eliminate silicosis is through new safety technologies. According to WHO, in countries such as the U.S., where such measures have been taken, the incidence of silicosis has decreased dramatically. And it is for the State to provide financial assistance to private entities that can create protective dust-proof equipment that stop particles as small as 0.5 microns. “If we want to eliminate silicosis from the root, we have to work towards automating the silica industry. Manual work will have to be stopped completely,” says Carr. “Meanwhile, the government must mandate dust-pollution control equipment, supervisors, and safety inspectors to make the workplace safer.” The writer is an independent journalist and a student at Delhi University.",Vikram Raj,https://www.thehindu.com/society/theres-a-scourge-of-silicosis-among-mine-and-factory-workers-in-jharkhand/article65092384.ece

The Health Ministry noted that the India currently is in a positive stage when compared to other countries. Mr. Aggarwal said, “With 11,302 average cases reported in the week ending March 1, India contributed to only 0.7% of global cases. Only a single State has over 10,000 active cases and two States have between 5,000 to 10,000 active cases. Remaining States have less than 5,000 active cases. Kerala, Maharashtra, Mizoram accounts for 50% of active cases of the country,’’ he said.
He further explained that a continuous decrease in cases across the world has been recorded and India reported a sharp decline of 96.4% in the number of cases as compared to the world average of 55.7%. “The overall spread during the third surge was 42 days as compared to the overall spread of 117 days during the second surge of COVID. India reported a sharp decline in deaths reported (76.6%) as compared to the world (22.8%),’’ said Mr. Aggarwal.

It could be due to higher infection rate or increased testing, but there is no denying that health authorities there had access to precise data about the virus, thanks to efficient sewage surveillance. “We have tied up with the local municipal authorities and other scientific institutions to monitor samples from the sewage treatment plants and wastewater flows to check the infection rate. It is possible to deduce the possible peak or plateau in cases at least a week in advance for the government to make decisions on imposing or lifting curbs,” says Tata Institute for Genetics and Society (TIGS) director Rakesh Mishra. Sewage surveillance would help in public health responses and preventive care like technological tools used to forecast cyclones and monsoons, helping the governments protect millions of lives and avoid enormous economic loss. “The best part is with a small investment, we can have amazing results with non-obtrusive, non-invasive methods like blood samples or the likes,” he points out, in an exclusive interaction.  The former CSIR-CCMB director is quite convinced that the “next big public health issue” will be ‘antibiotic resistance’ among the population, and calls for “proper watch before it explodes” . “Sewage surveillance can be a very effective component and is going to be the future model not only for the COVID pandemic but also in forecasting the next pandemic or even major infectious disease outbreak at the population level,” he explains.  Mr. Mishra, credited to have initiated many COVID research projects in testing, surveillance, diagnostics, vaccines and others, now shuttles between both institutes, for his own research and to guide PhD students at his lab in CCMB.

There is great scope for solving problems like identifying, early intervention and treating rare genetic diseases by collaborating with institutions like CCMB along with clinical partners in finding affordable genetic testing protocols. “With effective screening, prenatal testing and counselling, we can think of eliminating such diseases in two generations,” he says.  “We are also exploring traditional knowledge by modern scientific validation approach for eco-friendly and effective control of the vector-borne diseases instead of taking up intrusive technologies,” adds Mr Mishra.",V.

The meeting was aimed at agreeing on ways of working and timelines for a “convention, agreement or other international instrument” to prevent further pandemics and to improve the preparedness and response in case of its occurrence.  In December 2021, the World Health Assembly agreed to start a global process to draft the pandemic treaty. The need for an updated set of rules was felt after the COVID-19 pandemic exposed the shortcomings of global health systems. The Health Assembly adopted a decision titled “The World Together” at its second special session since it was founded in 1948.  Under the decision, the health organisation established an intergovernmental negotiating body (INB) to draft and negotiate the contents of the pandemic treaty in compliance with Article 19 of the WHO Constitution. The pandemic treaty is expected to cover aspects like data sharing and genome sequencing of emerging viruses and equitable distribution of vaccines and drugs and related research throughout the world. Solutions to the COVID-19 pandemic have seen an inequitable distribution of vaccines so far, with poorer countries at the mercy of others to receive preventive medication. Most countries have followed the “me-first” approach which is not an effective way to deal with a global pandemic, WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement.  The European Union (EU) also wants a ban on wildlife markets to be included in the treaty. A widely-accepted theory points that the novel coronavirus may have jumped from animals to humans in a wildlife market of China.  While the EU wants the treaty to be legally binding, the U.S., Brazil and India have expressed reservations about the same. The legal nature of the treaty is yet to be defined. Article 19 of the WHO Constitution gives the World Health Assembly the authority to adopt conventions or agreements on matters of health. A two-third majority is needed to adopt such conventions or agreements. The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control was set up under Article 19 and it came into force in 2005.  More than 437 million COVID-19 cases have been globally reported so far, and more than 5.9 million people have lost their lives. In India, over 34 million cases have been reported so far. Death toll stands at over five lakh.  The INB held its first meeting on February 24, 2022. The second meeting, where the members are expected to discuss the progress on a working draft, is scheduled to be held by August 1, 2022. A progress report is expected to be delivered to the 76 th World Health Assembly in 2023, and its outcome will be submitted to the 77 th World Health Assembly in 2024 for consideration.

305,"March 01, 2022",14:12 IST,sci-tech,health,A math model to predict COVID-19 vaccine efficacy,"  The protection offered by vaccination has been touted as a major factor in reducing the damage caused by the third wave of Covid-19 infections. Several vaccines offer a high degree of protection, with some reducing the number of symptomatic infections by over 95% in clinical trials. But what determines the extent of protection. Researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc.) and Queensland Brain Institute (QBI) in Australia have addressed this question by developing a mathematical model that predicts how antibodies generated by COVID-19 vaccines confer protection against symptomatic infections. The study was published in Nature Computational Science.  The researchers first analysed over 80 different neutralising antibodies reported to be generated after vaccination against the surface spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. These antibodies are typically present in the blood for months and prevent virus entry by blocking the spike protein. The researchers hypothesised that these 80 antibodies constitute a ‘landscape’ or ‘shape space’, and each individual produces a unique ‘profile’ of antibodies which is a small, random subset of this landscape.  The team then developed a mathematical model to simulate infections in a virtual patient population of about 3,500 people with different antibody profiles, and to predict how many of them would be protected from symptomatic infection following vaccination. “The reason predicting vaccine efficacies has been hard is that the processes involved are complex and operate at many interconnected levels. Vaccines trigger a number of different antibodies, each affecting virus growth in the body differently. This, in turn, affects the dynamics of the infection and the severity of the associated symptoms. Further, different individuals generate different collections of antibodies and in different amounts,” according to Narendra Dixit, Professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering, IISc., and the senior author of the study. “This diversity of antibody responses was a challenge to comprehend and quantify,” added Pranesh Padmanabhan, Research Fellow at QBI, and the first author of the study.  The model developed by the team was able to predict the level of protection that would be conferred after vaccination based on the antibody ‘profile’ of the individual, and the predictions were found to closely match efficacies reported in clinical trials for all the major approved vaccines.  The researchers also observed that vaccine efficacy was linked to a readily measurable metric called antibody neutralisation titre. This opens up the possibility of using such models to test future vaccines for their efficacy before elaborate clinical trials are launched. Prof. Dixit has, however, said that the study is based on current vaccines, which have been designed to work on the original SARS-CoV-2 strain. “Our formalism is yet to be applied to the new variants, including Omicron, where other arms of the immune system and not just antibodies appear to be contributing to vaccine efficacies. Studies are under way to address this,” he said.

Doctors of the Department of Hand and Reconstructive Microsurgery of the hospital performed neurolysis and nerve transfer that was followed by physiotherapy to help him regain full range of motion. Arumuga Kamalesh, a resident of Madurai, was a State-level gymnastic champion. He sustained a shoulder dislocation during practice in November 2020. Though his coach had reduced the dislocation, he again suffered a dislocation while carrying a pot of water, R. Sridhar, associate professor of the department, said.  He sought treatment at a private hospital where an arthroscopy surgery was performed. “He had sustained nerve injury during the shoulder dislocation. The surgery worsened it. He had a brachial plexus injury. Three nerves in the neck and thoracic spine segment were affected and two were functional. He took up physiotherapy and exercises for eight months but his condition did not improve,” he said. In August 2021, he came to TNGMSSH where doctors evaluated him and suggested surgery. A surgery for nerve transfer was performed on September 1. “We performed neurolysis and nerve transfer (Oberlin I and Somsak procedure) in which we joined the branches of the two functioning nerves to the three affected nerves,” he said. There was significant improvement post-surgery, he said. “He followed up on physiotherapy and exercises, and in five months has regained near normal movement. We have advised him to go slowly and not to be hasty, and take up graded exercises,” Dr. Sridhar said. On follow-up, doctors saw that he had regained near-normal movement. He would require physiotherapy for five to six more months, he said. The entire procedure was covered under the Chief Minister’s Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme. Dr. Sridhar along with G. Karthikeyan of the department of Hand and Reconstructive Microsurgery performed the surgery. Apart from them, Magesh and L. Parthasarathy of the Department of Anaesthesiology were part of the team.

308,"February 26, 2022",16:35 IST,sci-tech,health,The palm oil’s curse on life and the environment," There are moments in life when we have to hold our assumptions to a deeper scrutiny. That is what award-winning journalist Jocelyn Zuckerman has succeeded through her groundbreaking research, compelling the reader to examine the connections between the choices we make at the grocery store that keeps the planet under siege. That palm oil’s overwhelming presence in soap and lipstick to baby formula and dog feed is the cause for persistence of poverty and hunger in other parts of world would unsettle any sane mind.  Having insinuated itself into every facet of our lives over the past few decades, palm oil alone counts for one-third of total global vegetable oil consumption. With annual purchase of 9.2 million metric tonnes in 2019, India is the world’s number-one palm oil importer. Far from being a boon to the world economy, the multi-billion dollar palm oil business has been a bane argues Zuckerman. Our growing appetite has worsened the situation — more forests are cleared for new plantations, forcible evictions have escalated human sufferings; and enhanced carbon emissions remain the resultant outcome. Despite its long-term health and environmental implications, the worrisome aspect is how a lesser-known oil suddenly became an indispensable consumer product. Zuckerman unearths palm oil’s troubled colonial legacy to draw a parallel with its current fetishism, promoted by ruthless industrialisation of modern food systems. With multiple uses and an economic life of a quarter century, palm oil’s productive potential could not escape the attention of maverick George Goldie, credited for securing Nigeria for the Crown, and quirky businessman William Lever, for establishing oil-palm plantations in the Congo. The story of palm oil is the story of colonialism, which is sinister in its present-day design involving armed gangsters, murderous executives, and corrupt politicians, she writes.  Junk food Planet Palm is not only a disturbing expose on contemporary ills associated with the palm oil trade but holds unsuspecting consumers complicit in the corporate monopolisation of a $65 billion global business. Trade liberalisation has contributed to this inconspicuous consumption, easing crossborder peddling of ultra-processed junk foods by multinational companies. “Part of the problem,” explains Zuckerman, “is the sort of nutrient-deficient, heavily processed junk that all of this cheap oil enables.” And land planted with oil palm across the developing world, an estimated 104,000 square miles, is land which is diverted from growing healthy foods. Having travelled across four continents, from Indonesia to Honduras and from Liberia to India, the author is unsparing in her revelations, providing disturbing evidence on the world’s most environmentally damaging product — something most of us unknowingly use every day.  It is an extraordinary work of investigative journalism that will make the discerning reader rush to look differently at the items stacked in her kitchen and bathroom. The collective power of consumer choices is critical to turning things around as incidences of violence against those opposing the industry has grown — half of 212 eco-defenders reported killed in 2019 were opposing palm oil interests. So intimately linked are national economies (those of Malaysia and Indonesia) to the palm oil industry that even the governments remain obliged to defend the commodity.  Shocking move What could be more shocking than the fact that France was diplomatically forced to drop plans for a tax on palm oil in 2016, as the Indonesian government had made it clear that passage of the law might result in the execution of a French citizen then being held in Jakarta on drug-trafficking charges.  Zuckerman provides a compelling account of the darkest underside of late-stage capitalism. While there is no denying that our food systems need overhauling, equally important for consumers is to raise their voices to demand more transparency. She leaves the reader with an optimist note to wean ourselves away from palm oil by using synthetic versions of the oil and convincing companies to adopt no-deforestation policies in their production codes.

309,"February 26, 2022",08:00 IST,sci-tech,health,Does the tougher and larger screen of Apple Watch Series 7 matter?," When Apple launched the Watch Series 7 in October 2021, many expected the smartwatch to have a host of new health-tech features for the user to enjoy. Watch Series 5 introduced an electrocardiogram (ECG) while the Watch Series 6 added a blood-oxygen monitor or pulse oximeter, the latter a fitting feature in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.  But when Apple revealed the hook of the Series 7 would merely be a larger and much more durable display – along with an expected IP6X certification for resistance to dust and a WR50 water resistance rating – many were baffled.  While the overall size of the Watch barely changes, design-wise, it makes sense to increase the screen size – by roughly 20% – to also reduce the size of the surrounding band for a more sleek look. This maximises screen real estate for the Watch versions of an app. After all, the best apps for smartwatches support fast interactions and focus on the content that users care about most, but it is important that the smartwatch design itself supports this.  Place this side-by-side with a previous model and you may notice the user interface has been redesigned to take advantage of the larger size and shape of the new display – it fits more text onscreen, has larger buttons and type sizes (which can be customised in case of accessibility issues), and a QWERTY keyboard.  Ideal smartwatch app design requires careful thought into not just font and image sizes but also negative and/or whitespace. The overall user experience is compromised when there is information overload so often app designers create visual groupings to help users find the information they want. They then use negative space to place related elements and information into distinct areas. So the Series 7 does not just allow for more space for text and other media but also more space for, well, nothing.  During exercise, work or other highly-engaging routines, this hardware design choice helped me focus on the Watch only when I needed to and not for an exhaustive amount of time. It retained its placement in my offline and online routines as little more than an accessory that I rely upon to track my health through the day and night.  Having used the Watch Series 7 for some time now, the stronger, more crack-resistant front crystal barely has a crack whereas I experienced minor crack lines with its two predecessors. For a small screen, even the smallest scratch can ruin the user experience. Users of the SE and the Series 3 to Series 6 most likely invested in a wraparound screen-guard or a tempered glass, but the Series 7’s durability negated that need.  Apple took similar efforts with its smartphones starting with the iPhone 12 series’ Ceramic Shield; in May 2021, Apple awarded US$45 million from its Advanced Manufacturing Fund to Corning Incorporated, a supplier of precision glass for iPhone, Watch, and iPad.  According to Apple, Ceramic Shield was enabled by a high-temperature crystallisation step which forms nano-crystals within the glass matrix. These specialised crystals are kept small enough that the material is transparent. Therefore, the resulting material makes up the Ceramic Shield, which is reported to be stronger than Corning’s Gorilla Glass Victus. Perhaps Apple’s strategy here was to mark the world’s desire to return to a more outdoorsy and physical lifestyle after being homebound for almost two years. Coming with the territory of engaging in outdoors activity comes the hazard of falling over, bumping against other elements, and so on. The Watch Series 7 is the intersection of both these conundrums, attaining the added perk of a hardy device that does not have the rugged and somewhat chunky look of a Garmin or an Instinct.  So, what would the Apple Series 8 (if that is what it will be called) offer?  The Apple Watch Series 7 starts at ₹41,900. It can be purchased from Apple’s official online store, or in-person at third-party authorised resellers. ",Divya Kala Bhavani,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/does-the-tougher-and-larger-screen-of-apple-watch-series-7-matter/article65085065.ece
310,"February 21, 2022",22:32 IST,sci-tech,health,What is Lassa fever and should you be worried?," The story so far: One death out of the three confirmed cases of the viral Lassa fever in the United Kingdom has sparked concerns about the spread of the disease, even as the world continues to grapple with the Covid-19 pandemic. The U.K. Health Security Agency confirmed the death on February 11. The two initial cases were detected within the same family of East England that had travelled to West Africa.  The disease was discovered in 1969 in Nigeria’s Lassa town. Two missionary nurses died after contracting the virus, although similar symptoms had been described since the 1950s.  The World Health Organisation defines Lassa fever as an animal-borne acute viral haemorrhagic fever caused by multimammate rats. Cases of the disease are mostly reported from Benin, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone, Togo and Nigeria in West Africa and the disease is largely endemic to the region. Thousands of cases of Lassa fever are reported from West Africa each year, with an annual casualty count averaging 5,000.  Eight cases of Lassa fever have been reported in the U.K. since 1980. The last two cases until now were reported in 2009.  In the U.S., only six cases of Lassa fever have been reported so far, and all of them were associated with travel to countries where the disease is endemic.  The primary cause of Lassa fever is exposure to the infected multimammate rats. Lassa virus spreads through faeces and urine of these rats. Exposure of food and household items to the virus is also considered a leading cause for the spread of the disease. The Mastomys rats are known for living in human settlements, thus increasing chances of exposure to the virus through food. The rodents also serve as a source of food themselves. The virus can also infect humans if air contaminated by the excretion of infected rats is inhaled.  Human-to-human transmission of the virus is also possible, although it is not known to spread through casual contact like hugging, shaking hands or sitting near an infected person. Chances of human transmission increase in healthcare settings in the absence of adequate control measures.  Symptoms of Lassa fever can take up to three weeks to show, although most cases exhibit mild symptoms and go undiagnosed. Exposure to Lassa virus can cause fever, fatigue, and headache. In severe cases, symptoms like haemorrhaging, facial swelling, low blood pressure, chest and back pain etc may also develop. Shocks, seizures, and coma have also been reported as symptoms of Lassa fever.  Deafness is a prominent symptom associated with Lassa fever. Around 25% of recovered patients exhibit deafness of varied levels, and hearing is partially restored in half the cases.  Clinical diagnosis of Lassa fever is challenging because of the similarity in symptoms with other diseases like Ebola, malaria, and typhoid fever. The most common method used to detect Lassa fever is enzyme-linked immunosorbent serologic assays (ELISA). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the most efficient test used to diagnose Covid-19, can also be used to detect infection by Lassa virus.  Antiviral drug ribavirin is often used to treat Lassa fever although the usage is not a licensed treatment. Other procedures used are supportive care including hydration, oxygenation, and treatment of specific complications arising due to the disease. Preventive vaccines are currently under research and development.  In India, the International Health Division under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare lists Lassa fever as a disease of international significance. The country has not reported any cases of the disease so far.  Lassa fever has exhibited a low case-fatality rate so far, killing 1% of the infected patients. The disease is particularly severe in late pregnancy and results in maternal death and/or loss of the foetus in over 80% of the cases. However, most reported cases of the disease are mild.  The best way to prevent contracting Lassa virus is to keep foods safe from rats in areas where the disease is prevalent. Setting up mouse traps, keeping homes free of rodents, and not consuming them as a food source can drastically reduce the possibility of coming in contact with the virus. ",Priyali Prakash,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/explained-what-is-lassa-fever-and-should-you-be-worried/article65071901.ece
311,"February 21, 2022",14:02 IST,sci-tech,health,Eco chambers on social media spread vaccine misinformation: Study," Misinformation on social media contributes to vaccine hesitancy and creates a false image of benefits and disadvantages concerning the jabs, according to a study. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has named vaccine hesitancy as one of the greatest threats to global health. ""Where vaccine supporters often refer to news media and science sites when sharing knowledge about vaccines on Twitter, we can see that profiles belonging to anti-vaccine profiles far more often share links to YouTube videos and to sites that are known to spread fake news and conspiracy theories,"" said Bjarke Monsted from Technical University of Denmark (DTU). “Vaccine opponents’ profiles often link to commercial sites that sell alternative health products. This is surprising given that vaccine hesitancy often stems from a fear of financial conflicts of interest,” Mr. Monsted said. Previous research, Mr. Monsted said, has shown that people who earn a fortune from the sale of alternative health products globally are responsible for vaccine misinformation. The new study, recently published in the journal PLoS ONE, analysed some 60 billion tweets written before the COVID-19 pandemic to understand where the discussion about vaccines takes place on Twitter to better understand today's vaccine hesitancy on social media. Using newly developed methods in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) called ‘deep learning and natural language processing’, Mr. Monsted and Professor Sune Lehmann from DTU taught a computer to identify which views on vaccines were expressed in a given tweet. They identified the users who consistently expressed strong views in favour of (provaxx) or against vaccines (antivaxx) and from which sources the profiles shared their vaccine information. The finding shows that 22.5% of antivaxx-profiles' vaccine tweets link to YouTube videos, the researchers said. They then grouped the sources into five categories: Sites known for sharing pseudoscience and conspiracy theories, news sites, social media, YouTube, and commercial sites relating to medicine and health. The study confirms the echo chamber effect, making it hard for vaccine advocates and opponents to encounter each other's views on the internet -- because social media algorithms ensure that people interact with others whose opinions align with their own. ""We discovered that the sources of information, which people are exposed to in their social networks, depend heavily on their own attitudes towards vaccines,"" said Mr. Monsted. ""The more resistance to vaccines a user expressed, the further from the norm was the media picture they were exposed to from their circle of friends,"" the researcher said. The researchers noted that when it comes to avoiding medical misinformation, the responsibility lies not just with the tech giants but also with media outlets. Mr. Lehmann hopes that the novel method can provide a greater understanding of the vaccine discussion during the pandemic and in the future. ""Our research covers the period before COVID-19. And there is no doubt that vaccines have become a talking point in a whole new way in the last two years,"" Mr. Lehmann added.

312,"February 20, 2022",19:00 IST,sci-tech,health,Leprosy detection fell during pandemic: report," The COVID-19 pandemic and its ensuing recommendations on social distancing and lockdowns caused a fall of 62.5% in the detection of active leprosy cases between April and September 2020 when compared with the previous year’s corresponding period in four States — Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh.  In 2019, these States accounted for 35% of the total new leprosy cases reported in the country. They reported 22,000 new cases during April-September 2019, but only 8,270 for the same period in 2020. The latest report by the Leprosy Mission Trust India, “The Pandemic and the People’s Plight’’, says that active case finding activities were suspended in most States since April 2020. Two other worrying trends emerged. The report highlights that the proportions of multibacillary (MB) leprosy and grade-2 disability (G2D) among the new cases increased by 20% and 12%, respectively, during April-September 2020, compared to the same six-month period in 2019. Moreover, the proportion of both women and children among new cases decreased by 70% compared to the same two quarters in 2019. These figures were shared by the National Leprosy Eradication Programme (NLEP), notes the report. Other Indian States may have experienced similar outcomes, especially when the second wave put brakes on the Leprosy Case Detection Campaign for the entire second quarter of 2021 (April-June). The report also has constraints in terms of the sample size it reached out to. “Collectively, we could reach out to around 400 respondents for getting firsthand information on the impact of COVID-19. The in-house survey of patients, residents of leprosy colonies, public health consultants, ASHA workers and students from vocational training centres is restricted to six States and Union Terrotories: Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu,’’ it said. The report said that people undergoing leprosy treatment need to visit hospitals regularly for their routine medical needs such as blood pressure monitoring, ulcer dressing, medicines (multi drug therapy or MDT blister packs, and steroids), and micro-cellular rubber (MCR) footwear. The report also states: “With public transport becoming out of bounds because of nationwide lockdown, the scope for getting healthcare and disability management services in institutional setup reduced. Of all the things that COVID-19 pandemic taught us, the most important was, perhaps, the fact that the ‘vulnerable population’ is not a homogenous entity. Their vulnerability is sometimes a complex intersection of different social variables: poverty, disability, stigma, exclusion, etc. Much to our dismay, the pandemic demonstrated how it affects different vulnerable groups differently, with adverse consequences being the constant factor.’’

313,"February 20, 2022",16:08 IST,sci-tech,health,Kerala looks to pursue a “PD-First” policy,"  As the Health department gives patients with end-stage renal diseases (ESRD) the option of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) at home free of cost, patients in the State are being offered fresh hope.  Subsidised CAPD at home is a scheme that had been piloted by the Health department in three districts in 2018, with limited success. The Government has now announced the upscaling of this project across 11 districts to offer CAPD totally free of cost to ESRD patients  Peritoneal dialysis (PD) continues to remain an under-utilised strategy for patients who have to be started on dialysis treatment following ESRD. While it offers the advantage of cost-saving, flexibility and independence to patients, there are also inherent disadvantages like infections, failure of technique or insufficient dialysis clearance over time. However, even when PD is definitely an option worth exploring, the Government will need to address the inherent challenges and the many social and clinical realities involving chronic renal disease patients if PD has to be a sustainable programme, experts caution. Moreover, lack of expertise and facilities in the State health system to handle dialysis patients and the total absence of a State CKD (chronic kidney diseases) registry to monitor and track the increasing population going into dialysis, dialysis quality and survival data are major lacunae if the State intends to adopt “PD First” (PD as the primary modality of renal replacement therapy, rather than haemodialysis, for a patient starting on maintenance dialysis) as an established health policy  Palakkad, Alappuzha, Ernakulam districts have had some success with patients on PD but the numbers are low. Unlike haemodialysis, which can only be done in hospitals under technical supervision, PD is more cost-effective and gives the patient the convenience of doing it within the comfort of their own homes, maintaining aseptic precautions. Peritoneal dialysis makes use of a natural membrane inside the abdominal cavity, the peritoneum, to filter accumulated toxins and other wastes in the blood, flowing through the capillaries lining the peritoneum. Dialysis fluid from a bag is poured into the abdomen through a catheter inserted into the abdomen. The fluid remains inside the abdomen for 4-6 hours, during which time the patient is free to move about. The solution, along with the wastes is drained out into a sterile bag after 4-6 hours and fresh solution again poured in . The patient is trained to do this “exchange” three or four times a day. The advantage is that he need not stay hooked to a machine  The outcome of both modalities of dialysis are not very different either. Yet, even globally, the dialysis scene is skewed heavily towards haemodialysis. In Kerala, while an estimated 35,000 patients are undergoing maintenance haemodialysis annually, those on PD are less than 500. Nephrologists report that most patients who start on PD switch to haemodialysis within a year as they are not able to sustain the pressure of continuous dialysis on their own. “A successful PD-first policy requires understanding inherent patient factors, selecting patients carefully, and improving technique-related factors by training physicians, nurses, patients, and caregivers better”, notes a paper on Hong kong’s success with PD First policy.  “For an ESRD patient who is being started on maintenance dialysis, PD is a better option because whatever residual renal function is there will be preserved and he can remain on PD for a few years (PD becomes ineffective after a few years , when the patient can be shifted to haemodialysis or the option of kidney transplant may be explored) .  But patients have to be chosen carefully. The patient has to have a clean room, a caregiver to support him at home and with some training, he can be put on the routine of doing the dialysis exchanges thrice a day, each session lasting about 20 minutes. It is not easy, but when you consider the huge savings for the health system as well as the patient, PD first is a policy worth pursuing,” says S. Gomathy, Professor and Head of Nephrology, TD Medical College, Alappuzha. The main challenge is in keeping the patient motivated enough so that he does it diligently and without defaulting, thrice every single day. Patients may drop out of PD because of the sheer tedium. Inadequacy of dialysis clearance and infections are problems which should be tackled by district hospitals promptly.  Given the rising incidence of chronic kidney disease in Kerala, a better acceptance of PD would help improve the access to dialysis, especially in rural areas. But the health system at the district-level will have to be primed to deal with all emergency medical requirements of PD patients, including provision of emergency haemodialysis. The collection and disposal of the large amount of biomedical waste generated on a daily basis — at least six sterile plastic bags a day — is another problem for which the system would have to have some permanent solution.  “If “PD First” is to be a policy for Kerala, setting up the CKD registry will have to be a priority. The State will need to monitor its population on dialysis for at least an year and produce essential data on the quality of dialysis, drop out rate of patients on PD, loss of patients while on PD and the survival advantage of PD over haemodialysis for it be a sustained programme,” a public health expert says.",C Maya,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-looks-to-pursue-a-pd-first-policy/article65068081.ece

Leprosy however, continues to exist in India. As per data, in 2020-21, the country saw 65, 147 new cases of leprosy, down from 1,14,451 cases in 2019-20 -- but whether this data is a reflection of ground reality is not known, as the Covid-19 pandemic hampered detection of cases, patients were unable to access healthcare services due to the lockdowns and almost all public health efforts were directed towards combating the pandemic. The disease, caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium leprae, primarily affects the skin and the nerves under the skin. It causes lesions, and if left untreated, leads to deformities and disabilities. Despite free treatment available across the country in the government health sector, leprosy continues to be stigmatised and patients discriminated against, often in their own homes and communities.  In 2005, India officially eliminated leprosy as a public health problem -- as less than 1 in 10,000 people contracted it in a year. But some States in the country continue to have higher rates -- parts of Bihar, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, West Bengal and a few others make up a sizeable chunk of all cases in the country.  So what happened to leprosy services in India after 2005? And what happened during the pandemic? Why does India still account for a significant proportion of the world’s leprosy cases?

This week at a Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, Colorado, United States. researchers described the case of a 60-year-old African American woman who was diagnosed with an HIV infection in 2013 was started on the standard HIV treatment regimen of anti-retroviral treatment (ART) therapy consisting of tenofovir, emtricitabine and raltegravir. She was also later diagnosed with leukemia in 2017 In that year she received cord blood, or embryonic stem cells, from a donor with a rare mutation that naturally blocks the HIV virus from infecting cells. She was also given blood stem cells, or adult stem cells, from a relative. The adult stem cells boosted the patient’s immunity and possibly helped the cord blood cells fully integrate with the lady’s immune system. A little over three years after the transplant, the lady discontinued the ART and today more than 14 months down, her doctors report that she has no sign of HIV in her blood and also has no detectable antibodies to the virus. Embryonic stem cells are potentially able to grow into any kind of cell and hence their appeal as therapy, though there is no explanation for why this mode of treatment appeared to be more effective. Only two people have reportedly been cured of HIV so far and both have relied on bone marrow transplants from donors who carried the mutation, called CCR5 delta 32, that naturally makes one immune to an HIV infection and AIDS.  Timothy Ray Brown, or the ‘Berlin patient’ staved off the virus for 12 years but died of cancer in 2020. Another patient, Adam Castillejo, was the second reported case of a cure. Both men received bone marrow transplants from donors who carried a mutation that blocks HIV infection. However, the previous transplants involved adult stem cells and these cells from the bone marrow replaced their immune system. The body’s natural tendency is to reject foreign stem cells and so both donors suffered side effects such as graft versus host disease where the donor’s cells attack the recipient’s body. Both men developed severe illnesses throughout their HIV remission but in contrast the woman was discharged from hospital within 17 days of the transplant and did not develop graft versus host disease. Her doctors theorise that it was a combination of the embryonic and adult stem cells that led to a better health outcome. However, because it’s only been five-odd years of being HIV-free, it remains to be seen if the lady will live longer than Brown or Castillejo. Not at all. While this approach is certainly a welcome addition to the arsenal of treatments, stem cell therapy is a cumbersome exercise and barely accessible to most HIV patients in the world. Moreover, this requires stem cells from that rare group of individuals with the beneficial mutation. Anti-retroviral therapy, through the years, has now ensured that HIV/AIDS isn’t always a death sentence and many with access to proper treatment have lifespans comparable to those without HIV.  A vaccine for HIV or a drug that eliminates the virus is still elusive and would be the long sought ‘cure’ for HIV/AIDS. As per the India HIV Estimation 2019 report, the estimated adult (15 to 49 years) HIV prevalence trend has been declining in India since the epidemic’s peak in the year 2000 and has been stabilising in recent years. In 2019, HIV prevalence among adult males (15–49 years) was estimated at 0.24% and among adult females at 0.20% of the population.  There were 23.48 lakh Indians living with HIV in 2019. Maharashtra had the maximum at 3.96 lakh followed by Andhra Pradesh (3.14 lakh) and Karnataka.  India’s National Aids Control Organisation says that ART is “freely available” to all those who require and there are deputed centres across the country where they can be availed from.",Jacob P Koshy,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/a-miracle-cure-for-hiv/article65059925.ece
316,"February 17, 2022",12:23 IST,sci-tech,health,"This isn’t yet another fancy hospital, future of medical knowledge will unfold in IISc.-Bengaluru: Subroto Bagchi"," 
Philanthropist couples Susmita and Subroto Bagchi, and Radha and N.S. Parthasarathy collectively donated ₹425 crore to the Indian Institute of Science (IISc.) to set up a postgraduate medical college and an 800-bed multi-speciality hospital on its Bengaluru campus. Less than a year ago, the Bagchis had committed ₹340 crore towards building a cancer hospital and palliative care centre in Odisha. Mr. Bagchi, co-founder of Mindtree, in a conversation with The Hindu spoke about why health is the most important space that requires attention and how the Covid-19 pandemic drastically changed his views about the term ‘lifetime’. Excerpts from an interview: 
For a nation of 1.3 billion people, we are woefully inadequate in terms of healthcare infrastructure and investment. The big part of this is not the hardware, it is the human capital mismatch. We do not have enough doctors, nurses, paramedics, hospital beds. As a result, access and equity have suffered hugely over the last many decades. The underbelly of the healthcare system was starkly visible during the Covid-19 pandemic, and we run the risk of collective amnesia as we come out of it.
 
The difficulty with us is that we think that the big strides in healthcare must be always the government’s job. But if we look at developed nations, great things in medical research and healthcare happened because private individuals came forward to write a cheque and had the sagacity to walk away from it. That is how Sloan Kettering (oldest and largest cancer centre in New York) happened. Harvard, Yale and Stanford and Oxford flourished because of commitment from non-government and non-institutional actors of change.
 
Long back, Susmita and I chose to focus on healthcare due to personal reasons. Her mother battled cancer and later dementia. My mother was blind, and my father had mental health issues. Through deeply personal experiences, deeply personal choices present themselves. That is how we decided to work on mental health, vision, cancer and ageing. We decided to set up a large cancer hospital and a palliative care centre in Odisha. This will be one of the largest cancer cure and care facilities in the country.
 
Sri Shankara Cancer Foundation from Bengaluru is setting up a 750-bed hospital in Bhubaneswar. Karunashraya, the hugely regarded palliative care pioneer, will set up their facility. These two will be adjacent to each other. The Odisha Government has given 20 acres of prime land to each of these institutions free of charge. With these two major projects under way, we needed to do something in Karnataka.
 
Odisha and Karnataka are very dear to us. Odisha has given us life, and Karnataka has given us identity. But, we were looking at a possible convergence between health and education. That is exactly what happened with the IISc. project. While our work in Odisha will deliver care, our support to IISc. will lead to path-breaking inter-disciplinary research that will have bench-to-bed translational impact. It will create a special cadre of scientist-doctors that India badly needs. The facility will create a new breed of physician-scientists who will pursue careers in clinical research to develop new treatments and healthcare solutions.
 
The Government of India had taken a decision that institutes of eminence. like IISc. and IITs, could start medical schools so that science, engineering and medicine could be under one roof, as it happens in leading institutions in the world. But, the caveat was that these institutes were told to generate their own resources.
 
Health facilities require massive investments. It could freeze anyone into inaction. But we were stumped when we saw how far, how professionally, a group of leaders in IISc. had gone forward to blueprint their ideas. Frankly, when I read their papers, I was asking myself, could I myself have written a plan so good with my decades of institution building experience. They drew us in.
 
As I said before, India has woefully inadequate healthcare research and delivery capacity. Bengaluru is better than other places, but not good enough. Not globally comparable. Not demographically adequate. But leaving that aside, don’t for a moment think that all that is happening is an 800-bed multi-speciality hospital in IISc. The hospital is the focal point where doctors, physicists, biologists, nano-technologist, software and deep tech experts as much as med-tech start-ups will learn by doing. The bigger umbrella is the Institute of Medical Sciences, which will do cross-disciplinary research, training, innovation, capacity building. The hospital will be the stage on which they will all perform. It is called a bench-to-bed and bed-to-bench flow of knowledge.
 
New machines and equipment will be designed and tried here, new processes will be perfected here, new vaccines will be designed, developed and tried here. A whole new cadre of scientist-doctors will come out of it who will be able to lift the larger eco-system of healthcare in India. This isn’t yet another fancy hospital. The future of medical knowledge will unfold here.
 
We have been told that the green cover of IISc. will not suffer. The total area is only 15 acres in about a 440-acre campus. If there is any need for relocation of any tree, there is enough technology and capability on hand to do so. The IISc. administration is deeply committed to protecting its environment. We were very impressed with how they have executed their super-state-of-the-art fablab without sacrificing a single tree.
 
It made Susmita and me, and at the same time Partha and Radha, rethink timelines. It gave us a sense of urgency like never before. We had a shared belief that we must spend our money for the larger good in our own lifetime. The Covid-19 pandemic told us, don’t think a lifetime can be a long time. Engage now, tomorrow may be too late.

317,"February 17, 2022",11:59 IST,sci-tech,health,Google Doodle honours the inventor of chickenpox vaccine on 94th birthday," 
A doodle on search giant Google’s homepage on February 17, 2022, has featured Japanese virologist Dr Michiaki Takahashi, the developer of the world’s first vaccine against chickenpox, to commemorate his 94th birthday.  
The doodle, illustrated by Tatsuro Kiuchi, a Tokyo-based artist, depicts Dr Takahashi looking through his microscope, and putting a bandaid on a child’s arm.  
“Thanks to his innovations, millions of cases of chickenpox are prevented each year,” Google said in a note released with the doodle.  Dr Takahashi was born on this day in 1928 in Japan’s Osaka. His chickenpox vaccine, named ‘Oka’, was developed in 1974 and subsequently approved by the World Health Organization. The lifesaving immunisation went on to be used by 80 countries and was administered to millions of children . 
After earning a medical degree from the Osaka university, Dr Takahashi had joined the Research Institute for Microbial Disease at the same university in 1959, to study polio viruses and measles.  
In 1963, Dr Takahashi accepted a research fellowship at Baylor College in the United States. It was during his time at the institute that his son developed a severe case of chickenpox, which led him to change the focus of his research, with the aim of developing a vaccine against the viral illness. 
Returning to Japan in 1965, the virologist began culturing weakened, live strains of chickenpox. In 1974, he came up with the first vaccine against Varicella Virus, which causes the disease. The drug was subjected to a thorough trial process, involving immunosuppressed patients, eventually proving to be highly effective.  
The Research Foundation for Microbial Disease at Osaka University began rolling out the vaccine in 1986 in Japan. At the time, Dr Takahashi’s was the only vaccine approved by the World Health Organisation, against Varicella virus.  
In 1994, Dr Takahashi was appointed the director of the Microbial Disease study Group at Osaka University. He held this position until retirement.  
Dr Michiaki Takahashi died in 2013 of a cardiac arrest. ",Diksha Munjal,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/google-doodle-honours-dr-michiaki-takahashi/article65058366.ece

The document was released Tuesday night.  It has estimated that 5% of adults worldwide suffer from depression each year, and yet it remains a neglected global health crisis. Poor understanding of this condition and lack of psychosocial and financial resources are already impacting on prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and the economic prosperity of nations.  There is abundant evidence that much can be done to prevent depression and aid recovery even in resource-limited settings, and yet the burden of people living with depression, many of them not diagnosed and consequently not treated. While in high income countries, about half of people suffering from depression come under this category, this rises to 80-90% in low- and middle-income countries. As expected, the COVID-19 pandemic has created additional challenges, with the hardship, bereavement, isolation, and uncertainties, besides limited access to health care exacerbating mental health conditions, and bringing more people to the brink.  The document was authored by 25 experts from 11 countries spanning disciplines from neuroscience to global health and advised by people with experience of depression.
Commission Chair Professor Helen Herrman said: “Depression is a global health crisis that demands responses at multiple levels. This Commission offers an important opportunity for united action to transform approaches to mental health care and prevention globally. Investing in reducing the burden of depression will give millions of people the chance to become healthier, happier and more productive members of society, help to strengthen national economies, and advance the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals for 2030. The Lancet- WPA Commission ‘Time for united action on depression’ has called for a whole-society approach to preventing depression, on the lines of what has been done for conditions such as heart disease or cancer.  Co-author Charles Reynolds adds: “We know that most individuals with depression at all stages of life will recover if they obtain adequate support and treatment. With sound science, political will, and shared responsibility, depression can be prevented and treated and potentially disabling consequences avoided. We must empower people with experience of depression together with families, practitioners, policymakers and civil society to address the tsunami of unmet needs.”",Ramya Kannan,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/depression-remains-a-neglected-global-health-crisis-report/article65056889.ece
319,"February 16, 2022",22:40 IST,sci-tech,health,UPDATE 1-First woman reported cured of HIV after stem cell transplant,"  A U.S. patient with leukemia has become the first woman and the third person to date to be cured
of HIV after receiving a stem cell transplant from a donor who was naturally resistant to the virus that causes AIDS,
researchers reported on February 15. The case of a middle-aged woman of mixed race, presented at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunisitic Infections in Denver, is also the first involving umbilical cord blood, a newer approach that may make the treatment available to more people. Since receiving the cord blood to treat her acute myeloid leukemia — a cancer that starts in blood-forming cells in the bone marrow — the woman has been in remission and free of the virus for 14 months, without the need for potent HIV treatments known as antiretroviral therapy. The two prior cases occurred in males — one white and one Latino — who had received adult stem cells, which are more
frequently used in bone marrow transplants. ""This is now the third report of a cure in this setting, and the first in a woman living with HIV,"" Sharon Lewin, president-elect of the International AIDS Society, said in a statement. The case is part of a larger U.S.-backed study led by Dr. Yvonne Bryson of the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), and Dr. Deborah Persaud of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. It aims to follow 25 people with HIV who undergo a transplant with stem cells taken from umbilical cord blood for the treatment of cancer and other serious conditions. Patients in the trial first undergo chemotherapy to kill off the cancerous immune cells. Doctors then transplant stem cells
from individuals with a specific genetic mutation in which they lack receptors used by the virus to infect cells. Scientists believe these individuals then develop an immune system resistant to HIV. Prof. Lewin said bone marrow transplants are not a viable strategy to cure most people living with HIV. But the report ""confirms that a cure for HIV is possible and further strengthens using gene therapy as a viable strategy for an HIV cure"", she said. The study suggests that an important element to the success is the transplantation of HIV-resistant cells. Previously,
scientists believed that a common stem cell transplant side effect called graft-versus-host disease, in which the donor
immune system attacks the recipient’s immune system, played a role in a possible cure. ""Taken together, these three cases of a cure post stem cell transplant all help in teasing out the various components of the
transplant that were absolutely key to a cure,"" Prof. Lewin said.",Reuters,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/first-woman-reported-cured-of-hiv-after-stem-cell-transplant/article65057101.ece

A ₹35-crore worth equipment for robotic surgery was installed and a fully modular operation theatre has been readied at a cost of ₹50 lakh, Health Minister Ma. Subramanian said. Shortly after inspecting the centre on Wednesday, he said the Chief Minister would inaugurate the centre after the model code of conduct ceases to be in force.  “Such facilities have been set up at 74 centres across the country. In Tamil Nadu, six private hospitals have similar facilities. Except for Central government institutions such as Jipmer, no State government hospital has such a centre,” he said. Six doctors of the hospital were sent for training in robotic surgery, the Minister said. Patients would be covered under the Chief Minister’s Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme, he added. Noting that the State government was taking several steps for early detection of cancer and its treatment, he said the government, along with Cancer Institute, was involved in the cancer registry project. “In six to seven years, continuous check-up for detection of patients with stage I and II cancers would be done across the State. Through this, at least 66% of people would be covered by 2030 with a full medical check-up. The State government is expediting the work for early detection of cancer,” he said. He said that such advanced centres would help in the treatment of cancers. Dedicated cancer treatment centres are coming up at Karapettai in Kancheepuram as well as in Madurai, Kanniyakumari and Salem districts. “We are taking several steps to reduce the deaths due to cancer,” the Minister said.  A total of 49,79,565 persons were so far covered under “Makkalai Thedi Maruthuvam”, a scheme that was launched on August 5, 2021. Every day, nearly 15,000 to 20,000 persons benefited under the scheme.  He said that this Sunday, the Chief Minister would hand over medicines at the house of the person, who would be the 50,00,000th beneficiary in Sithalapakkam panchayat. Another 188 new ambulances with advanced life-saving equipment would be rolled out. This would take the total number of ambulances in the State to 1,491.  So far, 18,580 persons injured in road accidents were treated under the State government’s Innuyir Kappom-Nammai Kakkum. So far, the government had spent nearly ₹16.97 crore towards their treatment, he said.  From 609 hospitals, the total number of hospitals empanelled under the scheme had increased to 640 — 218 government hospitals and 422 private hospitals.  Health Secretary J.

The U.N. health agency said late Tuesday in its weekly report on the pandemic that just over 16 million new COVID-19 infections and about 75,000 deaths were reported worldwide last week. The Western Pacific was the only region to report a rise in new weekly cases, an increase of about 19%, Southeast Asia reported a decrease of about 37%, the biggest drop globally. The number of deaths rose by 38% in the Middle East and by about one-third in the Western Pacific.  The biggest number of new COVID-19 cases was seen in Russia. Cases there and elsewhere in Eastern Europe doubled in recent weeks, driven by a surge of the hugely infectious omicron variant. WHO said that all other coronavirus variants, including alpha, beta and delta, continue to decline globally as omicron crowds them out. Among the more than 400,000 COVID-19 virus sequences uploaded to the world's biggest virus database in the last week, more than 98% were omicron. WHO said the BA.2 version of omicron appears to be “steadily increasing” and its prevalence has risen in South Africa, Denmark, the U.K. and other countries. Health officials have noted, however, that omicron causes milder disease than previous COVID-19 variants and in countries with high vaccination rates, hospitalization and death rates have not increased substantially, even with omicron's spread. WHO's Africa director, Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, said last week there was “light at the end of the tunnel” for the continent and that even despite low vaccination rates, Africa was transitioning from the acute pandemic phase of COVID-19.  That optimism contrasts sharply with warnings from WHO Director-Feneral Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who has said repeatedly the pandemic is not over and is premature for countries to think that the end might be imminent.

323,"February 16, 2022",15:04 IST,sci-tech,health,‘Pandemic fuels dry eye condition’,"  Unusual lifestyle and prolonged working hours in the Work From Home (WFH) format necessitated by the pandemic has given rise to chronic dry eyes among a large number of people in the country, ophthalmologists said. 
Chronic dry eye is a “potentially serious” condition that can result in eye discomfort and vision issues, they said.
“Dry eye problem has become rampant during the Covid-19 pandemic due to changes in lifestyle. Increase in screen time, disruption in nutritious eating habits, and irregular sleep patterns are causing a rise in dry eye cases,” said Dr. Nitin Deshpande, Director, Shree Ramkrishna Netralaya.
He said staying indoors or at home has contributed to the rise in cases of dry eyes as well as aggravating the symptoms. 
“Indoor air quality causes dry eyes. Air conditioning increases airflow over the eyes. This combined with work in front of screens,- causes increased evaporation of tears leading to dryness of eyes,” he said.
According to eye specialists, improper diet due to changes in cooking and dining routine has led to the lack of essential fatty acids, Vitamin A, Vitamin D in the body which are important to maintaining eye health.
Besides, improper sleep is contributing to dry eyes by reducing eye fluid quantity. 
“With the increased use of electronic devices, the screen time has gone up tremendously. Increased screen time is the major factor for dry eyes. The normal blink rate is 15 blinks per minute. Screen time has reduced the blink rate to 5 to 7 blinks per minute,” he said.
“Fewer blinks and incomplete blinks reduce moisture on the surface of the eyes. Blue light from the screen as per evidence does not damage eyes but it can affect sleep patterns. Improper sleep may cause dryness of the eyes, he added.
Also, the improper fitting of the Covid-19 protocol mask contributes to the dryness of the eyes.
“Breathing with a mask causes air to flow upwards and results in evaporation of tears. Taping the mask over the nose can prevent upward airflow and help in addressing dry eyes problem,” Dr Deshpande added. 
Ophthalmologists have recommended people to follow the 20:20:20 pattern. 
People are advised to take breaks from the screen every 20 minute and look at an object 20 feet away for 20 seconds.
One needs to blink frequently, wear a mask fitting properly to prevent upward flow of air. 
The smartphone or laptop screen should be off 2-3 hours before bedtime.
“Use lubricating eye drops and see a doctor if there is any trouble,” said Dr Prerana Shah, Consulting Opthalmologist & Vitreoretinal Surgeon.
“Regular eye tests can prevent problems at a stage where they can be treated with the best results. Therefore, the timely detection is a vital part of eye care,” she said.",Special Correspondent,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/pandemic-fuelling-dry-eye-condition-how-to-avoid-it/article65001580.ece
324,"February 15, 2022",23:18 IST,sci-tech,health,How ventilation and air filtration can help fight COVID-19," COVID-19 is an airborne disease, and the latest Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 is the most transmissible thus far. While vaccination is effective in reducing the risk of hospitalisation and death, awareness of risky situations and taking precautions like wearing masks and ensuring ventilation or air purification can reduce your risk of catching the virus. In our previous article published in The Hindu on January 10, we discussed the best masks and mask-wearing practices. Here, we expand on ventilation and air filtration. Over the past two years, we have learned that the virus is more likely to spread in situations where virus-carrying particles exhaled by an infected person can accumulate in the air (like cigarette smoke) and other people breathe in these particles. Outdoor, airy conditions where you are not close to anyone are generally safe. On the other hand, if you are in a crowded outdoor space with no wind for a prolonged period of time, you will be at relatively higher risk. An indoor space that is not well ventilated and in which an infected person is present is perhaps the riskiest situation for most people. Think, for instance, of a COVID-19-positive patient being isolated in a room and not wearing a mask. The first step to reduce your risk of catching COVID-19 is to wear a well-fitting, high-filtration mask. The second step is to reduce the time you spend in such risky situations. The next steps are ventilation and/or air purification. Ventilation is the act of replacing stale room air with fresh outdoor air. As more people gather or live in an apartment or office, our activities warm up the space and our exhaled carbon dioxide (CO 2) can build up, leading to undesirable effects like drowsiness and impaired cognitive function. Fresh outside air can have significantly lower CO 2 and could be cooler than indoor room air, and so letting in fresh air lowers indoor CO 2 levels and cools the indoor space. If someone in an indoor space is contagious, they emit virus-carrying particles when they breathe or talk or shout or sing. Uninfected people in the same space can then breathe in these viral particles and get infected. So, the simplest solution - natural ventilation - is to open a window (or keep a shop door open) to the outdoors, exchanging the virus-laden indoor air for fresh outdoor air. Natural ventilation may not always be enough, as it can depend on wind conditions, the positioning and size of the window, and other factors. Ventilation can be increased using box or pedestal fans that bring outside air in from one window or doorway, with indoor air being naturally pushed out of another open window. However, in hotter weather, we may not want hot outdoor air entering cooled indoor residences and workplaces. Further, with increasing air pollution in most Indian cities, unfiltered ventilation brings in construction dust and traffic pollution, which are also bad for our health. In such situations, air purifiers can help. Air purifiers can remove airborne particles (whether dust or smoke or exhaled virus-carrying particles or other bacteria) and thus limit indoor transmission of COVID-19. Other respiratory illnesses like the flu, colds, and diseases like tuberculosis are also transmitted by respiratory particles and droplets. Further, air pollution from outdoor (construction, traffic) and indoor (natural gas cooking, incense/camphor burning) sources can cause respiratory illnesses including asthma attacks. Thus, air purifiers in indoor spaces can be beneficial to our health at all times. Many such air purifiers are available in India, whether in stores or with reputable online retailers, and priced from ₹4,000 to over ₹50,000. So, how do we choose? We recommend air purifiers with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. Some units come with activated carbon filters that reduce odours (for example, volatile organic compounds or VOCs), which may also be helpful. However, electronic air purifiers using ionizers and similar non-HEPA technology are not recommended. These electronic/ionizer units often perform well below advertised specifications in your apartment. Further, electronic/ionizer units can produce harmful byproducts including indoor ozone, ultrafine particles, and additional VOCs. Just stick to “simple” HEPA filters. So, now we have a choice of HEPA (with or without activated carbon) air purifiers. How do we decide? Look at the Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR), usually reported in m 3/h. Higher is generally better, as the rated CADR is only achieved at the maximum fan speed which can be noisy; we may want to run the unit quietly (i.e. at lower fan speed) in some situations while ensuring satisfactory air filtration. To size the air purifier for an indoor space, calculate the ‘air changes per hour’ (ACH) as ‘ACH = CADR / room volume’ where the room volume is simply length x width x height (all in meters if CADR is in m 3/h). If there is a hall and/or a balcony that opens to the room with large open air paths (for example, always open doors or no doors), these should be included in the ‘room volume’ as well. An ACH above five is good; the higher, the better. We should also note that it is not necessary to purchase a commercial air purifier. The last two years have seen do-it-yourself solutions like the Corsi-Rosenthal box, which has a box fan on one side and air filters on four other sides. The organisation Prana Pan-India, in partnership with Active Buildings, makes 'Bubble' air cleaners based on the Corsi-Rosenthal box, priced at the low end of commercial air purifiers. While one can never guarantee zero-risk conditions, we can significantly reduce the risk of indoor transmission of COVID-19 (and other respiratory diseases) using ventilation, air purifiers, and high-quality masks in addition to vaccination.

325,"February 14, 2022",23:24 IST,sci-tech,health,antimicrobial resistance," Antimicrobial Resistance Collaborators, “Global burden of bacterial antimicrobial resistance in 2019: a systematic analysis”, The Lancet, January 19, 2022 , https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02724-0. 
After two years of relentless conversations about one pathogen that has ruled over the world causing over 52 lakh deaths in this period, The Lancet recently woke the world up to six other deadly pathogens (individually, or in combination with certain drugs) wrecking havoc in 2019, as a result of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). A late January 2022 publication in the peer-reviewed journal estimated that 4.95 million deaths were associated with bacterial anti microbial resistance in 2019. Bacterial antimicrobial resistance occurs when changes in bacteria causes the drugs used to treat the infection to become less effective. Arguably the first such comprehensive study on AMR globally, the paper authored by Antimicrobial Resistance Collaborators states that AMR is a leading cause of death around the world, with the highest number of deaths occurring in low-resource settings. “Understanding the burden of AMR and the leading pathogen-drug combinations contributing to it is crucial to making informed and location specific policy decisions, particularly about infection prevention and control programmes, access to essential antibiotics, and research and development of new vaccines and antibiotics,” the authors have recommended. The study is an analysis of the burden of AMR, producing estimates for 204 countries and territories, 23 bacterial pathogens, and 88 drug-pathogen combinations in 2019. They obtained data from multiple data sources — including from published studies (microbiology data, in patient data, data on multiple causes of death, and pharmaceutical sales data), and directly from the collaborators on the Global Research on Antimicrobial Resistance project, members of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries and Risk Factors collaborator network. Additionally, they computed two counter factual scenarios — one where all drug resistant infections are replaced by susceptible infections, and secondly, a scenario where all drug resistant infections are replaced with no infections. The deaths and burden of AMR were estimated in these two scenarios, and served as a measure to inform the development of potential intervention strategies. The six leading pathogens for deaths associated with resistance included E. coli, S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, S. pneumoniae, A. baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. They accounted for 73.4 % of the deaths attributable to AMR, and have been identified as priority pathogens by WHO. While the study was done in 2019, it is possible that the intervening epidemic has worsened the situation in terms of pushing AMR levels further. Dr. V. Ramasubramanian, Senior consultant, Dept of Infectious Diseases, Apollo Hospitals, Chennai, explains that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of antibiotics went up. The tendency was also to use antibiotics for patients on a ventilator with fever. Secondly, due to the large number of patients during the peaking waves, lack of appropriate infection control (as will be done in the case of patients with resistant bacteria) was rendered impossible. He points out that antibiotics are the only batch of drugs, used in one person, that can impact the rest of the community. When the gut biome is modified and excreted, it can lead to contamination of lands and water sources, thus spreading resistant bacteria further in the community. “We have always known that the burden of AMR in the world was huge. If action was not taken it was not because of the lack of data,” says Abdul Ghafur, infectious diseases expert, Apollo Hospitals, and architect of the Chennai Declaration. “It is because at the global level, we lost momentum.” India had framed its AMR policy in 2017, but only three States have initiated a state plan of action. According to official sources, 11 States are still working on a state plan of action. “We should apply the principles of COVID control to AMR control. By whom was the most effective strategies against COVID deployed? By the public. If you look at global strategy, the public have been consistently kept out of the picture. We should involve the public, carpet bomb them with information and announce an AMR action plan that will involve them in control. Another major strategy would be to ensure hygiene and sanitation in all places. In a study that we conducted among healthy volunteers, 14 % of them were carrying colistin-resistant bacteria in the gut, that had a food source, they did not contract it in a hospital, Dr. Ghafur said. AMR, reasons Dr. Ramasubramanian, is a classic case of ‘tragedy of the commons’ where a perfect solution is elusive. “You have got to use antibiotics, they are life saving. But there are so many factors that impact on such use such as using the right drugs, following the right quantity/schedule, over the counter issue of antibiotics, exposure to antibiotics used in certain sectors in farming and poultry as well as the lack of clear guidelines to follow (by the medical community) and incentives by the pharma industry to write out prescriptions for antibiotics …”. The authors of the paper also make a strong case for improving sanitation across the world, as part of an intervention strategy to prevent infections. Along with implementing hospital based prevention programmes, community based programmes that will improve hygiene, water and sanitation is essential. This is particularly important in low and middle income countries where the burden of AMR is highest and a clean water and sanitation network difficult to come by. They have also suggested that preventing infections through vaccinations will automatically reduce the need for antibiotics. Currently, vaccines are available only for one of the six leading pathogens (S pneumoniae) but vaccine programmes are reportedly on for some others as well. Reducing exposure to antibiotics that are used in the farming sector and poultry industry is also key. In this context, Dr. Ghafur points out that India’s move to ban colistin usage in the poultry industry will go a long way in reducing the AMR burden in the country.  Antibiotic stewardship, or minimising the use of antibiotics unless absolutely necessary, remains at the core of the fight against AMR. It is in this aspect that Dr. Ghafur indicates the strong involvement of the community. It is the hope of all collaborators, who continue to fight the big war with bacterial antimicrobial resistance, before, and through pandemics, that this new data provides the urgency and fresh momentum for global action to counter the single biggest burden that poses a major threat to human health.",Ramya Kannan,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/the-fight-against-antimicrobial-resistance/article65049365.ece

The project will be in line with global examples of integrating science, engineering and medicine under a single institution, creating “physician-scientists.” IISc. inked a partnership with philanthropists Susmita and Subroto Bagchi, and Radha and N.S. Parthasarathy, who collectively donated the amount. Addressing mediapersons in Bengaluru on Monday, IISc. Director Govindan Rangarajan said the new venture would be named IISc. Medical School and Bagchi-Parthasarathy Hospital. “The academic centrepiece of this initiative will be an integrated dual degree MD-PhD programme aimed at creating a new breed of physician-scientists, who will pursue a career in clinical research to develop new treatments and healthcare solutions, driven by a bench-to-bedside philosophy. They will be trained simultaneously in the hospital as well as in the science and engineering laboratories at IISc.,” he said. The building of the 800-bed multispeciality hospital, catering to clinical training and research activities of the academic programme, has been designed by Ahmedabad-based company Archi Medes (I) Consultants Pvt. Ltd. Work on the project will start in June 2022, and the hospital will be operational by the end of 2024. According to National Medical Commission norms, students admitted in specific MD/MS and DM/MCh programmes will also be trained in appropriate sections of the hospital along with their classroom and laboratory training. The hospital will also implement advanced digital technologies and solutions, such as integrated Electronic Medical Record systems and a comprehensive telemedicine suite with haptics interfaces, the director explained. Asked if the hospital will be accessible to the public, Prof. Rangarajan said it will be open for all but will not be a charitable facility. “It will have a mixture of beds — private as well as insurance beds where patients can avail themselves of benefits under the government insurance schemes,” he said. The PG medical school will have an intake of 70 students and will start admission from 2025, he added. Speaking on behalf of the Bagchis, Ms. Susmita said, “In a country like ours, medical research and delivery cannot be left to the Government or the corporate sector alone. With IISc., we find a shared vision. It is an institution with depth, competence, leadership, and capacity to deliver in scale.” Ms. Radha said IISc.’s larger vision to integrate science, engineering, and medicine in one campus is a new concept in India. “IISc.’s global reputation and network will attract outstanding talent to create breakthroughs in research and delivery of medicine that must impact the masses,” she said.",Special Correspondent,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/iisc-bengaluru-receives-its-single-largest-private-donation-of-425-crore/article65048332.ece

The move to bring together the manufacturing and development synergies of NIL with the sales and distribution strengths of Dr. Reddy’s will result in around 400 Novartis employees losing their jobs.  “This strategic business decision is leading to the separation of approximately 400 employees of Novartis India Ltd due to role redundancies. We understand the implications of this difficult decision on those impacted and their loved ones and we are extending a severance package along with outplacement services,” Novartis said in a release.  The sales and distribution agreement, with Dr. Reddy’s, aims to further broaden access of these medicines beyond the current geographies to benefit many more patients, more efficiently, by significantly extending the reach of healthcare professionals through an expanded field force, it said. Separately, Dr. Reddy’s said it will be using its strengths in promotion and distribution to considerably expand the engagement with healthcare professionals with the aim of enabling access to patients in need. “This arrangement will strengthen our portfolio in the pain management and women’s health areas. It is our endeavour to build on the legacy created by NIL over the years and we intend to evaluate capabilities to maintain business continuity,” CEO-Branded Markets (India and Emerging Markets) of Dr.Reddy’s M.V.

328,"February 12, 2022",20:26 IST,sci-tech,health,"IV therapy, the new chapter of India’s wellness journey"," At first, IV therapy sounds like a gimmick or a wellness celebrity craze pushed by the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow and Khloé Kardashian. Social media gave a glancing view of the intravenous wellness trip that reportedly had users glowing from within, feeling like they can compete in the Olympics, or helping them recover from a hangover. So when Happy Head Clinic, Hyderabad was launched in February 2021 by founder Dr Venkaiah Mulakalapalli (with the Bengaluru setup having opened in November 2021), I was curious to understand IV therapy through a first-hand experience. While the clinic does both on-site and at-home procedures, I opted to visit the space. The clinic is also open to collaborating for curated gatherings or events; for example, in 2021, Happy Head went to Goa, at the request of a family hosting a wedding, with the ‘Nutri Glow’, ‘Hangover’, ‘Myers’ Cocktail’ and ‘Cleanser’ IV bags for the guests.   As I stepped in, I was met with a minimalist and spa-like space spread across three floors; there is a consulting space, a curtained-off section for one-shot vitamin injections, a few rooms with recliners for solo or group sessions, an
al fresco space for those wanting to bask in the sun while they get their drip done, a pathology lab for blood work, and even an oxygen bar.

Hit or miss: Do these products overstate their health claims? As I fill out a consent form for the clinic (detailing my allergies and other aspects of medical history), I am handed a brochure that lists 13 IV therapies. Each aims to deliver unique combinations of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids directly into the bloodstream for health, wellness, and healing. For example, the ‘Hangover’ therapy includes vitamin B6, Thiamine, Magnesium and Glutathione, while ‘Nutri Glow’ offers Glutathione, vitamin C and Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA). The clinic can also mix the therapies, if advised by a doctor.  Going through all the permutation-combinations of vitamins and minerals can feel like brain overload: Happy Head encouraged me to consult with their in-house doctor about which one therapy would work best for me. Dr Mounica Vadlamudi recommended the Myers’ Cocktail – a concoction of B vitamins, vitamin C, Zinc and Magnesium – given that I had been feeling low on energy while fighting through waves of migraines for the past few weeks. Though IV therapy is recommended for migranes and chronic fatigue, Dr Vadlamudi says they offer a wide spectrum of treatments for people who are well, but want an easy boost. Most IV drips contain magnesium, vitamin C, calcium and some B vitamins, which are all beneficial. So, she says, people who want to boost their athletic performance, for instance, can also benefit from IV therapy.”  Also Read |
Breaking down the buzz around ‘wellness festivals’ A quick Internet search of IV therapy in India does bring up other names such as pan-Indian Dr Jamuna Pai’s Skin Lab — which mainly offers Glutathione and Vitamin C combos for aesthetic functions — or Reviv — a US-based brand that has clinics in Las Vegas, Mumbai, Nairobi, Dubai, New York and Sydney — among other cities. However, Happy Head is Hyderabad’s first homegrown IV wellness clinic. Dr Vadlamudi says, “After the consultation, we personalise each drip depending on the symptoms, concerns and health requirements of the client.”  Dr Vadlamudi also breaks down the benefits of IV therapy, “While we may do our best by popping supplements to increase immunity, we may absorb only 30 to 40% of oral supplements. With this process, she claims, your body absorbs a higher percentage of these nutrients.” 
Happy Head India is the country's first IV wellness clinic, with setups in Hyderabad and Bengaluru. The clinic offers IV drip sessions with various infusions of vitamins and minerals for the improvement of overall health. I am escorted to a private room where a nurse records my blood pressure and weight. She has me extending my arm where the IV drip will go. She numbs and gently disinfects the area around the medial cubital vein and in no time – with barely a prick – the needle is inserted. She shows me the 500ml bag of the Myers’ Cocktail and hooks it up to the IV stand. “This whole procedure will take about 45 minutes,” she explains, “and if you feel any nausea or headaches, which is rare, please let us know immediately. We will also be in shortly to adjust the flow of the drip.” Sometimes, she says, people are advised to take 1000ml if their hydration levels are extremely low.  Also Read |
What is ‘drinkable retinol’, and should you try it? She then leaves the room, but not before handing me a remote to the wall-mounted television. But I forego the streaming and instead opt to relax with my eyes closed. Forty-five minutes and a flow adjustment later, the nurse gently removes the IV needle and places a bandaid on my inner arm. I do not feel dizzy nor do I feel any migraine coming on. I walk around the space. By the time I head home, my skin looks less dull. Could it be the hydration and vitamin boost? For the next few nights, I also find myself sleeping better, as promised by the magnesium boost. Some Google and deep dives into Reddit (which included people suggesting you “just go eat your fruits and vegetables instead”) reveal there are people who have experienced similar results with IV therapy. (That said, the therapy is not designed to replace a healthy lifestyle and balanced diet. You can just eat your fruits and vegetables instead, for optimum health.) Nevertheless, IV drips are becoming increasingly popular as luxury wellness merges with medical treatments in an endless quest for effective beauty hacks. Actor Rana Daggubati, who has been open about his own health struggles, had long been vocal about bringing new-age legitimate wellness solutions to India. Perhaps, that explains why the actor is on board as a brand ambassador and early investor.  The IV therapies at Happy Head Clinic institutes in Hyderabad and Bengaluru are priced between ₹6,000 and ₹13,000, depending on which is suggested for your overall health’s needs and goals. V isit

329,"February 09, 2022",20:37 IST,sci-tech,health,India’s first mRNA COVID-19 vaccine likely to be rolled out by April,"  Data from human trials of India’s first homegrown mRNA COVID-19 vaccine are likely to be presented to authorities for evaluation by the end of the month, and company officials are aiming to roll out the product before April, two senior scientists connected to the Department of Biotechnology told
The Hindu .
  The mRNA vaccine being developed by Pune-based
Gennova Biopharmaceuticals is currently in phase 2/3 trials to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the candidate vaccine in healthy subjects. Around 4,000 volunteers have been recruited for the trial.
 India has so far approved at least six vaccines that can be manufactured locally but only two — Covishield and Covaxin —have been administered to over 99% Indians. Globally, mRNA vaccines have been at the vanguard of inoculation programmes in the United States and Europe because they exploit recent advances in molecular biotechnology and are said to be quicker to manufacture than older, well-established vaccine design principles. A limitation of the mRNA vaccines, or those made by Pfizer and Moderna, was that they were required to be stored in sub-zero conditions — a tough proposition in a country where such a degree of refrigeration is limited in availability. However, the prospective Gennova vaccine can be stored in ordinary refrigerators, the makers of Gennova have claimed earlier. The mRNA vaccine, can also purportedly be tweaked to be effective against newer variants, but so far, all the vaccines developed — including the prospective Gennova vaccine — have been customised to the original SARS-CoV-2. Gennova has been funded with ₹125 crore from the Department of Biotechnology (DBT). One official said that the company had faced challenges in recruiting volunteers because, to evaluate the vaccine’s efficacy, it would be necessary to find volunteers who had neither been vaccinated nor exposed to the virus. Several serology surveys have shown 70%-90% of adults and children have been exposed to the virus, and hence express antibodies on being tested since March 2020. “From what I know, the company is ready to roll-out the vaccine by March or April and will be approaching the Drug Controller General of India soon,” said Govindraj Padmanabhan, who chairs a vaccine committee of the DBT and has closely followed developments in the vaccine space. Sanjay Singh, CEO, Gennova Biopharmaceuticals, did not respond to text messages for comment. As of Wednesday, India has administered over 171 crore doses of COVID-19 vaccines. Health Ministry figures suggest that while 77% of the eligible adult population in India are fully vaccinated, 95% have received at least one COVID-19 jab. Over 65% of adolescents in the 15-18 years category have also received their first dose. In those vaccinated, close to 86% have received Covishield while nearly 14% have availed Covaxin.",Jacob Koshy,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/indias-first-mrna-covid-19-vaccine-likely-to-be-rolled-out-by-april/article38403287.ece

The suggestion comes after the Union Health Ministry in its response in the Lok Sabha recently said that as of January 30, 2022, a total of 70,102 cases (Covishield - 63,315 , Covaxin - 6,757 and Sputnik - 30) of AEFI and 1,013 cases of death (Covishield - 921, Covaxin - 92, and Sputnik ‘Nil’) were reported.  Vaccination is the safest way to prevent severe COVID-19 infection, said Dr. Chandrasekhar Singha, Paediatric Critical Care. He added that adverse events following vaccination could be a mild reaction like mild fever, body ache, headache. Reports of adverse events following vaccination, including deaths, do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused a health problem. “Vaccinated patients may die because of associated health related problems (associated lung problem, heart problem which was undiagnosed),” he added.  Responding to a question on AEFI, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare Bharati Pawar said that the Centre was providing operational guidelines for COVID-19 vaccination, guidance on classification, prevention, reporting and management aspect of AEFI. She added that frequent communication to the States and the Union Territories in the form of letters, advisories have been issued to improve reporting of minor, severe and serious AEFI. There is no recommendation to make reporting of AEFIs mandatory for healthcare service providers, the Centre told Parliament. The Minister added that cases of AEFI were monitored through a well-structured and robust surveillance system in India.  Dr. H.K Mahajan, HOD Anaesthesia, Indian Spinal Injuries Centre added this is a very generic data issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and there is nothing to be worried about. “Benefits of the COVID vaccine outweigh the harm and risk. In India it is the passive surveillance to monitor the adverse events following immunisation. It need not be mandatory to report these adverse events. The national adverse events committee issues guidelines and occurrence of the adverse events and that is not enough. Each death should have a medical audit and root cause analysis and curative and preventive action to minimise the adverse events,’’ he said.",Special Correspondent,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/benefits-of-covid-vaccine-outweigh-risks-say-experts/article38394472.ece
331,"February 05, 2022",20:46 IST,sci-tech,health,"IGIB develops future-proof primers, kits for RT-PCR test"," Using its expertise in genome sequencing and analysis pipeline of genome sequence data, the Delhi-based CSIR lab Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) has successfully developed a unique pool of primers and kits to be used in RT-PCR testing of SARS-CoV-2 virus. The most distinguishing aspect of the work carried by a team led by Dr. Sridhar Sivasubbu and Dr. Vinod Scaria at IGIB that was developing primers that will not be affected by mutations seen in SARS-CoV-2 variants. This may allow the primers to detect any new SARS-CoV-2 variants that might emerge immaterial of the novel mutations that the variants might have. The primers developed in a way future-proofs the ability to detect without fail any new SARS-CoV-2 variants that may emerge. The Omicron variant, for instance, has 32 mutations in the spike protein alone. None of these mutations were seen in other variants that emerged earlier — the Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta. Each new variant that emerges develops a unique set of mutations that makes it more transmissible and/or causes severe disease.  RT-PCR tests currently available contain primers for two or more genes. The gene targets selected could be a combination of S gene, N gene and E- gene.  Based on over 40,000 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 virus genome sequence data available in the public domain including a significant large number of genome sequences from India, Dr. Sivasubbu’s team, which includes two PhD students — Paras Sehgal and Gyan Ranjan, was able to identify nearly 80,000 unique variants. The high number of variants seen is because SARS-CoV-2 is a rapidly mutating virus and tends to collect mutations during infection. The SARS-CoV-2 is naturally endowed to collect about one mutation every 10-14 days.  “Though the SARS-CoV-2 is a rapidly mutating virus, we found that not all regions of the virus were accumulating mutations at the same rate. There are some regions of the virus which collect mutations at a fast rate while some other regions tend to collect mutations at a slow rate,” says Dr. Sivasubbu.  “We at IGIB already had an algorithm that allowed us to look at the conserved regions that were not prone to accumulating mutations.. This allowed us to analyse which regions of the virus are conserved and which were not,” says Dr. Sivasubbu.  Conserved region of a virus contains genes which are very essential and hence either do not undergo any mutations or such mutations happen rarely.  In parallel, the IGIB researchers had also collected information about primers used in commercial and non-commercial tests across the world. “Once we had the mutation map of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and by using the information gathered by studying the primers used across the world, we found that a majority of primers designed and used were overlapping with the regions of the virus collecting significant number of mutations,” he says.  “The primers widely in use have a small strategic problem. We realised that at some point in the future, the existing primers used in RT-PCR test kits for detecting SARS-CoV-2 virus would not be able to bind properly to the genome leading to erroneous results,” Dr. Sivasubbu says. The primers were tested to detect all the SARS-CoV-2 variants — the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron. Based on the knowledge of the conserved regions in the virus, the team developed a pool of primers that would be future-proof. Each RT-PCR test uses at least two gene targets and each gene target requires a pair of primers. The pool of primers developed by IGIB will allow them to be used in various combinations.  “The pool of primers has been developed to target regions of the virus which are unlikely to undergo mutations. So the primers developed for RT-PCR tests will perform very well when new variants emerge,” says Dr. Anurag Agrawal, Director of IGIB.  The development of the mutation map of SARS-CoV-2 virus and the pool of primers were done in collaboration with Siemens Healthcare Private Limited. The technology has been transferred to the company and the product tested and approved by ICMR and launched on January 25 this year. Siemens will be manufacturing the tests (IMDX SARS-CoV-2 Multiplex ORF1ab/N gene) at its new plant at Vadodara. According to the company spokesperson, the tests have 100% sensitivity and specificity. The plant has a capacity to manufacture 12 million tests per month. “The company will strive to make it affordable and accessible,” the spokesperson said.  The project began in May–June 2020 when Illumina launched its new Covidseq Next-Generation Sequencing for SARS-CoV-2 virus and the first global field validation was carried out in India at IGIB. Nearly 1,700 genome sequence samples from seven States were sequenced at IGIB using Covidseq Next-Generation Sequencing as part of the field validation. Once the field validation by IGIB was completed, countries across the world started using Illumina’s new Covidseq genome sequencing protocol. By the end of December 2020, a large number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes were sequenced across the world, including 7,000 from India. Of the 7,000 genomes sequenced in India, 50% were exclusively by IGIB in collaboration with other entities in India. ",R.

332,"February 04, 2022",05:51 IST,sci-tech,health,"Exposure to a single nasal droplet can cause COVID, finds study"," Exposure to a single nasal droplet may be sufficient to cause COVID-19 infection, according to a landmark trial in the U.K., in which healthy volunteers were intentionally given a dose of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.  The collaborative study is the first in the world to perform detailed monitoring over the full course of COVID-19, from the moment a person first encounters SARS-CoV-2, throughout the infection to the point at which the virus is apparently eliminated. Among several key clinical insights, researchers found that symptoms start to develop very fast, on average about two days after contact with the virus.  They also found that infection first appears in the throat, infectious virus peaks about five days into infection and, at that stage, is significantly more abundant in the nose than the throat.  The team also found that lateral flow tests are a reassuringly reliable indicator of whether infectious virus is present — whether they are a likely to be able to transmit virus to other people.  The findings, published on
Nature’ s pre-print server and which have not yet been peer-reviewed, detail the outcomes in 36 healthy, young participants with no immunity to the virus.
 The study shows that experimental infection of volunteers is reproducible and resulted in no severe symptoms in healthy young adult participants. Participants were exposed to the lowest possible dose of virus found to cause infection, roughly equivalent to the amount found in a single droplet of nasal fluid when they were at their most infectious.  The research lays the groundwork for future studies to test new vaccines and medicines against COVID-19.  “First and foremost, there were no severe symptoms or clinical concerns in our challenge infection model of healthy young adult participants,” said Christopher Chiu, professor at Imperial College London and Chief Investigator on the trial.  ""People in this age group are believed to be major drivers of the pandemic and these studies, which are representative of mild infection, allow detailed investigation of the factors responsible for infection and pandemic spread,"" Mr. Chiu said.  In the trial, 36 healthy male and female volunteers aged 18-30 years, unvaccinated against COVID-19 and with no prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 were given a low dose of the virus -- introduced via drops up the nose.  They were carefully monitored by clinical staff in a controlled environment over a two-week period.  The study used virus from very early in the pandemic obtained from a hospitalised patient, prior to the emergence of the Alpha variant.  Half of the volunteers became infected, 16 of whom went on to develop mild-to-moderate cold-like symptoms, including a stuffy or runny nose, sneezing, and a sore throat.  Some experienced headaches, muscle aches, tiredness and fever, while none developed serious symptoms.  There were no changes seen in their lungs, or any serious adverse events in any participant.  All participants will be followed up for 12 months after leaving the clinical facility to monitor for any potential long-term effects. Among the 18 infected participants, the average time from first exposure to the virus to viral detection and early symptoms was 42 hours, significantly shorter than existing estimates, which put the average incubation period at 5-6 days, researchers said.  Following this period there was a steep rise in the amount of virus found in swabs taken from participants’ nose or throat, they said.  These levels peaked at around five days into infection on average, but high levels of infectious virus were still picked up in lab tests up to nine days after inoculation on average, and up to a maximum of 12 days for some, supporting the isolation periods advocated in most guidelines.  There were also differences in where the most virus was found. While the virus was detected first in the throat, significantly earlier than in the nose, levels were lower and peaked sooner in the throat, according to the researchers.  Peak levels of virus were significantly higher in the nose than in the throat, indicating a potentially greater risk of virus being shed from the nose than the mouth.  This highlights the importance of proper face mask use to cover both the mouth and nose, they added.", PTI,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/exposure-to-a-single-nasal-droplet-can-cause-covid-finds-study/article38373132.ece

But it was replaced with another cat to continue the practice. This popular Zen tale illustrates the absurdity that can result from following orders unquestioned. There is a cop in Taanakkaran who is much like the ritual cat. He stands guard over a tree inside a police campus because, years ago, when the tree was a sapling, a superior cop had ordered one of his subordinates to guard it against goats. Unlike the cat story, here, the people involved are aware of the absurdity. Yet they never challenge the status quo, as they are a part of a system that abhors questioning and appreciates obedience. Tamizh, who has written and directed the film (his first), before starting the story, gives a brief explainer about the Indian police system, which was created by the colonial regime to serve its interests, but has continued to be hierarchical, and sometimes even inhumane. Tamil filmmakers usually resort to making their cops as testosterone-charged, trigger-happy vigilantes, who are immune to laws of physics and human rights violations . Tamizh, instead of resorting to this good-cop, bad-cop game, is keen on critiquing the system through a sober story set in a police training centre. The training camp setting itself is new to Tamil cinema cops, whom we usually see outdoors or in police stations. The camp, located in Pozhilaru, Tirunelveli, in 1998, is a character in itself. It has a barren parade ground, parched under the sun, without a smidgen of shade. The trainees’ rooms pale in comparison with prisons. Their toilets can be claustrophobic. And, the ratio of trainees to toilets is about 70:1. The facilities at the camp, however, are not as unforgiving as one of its training officers, Eshwaramurthy (played by Lal). He is someone who likes discipline… or rather, who likes to discipline. Though he is not the most superior officer, he has a reputation for being ruthless. Arivu (Vikram Prabhu), one of the trainees, questions his authority (albeit unintentionally). This sets up the film’s conflict well: the face of the system that hates being questioned versus the one who questions. Tamizh, however, does not make Arivu a typical mass hero. Unlike other commercial cop flicks in Tamil, the heroism of Arivu does not lie in his charisma but in his perseverance. There are no screaming punchlines, just silent resilience. We also get a solid flashback that explains his motivation to endure. Vikram Prabhu fits this role well. The only bits that were jarring with respect to his character were a couple of scenes when the character becomes a tad melodramatic. The romantic angle with Anjali Nair, who plays an officer at the camp, does not lead anywhere and could have been done away with. In fact, a mushy song kills the gritty mood of the intense camp setting. The casual body-shaming of another character was also a buzzkill in a movie that strives to discuss what is right.   Despite having a sole protagonist, the secondary characters get ample screen space as well. And, most of the actors do a fine job, especially MS Bhaskar as a cop who has been wronged by the system but has to remain subservient to it.  Lal’s character is more interesting. He appears a bit unidimensional at the beginning but as the film progresses, we realise he too but a cog in the wheel. In the end, Arivu realises he isn’t battling an individual but a century-old system. Even the ckimatic sense of triumph is subdued in Tamizh’s promising debut. The hero cannot defeat the system but he can make it a bit better.  ‘Taanakkaran’ is streaming on Disney+ Hotstar",Praveen Sudevan,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/taanakkaran-review-vikram-prabhu/article65302755.ece
334,"April 08, 2022",16:50 IST,entertainment,reviews,Avial review: A muddled coming-of-age drama," A protagonist’s evolution can be due to various factors, but going by some of the recent movies with coming-of-age themes, it happens mainly due to a series of relationships. In Shanil Muhammed’s Aviyal too, that does not change much with the script focusing on four phases from the life of the protagonist Krishnan, each representing a different relationship.  The film is structured as a conversation between musician Krishnan (Joju George) and his daughter (Anaswara Rajan). To console the daughter who is down and out after a break-up, he begins recounting events from his life on the drive back home. Although one cannot be sure whether he intended these as life lessons (for most of it sound like cautionary tales), the daughter, to her credit, does pass some deservedly harsh judgements on her father’s past conduct.  The duo has mostly a cameo appearance, with debutant Sirajudeen Nazar making his presence felt as Krishnan, undergoing convincing transformations through the four phases of his life. The newcomer’s performance and transformations, from a school boy to a lazy college student to a drug-addicted rock musician to a drunkard who becomes a burden for his wife, are some of the few positives of the film. He has pulled off a role that seasoned actors would dream of, bringing about complete changes in body language to reflect his growth. But this time-consuming effort is not backed by some solid writing that could have gone a long way towards elevating the film. Shanil Muhammed, who wrote and co-directed the delightful ‘Philips And The Monkey Pen’, makes a patchy effort here with his pen. He has written some convincing initial portions, when the protagonist is at school and college, but the script becomes rather muddled and shallow, ironically as the protagonist grows up. The four women in these four phases, except one, do not even have much scope for performance.  It is commendable that Krishnan is not shown in a positive light all through, although he is narrating his life story to his daughter, but it would seem there is nothing else to his life except the few women whom he came across. For a musician, even the music becomes a sideshow, used almost always in the movie as means for Krishnan to impress women. That could possibly be why they forgot to fill up the blanks in the end, to tell us how he became the level-headed musician that he is now. The phase of his life that showcases him as a drowned-in-drugs rock musician in Goa also becomes the weakest link of the film.  Aviyal’s narrative, showing the transformation of a young innocent boy into a decadent, angsty youth on the way to become a sober adult, takes a familiar route. Only parts of that life story appeal to us, while the absence of an impactful event remains as a downer.  Aviyal is currently running in theatres",S.R.

335,"April 08, 2022",16:48 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘Ghostwire: Tokyo’ game review: Intriguing storyline with superb graphics but let down by bland combat," Tokyo has been the setting of a few popular alternate reality stories in games and series over the last two decades. Sample: The World Ends With You, Persona 5, and the Netflix show  Alice in Borderland. In all these stories, the city that inspired Cyberpunk turns into a virtual sandbox where anything goes. Joining this list is Ghostwire: Tokyo. The game is developed by Tango Gameworks, the brainchild of Shinji Mikami of the popular Resident Evil series.  Tokyo, as the game commences, is empty. It is invaded by Yokai (known as the Visitors) and the most of the residents have vanished. After a motor accident, the protagonist, Akito, is left for dead. He is, however, saved by a detective’s spirit, named KK, which gives him supernatural powers. KK, through Akito, wants to end the darkness that has engulfed the city. Akito, meanwhile, is more keen on protecting his family — in particular, he wants to save his kidnapped sister, Mari. The conflicts between Akito and KK and the bond they share make Ghostwire: Tokyo’s plot more engaging.  The game is rife with spiritual manifestations that are deeply rooted in Japanese culture. Traversing through Tokyo in the game, you experience its duality — of concrete-and-neon on one hand and old-word shrines on the other. Sometimes, roaming around an empty city reminds you of the lockdown. You get to grapple across rooftops, where some of the most fun elements in the game lie. The game also takes you indoors, where you get to see some of the coolest effects in the form of reality transformation.  The game’s action system is a bit of a letdown. The form of combat in the game is called ethereal weaving, where you cast spells with fancy finger movements, much like Dr Strange in the Marvel films. It looks interesting but after a point, you wish for more depth and dimension in the fighting style. The graphics of the game, however, are smooth as butter. The art is fantastic, too. If you have played a lot of Yakuza games, you will feel right at home. One hopes the developers would tweak the combat style so that the game gets closer to perfection.",Julian Almeida,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/ghostwire-tokyo-game-review/article65299141.ece
336,"April 08, 2022",15:16 IST,entertainment,reviews,Dasvi movie review: A self-conscious spoof seeking grace marks," In the OTT universe, it seems a section of decision makers are taking the genres literally. If it is  dark, even the lighting should make the audience feel the genre. If it belongs to  feel-good, every heart should shine like gold. In the pursuit of labelling their ventures, they seem to forget earnestness helps only when the effort doesn’t show in the final product. This week, we have been saddled with the feel-good variety populated by a plenty of cardboard characters with golden hearts. Mounted as a blend of political satire and social dramedy, it comes across as a self-conscious spoof laced with lame jokes and preachy dialogues on the importance of education. Set around Ganga Ram Chaudhary (Abhishek Bachchan), a semi-literate Chief Minister of a fictitious State somewhere in the vicinity of Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, the idea is promising. Full of contempt for the educated officials around him, Chaudhary’s rollicking life gets a jerk when he finds himself in jail after being convicted for a scam in the appointment of teachers. Drawn from a real-life political story, it raises expectations. However, the troika of writers — Ritesh Shah, Suresh Nair and Sandeep Leyzell — settle for the predictable. Chaudhary anoints his seemingly silent, rustic wife Vimla (Nimrat Kaur) on the CM’s chair with the hope that she would vacate it for him, as soon as the law allows him to reclaim it. With a pliant jailer (Manu Rishi Chaddha) at his service, Chaudhary feels it is just a matter of time, but in comes an honest superintendent Jyoti Deswal (Yami Gautam Dhar) who makes Chaudhary follow the jail manual. Looking for a way out from the physical task, he decides to appear for the High School examination but soon finds that he has bitten more than he could chew. Meanwhile, his simple wife develops a fondness for power and decides to cling on to it, come what may. It is an interesting, almost ‘Hiranisque’ puzzle to solve, but the way debutant director Tushar Jalota goes about it makes the film feel like a long-drawn college skit that scores on intent, but fails on execution. The intrinsic logic doesn’t work as after the build-up, and Chaudhary doesn’t fit into the frame of a Hindi heartland politician coming across as a severely watered-down reflection of the complex reality. The equation with his wife reminds of the web series  Maharani which was much more layered and fun to watch . Chaudhary’s transformation is also rather simplistic and his novel efforts to learn Mathematics, Social Science and English — the heart of the story — evoke only a passive response. In between, the writers tick the usual feel-good boxes of gender, caste discrimination and dyslexia but fail to sandwich the message in the layers of comedy. Playing safe, they even match the castes of Chaudhary and Deswal, and keep Nehru out of the history lessons. Once again, Abhishek is earnest and eager to experiment, but has been tasked with bringing life to a cardboard crying for attention. He has worked on the lingo but hasn’t chewed it well enough to make the diction feel natural. The ever-reliable Chaddha shows how to do it. Abhishek also suffers because of the stagy atmosphere. Jalota employs the pace and techniques of Comedy Circus to paper over the cracks in writing, but it doesn’t work. Nimrat and Yami are competent performers who also suffer because of under-written parts. In the second half, things do look up a bit and there are certain portions that might work for children. A few more drafts, a little more attention to detail could have made the inspiring idea brim with life. As of now,  Dasvi requires a lot of grace marks to sail through.

337,"April 08, 2022",15:12 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘Ghani’ movie review: A muddle of a narrative," Ideally, a film should not be viewed and discussed as the first and second halves. The narrative needs to work as a whole. In the case of the Telugu film Ghani, the attention to screenplay is so starkly different in the two halves that it becomes tough to view the film as one whole entity. The film takes off post intermission, unravelling power play and politics in a sport that in turn sets the stage for emotional drama.  It is a story of identity, revenge and good over evil, mounted on a grand scale to present actor Varun Tej in a new avatar. The sports portions hold attention even though the narrative does not break new ground. But the first half is so lamely written that it makes the later portions appear like a breath of fresh air. Events that happen in 2004, involving boxers Vijayendra Sinha (Suniel Shetty) and Vikramaditya (Upendra) become the trigger for the story. Vikramaditya is disgraced and his family bears the brunt. The mother (Nadiya as Madhuri) makes her young son Ghani (child artiste Ronit Kamra from Jersey) promise that he will never take to boxing. It does not take much to predict that Ghani will grow up to be a boxer (Varun Tej). The first hour rolls about aimlessly. Ghani is introduced through a sporting stunt sequence to establish that he cannot stay away from boxing. He is driven by the motive to make his mother’s heart swell with pride and get over the past. Before he can do that, he has to lock horns with a rich brat Aadi (Naveen Chandra) who, incidentally, is also a boxer. Never mind if eventually, Aadi seems like a pale opponent compared to the other demons Ghani has to take on. The story also weaves in laughable romance. The way a few shots are captured in the university corridor is reminiscent of Tholi Prema (2018) but this romance is not half as breezy. Maya (Saiee Manjrekar)’s character is so weakly written and some of her lines induce unintentional laughs in the theatre. Her inexperience in emoting does not help either. When she asks Ghani how he has put up with so much pain, someone in the hall remarked ‘painkiller’. The laughs that followed spliced through the boredom until that point. In these portions, Varun Tej also looked lost, as though wondering when he can return to the boxing ring. The film gets into its groove post intermission. The crucial reveal about Ghani’s father brings two men into the picture — boxer-turned-coach Vijayendra and Eeshwar (Jagapathi Babu) who calls the shots in the Indian Boxing League. Ghani’s father’s backstory gives the story the required emotional depth. But it is tough to fathom why Madhuri never had a frank conversation with her son and shared whatever she knew about her husband. It is also hard to believe that Ghani managed to hide his boxing until the state championships, in this age of traditional and social media spotlight. The training sessions between Ghani and Vijayender work well and address why the player needs to stay focussed and not give in to emotional outbursts on provocation. The betting racket brings in the masala. Cinematography by George C Williams sets the mood in the boxing ring along with Thaman’s rousing ‘takeover Ghani’ score. However, there is not much of a surprise as the story moves forward and you can sense how each character would behave.  Take Jagapathi Babu’s character for instance. He has done such roles so often in the past that he looks bored. Varun Tej flaunts a chiselled physique and looks agile enough to play a sportsperson. He displays the required aggression while also managing to retain the innocence of an emerging player. Suniel Shetty, Upendra, Nadiya and Naveen Chandra do justice to the parts given to them. Despite all the sporting action, the film gets talk heavy. At one point, when one character smirks at another for being a better talker than a sportsman, it elicits laughs..

338,"April 08, 2022",13:15 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore’ movie review: Magnificent Mikkelsen... and then some ho-hum," Despite the negative publicity (Johnny Depp’s court case and J.K. Rowling’s views on trans people) and the feeling that enlarging the Wizarding World franchise is an exercise in greed,  Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore is actually rather entertaining.   This is third film of the series outlining the adventures of magi zoologist Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) following  Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016) and  Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald (2018). Yates returns for director duties as does Rowling for screenplay. Scamander’s tome is often mentioned in the Harry Potter books as one of the prescribed textbooks at Hogwarts, though Scamander does not appear in any of the books or movies.  Set in the 1930s, the movie opens with a meeting between two powerful wizards Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law) and Gellert Grindelwald (Mads Mikkelsen). They were once close, sharing love, a vision of how the world should be, and a blood pact that prevents them from duelling against each other. The two have since walked separate paths, with Dumbledore dazzling the wizarding world with his brilliance and teaching Defence against Dark Arts at Hogwarts, while Grindelwald preaches hatred, intolerance and bigotry.   Apart from Scamander, Team Dumbledore includes the muggle baker and WWI vet, Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler); Theseus (Callum Turner), Scamander’s older brother, who works in the British Ministry of Magic; Lally Hicks (Jessica Williams) who teaches at the Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry; Yusuf Kama (William Nadylam) who once was on the other side and has since seen the error of his ways, and Scamander’s assistant, Bunty (Victoria Yeates).  The stakes in  Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore (what are his secrets?) do not seem very high. The big battle in the film is for the ballot. After being acquitted of all his crimes against humanity, Grindelwald is standing for elections for the Supreme Head of the International Confederation of Wizards. Credence (Ezra Miller) going through identities at a dizzying pace does not add up to much, and the big reveal of his truest self is slightly ho-hum.  There are magical creatures, including the sweet qilin and a thrilling rescue. Moving the action to Bhutan is quite inspired. And while shoving in Hogwarts, a snitch, the Slytherins, John Williams’ score and McGonagall (Fiona Glascott) might be just that wee bit manipulative, it can be forgiven as we are all slaves to nostalgia. Whether it is enough for two more films is the question. If all else fails, there is Mikkelsen’s magnificent sneer.   Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore is currently running in theatres  ",Mini Anthikad Chhibber,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/fantastic-beasts-the-secrets-of-dumbledore-movie-review-magnificent-mikkelsen-and-then-some-ho-hum/article65302047.ece
339,"April 07, 2022",16:24 IST,entertainment,reviews,"‘Moonshot’ movie review: Cole Sprouse stars in good-natured, goofy space ride"," Just when you thought romcoms were a dying breed comes the delightful  Moonshot. And it is such a relief to see Cole Sprouse as a jolly doofus after enduring six seasons and 103 episodes of purple prose and angst, courtesy Jughead in  Riverdale.   Sprouse plays Walt, an assistant barista on a college campus. He dreams of going to Mars but does not have the requisite gazillion dollars to buy the ticket. Even after eccentric billionaire Leon Kovi (Zach Braff) launches the Kovi Student Mars Programme, his applications are rejected 37 times as he does not have the know-how or the skills required.    Into this sad life, which involves dealing with snarky robot boss, Gary (Peter Woodward), comes Ginny (Emily Rudd), who needs just that little push to take up the Mars relocation. At the same party where Walt meets Ginny, he also meets Sophie (Lana Condor). Sophie’s boyfriend, Calvin (Mason Gooding), is on Mars, working on a hectic project.   A few weeks later, Walt meets a tearful Sophie at the coffee shop. Sophie is upset that Calvin will be staying longer in Mars, contrary to the two’s well worked-out ‘plan’ for the future. Sophie has the money to buy a ticket to Mars, but has a fear of flying.       Walt has a cunning plan and convinces Sophie to buy a ticket and sneak him on to the space shuttle. Once on board, it is obvious that Walt’s stowaway plan is not going to work and the two have to pretend to be a couple to avoid discovery.  There is nothing startlingly different about  Moonshot that we have not seen in a million other romcoms, but it is all so good-natured, that you cannot help but grin along. Condor seems an extension of her Lara Jean character from  To All the Boys... and the little jig she does to quell her anxiety before take-off is charming. Michelle Buteau as Captain Tarter is a bag of jokes.   While not being particularly original, with likeable leads and a sci-fi twist that is not time travel, backed by acceptable movie logic,  Moonshot is a cheery way to spend time.   Moonshot is currently streaming on Amazon Prime Video ",Mini Anthikad Chhibber,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/moonshot-movie-review-cole-sprouse-stars-in-good-natured-goofy-space-ride/article65298905.ece
340,"April 02, 2022",15:42 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘Manmatha Leelai’ movie review: There is nothing for adults in this Venkat Prabhu quickie," Two similarly constructed incidents run parallel at two different timelines in Venkat Prabhu’s Manmatha Leelai. Both involve Sathya (Ashok Selvan) stepping out of his boundary to get physical with two women, Poorani (Samyuktha Hegde) and Leela (Riya Suman). They are intercut to show the similar nature of the scenes, but this spoon feeding gets tiring after a point.  The first half is entirely built on these two parallel tracks, stretched to a point beyond redemption. What is outstanding about the core idea of Manmatha Leelai, a film which claims to be an ‘adult comedy’, is the lack of an idea (story is by Manivannan Balasubramaniam). What is adult or comedy about these individual events is left to our imagination. Do let us know in the comments section. The common thread you encounter is adultery. There are two kinds of extramarital affairs in Manmatha Leelai; one you foresee and the other hits you in the face — definitely not in a manner you would imagine. The second one though might sound outrageously funny, indulges in the blame game, deriving jokes at the expense of a woman, of course.  In the first storyline, which takes place in 2010, Sathya appears to be dating Poorani via Orkut. They haven’t met in the real world. Poorani is that paavam girl we have to sympathise with. She is dressed as a typical Tamil woman getting ready for her mudhal iravu (first night) when Sathya meets her. But she somehow transforms into a model for a condom ad in the same scene.  Leela’s role is even better. She looks like she ran out of Splitsvilla even before she gave a shot. By some miracle, she lands up at Sathya’s doorstep on a rainy evening. Both these women serve the purpose to titillate the audience more than Sathya. Except for a few scenes, thankfully, the film doesn’t objectify them to a disturbing proportion, like in Santhosh P Jayakumar’s films.  There is a third woman, Anu (Smruthi Venkat), the classic nagging wife of Sathya.  These are, of course, not a problem, given that ‘adult comedy’, historically speaking, has only been catering to the male crowd. There is very little here for women to enjoy. That said, wait for the last half hour to kick in. We shall see if you recover from it. Sensitivity is the least you would expect in an adult comedy. I, sure, wasn’t. But the manner in which adultery is dealt with, to make it presentable and cool, raises concern about whether it was made for self-respecting adults or a gullible ‘youth’ crowd.  If anything, it shows that for two consulting adults to have sex, even if it were in an affair gone wrong, you need to show alcohol as an excuse to accentuate their intimacy. Sex, without alcohol, is deemed sinful apparently. Manmatha Leelai also illustrates that a mere ‘quickie’ just does not work if both parties involved rush through the process, not letting things develop organically. This film was initially planned for a streaming platform, which has become a dump yard for such lacklustre efforts. Manmatha Leelai is that film you wouldn’t bother checking out, even if the streaming platform’s algorithm throws it at you.",Srivatsan S,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/manmatha-leelai-movie-review/article65284147.ece
341,"April 02, 2022",14:31 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘Kaun Pravin Tambe?’ movie review: The late bloomer deserves a chance," In the last few years, sports biopics in Hindi cinema have become like an Indian Premier League game where the director wants the audience to be the cheerleader dancing to a rousing background score. Most of them only showcase the making of a star. There is hardly any space for the stories of hundreds of those talented and determined players who could not make it to the top leagues and are casually labeled under-achievers. The algorithm-like screenplays of such films have little space for the struggle with self-doubts and inner demons that often hinder a sportsperson’s growth in the cutthroat environment. This week is an exception, as director Jayprad Desai traces the life and times of Pravin Tambe who kept slogging away in the local division leagues for years in the hope that one day he would make it to the Mumbai Ranji squad. Here is the story of an underdog who doesn’t necessarily want to be the top dog by the climax. Ultimately, he catches the eye of Rahul Dravid, who perhaps carries a Tambe inside him, and is picked for the Indian Premier League. By that time Tambe has crossed 40 but, as one of the selectors says, his battery is fully charged. As Tambe hits the stumps and makes it to the headlines, the adjective quickly spins from under-achiever to late bloomer. More than the action on the ground, how the man from Mulund keeps fueling his modest dream makes for a riveting watch. The moments with his family, friends, and coach create an enchanting tapestry of emotions that make you believe in honesty, hard work, and a dash of luck. Screenwriter Kiran Yadnyopavit generates situations that feel light but penetrate the conscience. Tambe does odd jobs to keep the kitchen running and sells his man of the match prizes to pay for the school fees of his son, but the most interesting segment is the one where his coach Vidyadhar Paradkar (Ashish Vidyarthi) tries to turn the medium-pacer into a leg spinner. Imagine a Bharatanatyam dancer being asked to perform Kathak one day; it provides an insight into a player’s mind in popular idiom and the role of a good coach on the ground called life. In one of the finest examples of truthful acting, Shreyas Talpade embodies Tambe’s never-say-die spirit and provides an interesting counterpoint in these Yo-Yo times when players are expected to wear their attitude on their short sleeves. It is not just the bowling action, Shreyas showcases Tambe’s unflinching attitude with no artifice. In a way, Tambe’s career graph is similar to Shreyas’, as the actor also could not make it to the next level despite being consistently good and persevering.  As Iqbal (2005), he has been on the pitch before, but Shreyas ensures that Tambe doesn’t evoke the memory of Iqbal. It is his sincere performance that keeps us glued even when the screenplay becomes flabby and the storytelling fumbles. In sports journalist Sanyal (Parambrata Chatterjee), writer Kiran Yadnyopavit has created a flaky obstacle in the path of Tambe. He could have been just one of the voices to represent the ecosystem, but Desai gives too much importance to a journalist who is simply jealous of Tambe’s fortitude. Curiously, the film doesn’t discuss the new-found utility of ‘all rounders’, with the advent of T-20 cricket where age is not as much a factor as in a five-day game. Once called bits-and-pieces players for the traditional format, the Indian Premier League has helped them find a footing in all forms of cricket. Curiously, Tambe got to play Ranji after his IPL debut. It doesn’t talk about the need for characters in dugouts whose interesting backstories could fill the honey story space on news pages. The film also doesn’t address why a journalist would block the path of a cricketer who could become a good copy. More importantly, the background score doesn’t go with the heartfelt performances. It strikes the same stock tunes that forces the discerning audience to press the mute button. Maybe the director wants to showcase the not-so-sophisticated milieu where Tambe belongs, but, still, it doesn’t go with the personality of the film. Having said that, Desai has populated the screen space with a competent support cast. Anjali Patil (as Tambe’s wife Vaishali), Chhaya Kadam (Tambe’s mother), and Vidyarthi ensure that there is no miscommunication while running between the wickets and the late bloomer gets his due.

342,"April 02, 2022",13:33 IST,entertainment,reviews,"‘Morbius’ movie review: A quick, insipid story with bland special effects"," While Jared Leto as Dr Michael Morbius and Matt Smith as Milo are fun to watch, the same cannot be said about the rest of the movie. The film is an  origin story for Morbius, the Living Vampire, who first appeared in a 1971 issue of  The Amazing Spider-Man as the webslinger’s opponent. Though he started off as a villain, Morbius later became the kind of a flawed, Shakespearean vigilante, which seems to be the default setting for comic-book heroes.  There is enough in Morbius’ story — the genius scientist attempting to cure a rare blood disorder and turning into a vampire in the process — to merit an interesting movie. Unfortunately, that is not this one. What we have is a confused mess that looks vaguely like a ‘90s movie, minus the fun and flying cows (remember  Twister?), of course.  There is something lazy about the narrative, as if everyone was filling in time until a better one comes along. The movie starts in Costa Rica, and the sinister aspects of the place are underlined with the name ending with “de la muerte” which as we all know means “of death”. The big, beefy mercenaries accompanying Morbius are nervous and insist they should leave before dark.  Morbius sends them on their way with a wad of cash and a bunch of vampire bats — nasty. Rewind to 25 years ago and a hospital in Greece. A 10-year-old Morbius greets his latest neighbour, who also suffers from a similar blood disorder. He, incidentally, calls all the boys assigned to the bed adjacent to his, Milo. Whether out of laziness or arrogance is never explained. A friendship forms between the boys. The kind and fatherly director of the hospital, Dr. Emil Nicholas (Jared Harris), arranges for Morbius to study medicine in New York.  Working towards a cure for his illness, Morbius creates synthetic blood, which helps countless people, getting him a Nobel Prize in the bargain. He refuses the Prize because he believes he does not deserve recognition for what was a by-product of a failed experiment. He starts to experiment with the vampire bats, trying to harness their genes to cure his condition. He succeeds beyond belief only with some side effects – fortunate ones like superhuman strength, reflexes and echolocation, and unfortunate ones like turning into a vampire with an insatiable desire for blood.

343,"April 01, 2022",15:46 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘Attack’ movie review: John Abraham doesn’t disappoint as the last man standing," Action always works best when it is backed by emotion. Who knows it better than John Abraham who  Force-d his way into the genre in 2011 with the Nishikant Kamat film? With  Action, he aims for level 2... and doesn’t disappoint. In action films, the emotion is usually revenge, and in debutant director Lakshya Raj Anand’s film, it’s very much the fulcrum. But there is more. For a film whose title explains its intentions in one word, it is not as brutish as the title suggests.  Attack plays out like a smart video game designed for teenagers of all age groups where the soldier — sorry — super soldier hasn’t lost his heart yet in the web of artificial intelligence.   Propelled by the nationalist narrative, the premise doesn’t even test the average intelligence. A terror group with Muslim names has mounted an attack on India. The target is our Parliament. The good thing is Anand doesn’t load us with explainers and hits the ground running. He remains focused on the task at hand in this hostage drama. As the romantic angle is intertwined with action, he doesn’t digress into love songs, and there’s not even an item number to catch the breath. Arjun (John), an Army major, who has been almost reduced to a vegetable in a terror attack, is asked by his mentor Subramanium (Prakash Raj) to undergo a risky experiment that would transform him into a one-man army and provide him an opportunity to save his country and avenge the death of his beloved (Jacqueline Fernandez). Unlike the cyborgs that Hollywood factories unleash on us, Arjun retains some human emotions beneath a chiseled body. When he grapples to live with his artificial robotic assistant IRA, the film gets some refreshing light moments. When he struggles with his inner demons, we sense what it could have been. This solider carries a chip in his cerebellum, not on his shoulder. The potential has not been fully realised, and leaves a lot of scope for a sequel. Taut and fast-paced, the action choreography is closer to the stuff that Hollywood offers and the electric background score provides reason for the adrenaline glands to make their presence felt. The best part is whenever Lakshya takes a leap of faith, it doesn’t look fake, particularly, when the action shifts to the Parliament House. The cinematography is fluid as the camera judiciously moves from tight close-ups to the long shots. Drone cameras have become a fad these days, but cinematographers Will Humpris, P.S. Vinod and Soumik Mukherjee don’t go for the overkill. The politics of the war room is at times problematic, sometimes even juvenile, but good fun in the context of the film. When Prakash Raj says yesterday’s fiction is today’s fact, we know what it means. The writers (John is one of them) have loaded Arjun with so much trauma that John doesn’t need to express much. We are just expected to get it! When John, who has also co-produced the film, is with Jacqueline in the frame, we know who has the greater possibility to have an acting muscle. And the moment action becomes a one-dimensional word, John is our man. He is credible as the last man standing.  Prakash Raj is solid as ever. Rakul Preet Singh as the scientist is saddled with an under-written part, as is veteran Kiran Kumar. As the crude North Indian politician, Rajat Kapoor attempts to play against the type, but falters. It is Elham Ehsas as the counter force Hamid Gul, who is also fighting a personal battle in the guise of faith, that provides meat to the action. The London-based actor has played variants of Gul in international productions. Here, he is believable as the face of terror who perhaps carries a pusillanimous heart. Overall, if the audience can suspend their disbelief after the pandemic for two hours,  Action is a nationalist substitute for PubG, plus a heart that hasn’t stopped beating, yet. Attack is currently playing in theatres. ",Anuj Kumar,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/attack-movie-review-john-abraham-doesnt-disappoint-as-the-last-man-standing/article65281164.ece
344,"April 01, 2022",15:11 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘Mishan Impossible’ movie review: A humorous mission," A week after S S Rajamouli’s RRR comes the story of three boys Raghupathi, Raghava and Rajaram (Harsh Roshan, Bhanu Prakash and Jayateertha Molugu) who call themselves ‘RRR’. Mishan Impossible releasing in theatres on the heels of the NTR-Ram Charan film and its protagonists basking in a similar moniker is incidental. At the heart of it is a story that combines the innocence of these small-town boys and something that lies in darker territory.  After  Agent Sai Srinivasa Athreya, Swaroop RSJ takes the crime comedy route once again but skillfully steers into a new space. In 2014, three boys from Patna leaving home in the hope of nabbing Dawood Ibrahim and winning a handsome reward from the government of India made headlines. Inspired by this true event, Swaroop fashions a fictional tale and reimagines it in the context of boys hailing from Vadamalapeta near Tirupathi. Parallel to the journey of this trio is the story of an investigative journalist and activist Shailaja (Taapsee Pannu) and Vikram (Ravindra Vijay) who are on a mission to bust a child trafficking racket. Much of the first hour is centred on the three boys Raghupathi is a die-hard film buff who idolises Ram Gopal Varma, Raghava wants to win big in Meelo Evaru Kooteswarudu (Kaun Banega Crorepati). Never mind if he delivers wrong answers with unshakeable confidence. The spelling ‘Mishan’ is also his doing. You can either question if no one in the village will call out his bluff or go with the endearing narrative and laugh it off. And Rajaram wants to be a fast bowler like Malinga but all his batsmen end up hitting him for a six.  The world of these three ‘R’s brims with innocence and humour similar to Cinema Bandi and Supermen of Malegaon. The witty lines keep coming one after the other and most of the gags seem believable in the context of the characters. To cite just an example, while other students recall the names of scientists in class, Raghupathi can only think of Vaseegaran (Rajinikanth as a scientist in Endhiran). The film-centered humour is Mishan’s highlight. The segment where the boys plan their mission taking cues from storylines of Trivikram Srinivas, Sukumar, Rajamouli and Puri Jagannadh is hilarious. Swaroop also tips his hat to indigenous jugad in the way the villagers record a cricket match and play back the footage for umpiring.  The real test of the story begins when these boys set out to nab Dawood Ibrahim. Swaroop uses the small characteristics that define the boys to a good advantage when they are thrown into the deep end. When they cross paths with Taapsee and embark on a dangerous mission, several questions arise. There are a few glaring loopholes and the timeline of the hunt for Dawood is anachronistic but a few other smarter touches, like how the Rubik’s cube and other toys of the kids are used through the mission, keep us invested. Both Taapsee and Ravindra Vijay graciously play supporting parts and let the boys take centre stage. The film belongs to them while several others including Rishab Shetty, Suhas, Sandeep Raj and Harsha Chemmudu appear in cameos. The actors who play the parents of the boys are also adequate. Mark Robin’s playful background score and Deepak’s camera stay true to the milieu. The narrative also easily blends in Telugu, Tamil, Kannada and Hindi as warranted through the boys’ journey. The film is far from perfect but can leave you with a big smile.",Sangeetha Devi Dundoo,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/mishan-impossible-movie-review-a-humorous-mission/article65277613.ece
345,"March 31, 2022",15:57 IST,entertainment,reviews,"‘Selfie’ movie review: This GV Prakash, Gautham Menon-starrer needed more focus"," Tamil cinema has thrown up several campus stories. College romance? We've seen it. Hostel experiences? That too.  Reminiscing about college life? Bah, been there, done that.  This 'what happens after we get into college' has been chronicled in several on-screen episodes. Selfie, the latest Mathi Maaran directorial starring GV Prakash and Gautham Menon, chooses to explore the 'how we get into college' phase.  Kanal (GV Prakash), from a small town, wants to get into business but his father has only one goal: to see his son as an engineer. He spends a lot of money, even pawning some of his wife's jewels to ensure that Kanal gets a seat in a prestigious college in Chennai. What happens when Kanal realises that the money paid for his seat was actually because of many middlemen and agents involved in the process? And so, sensing a lot of money in it, he becomes an agent himself. What happens when he crosses paths with Ravi Varma (Gautham Menon), whose word is final for everyone involved in the business of education? As a subject idea, Selfie delves into a subject that is rarely in the public eye, leave alone films. Mathi Maran deserves credit for not only taking it up, but also keeping the screenplay as racy as possible so as to not miss audience interest. However, he misses out on a few counts, especially because of a 'filmi first half' that features a romance that has no place here, and performances that do not always hit the right note. GV Prakash is a good fit as an angry young college going youngster, but the casting of Gautham Menon seems like a misstep. He looks out of place in unfamiliar mileu, and tries to salvage that by sounding 'local', which does not work most of the time. Vagai Chandrasekar scores as GV Prakash's father, but the romance between the leads is also very perfunctory, with Varsha Bollama's dubbing out of sync.  For a film like this to click, the face-off between the male protagonists needs to have far more depth. The climax also comes across as a rushed job, rather than a detailed one.

346,"March 30, 2022",17:52 IST,entertainment,reviews,"‘Bridgerton’ Season 2 review: A rather tepid, less sexy sophomore effort"," The second season of  Bridgerton does not have the rakish Duke of Hastings (Regé-Jean Page) and hardly any sex. There, I have said it. What it does have is the Viscount Bridgerton, Anthony (Jonathan Bailey), looking for a wife. He fixes his eye on the lovely Edwina Sharma (Charithra Chandran), who Queen Charlotte (Golda Rosheuvel) names the diamond for the season. Unfortunately Edwina’s sister, Kate (Simone Ashley), is always in the way making things difficult for the couple.    We learn that the girls’ mother, Lady Mary (Shelley Conn), shocked her stick-in-the-mud parents, the Sheffields, by marrying Sharma, who apart from being a lowly clerk, was a widower with a daughter, Kate. Lady Mary ran off with Sharma to India and lived happily till Sharma died and the mother and daughters were left with nothing.   Kate takes on the burdens of running the family and enters a hare-brained scheme with the Sheffields who promise to provide for Lady Mary and Edwina if she makes an advantageous marriage.    You would think Anthony would be the ticket but Kate is forever wavering — telling Edwina to snub the Viscount and pursue him by turns. Though like The Taming of the Shrew, Kate and Anthony are always sparring, they have feelings for each other which everyone, except the couple, are aware of.   Daphne (Phoebe Dynevor), the eldest Bridgerton daughter, who married the Duke last season, floats by occasionally, which makes the Duke’s absence odder still. Page apparently joined the series on a “one and done” clause. At least they should have mentioned the Duke is travelling, or Daphne should not have made her appearance either.  The other Bridgertons, artist Benedict (Luke Thompson) and traveller Colin (Luke Newton), have their own little troubles. With each season focusing on one of the eight Bridgertons, one cannot be too excited about Benedict and Colin, who do not seem particularly interesting. Anthony, also for that matter, does not seem to be able to set the pulse racing.      Eloise (Claudia Jessie), the fifth Bridgerton, seemed to be interesting with her blue-stocking leanings, but in this season comes off as petulant more than anything else. Also her interest in the printer’s assistant, Theo Sharpe (Calam Lynch), while sweet, is just more vanilla.    The grasping Featheringtons — mama Portia (Polly Walker) and her daughters, Philippa (Harriet Cains), Prudence (Bessie Carter) and Penelope (Nicola Coughlan) — are up to their usual tricks. Portia continues to look for a suitable boy for her girls, while Penelope keeps her ears peeled for grist for her rumour mill. The new Lord Featherington (Rupert Young) might be enormously rich from his ruby mines in the Americas or he might not.    The doyenne of the Ton, Lady Danbury (Adjoa Andoh), spars as usual with the queen and Violet (Ruth Gemmell), the Dowager Viscountess Bridgerton. The queen continues to be obsessed with the identity of Lady Whistledown (voiced by Julie Andrews), does she not have an empire to run?   Based on Julia Quinn’s popular novels,  Bridgerton is set in an alternate, racially-integrated Regency period. If, with the Sharma sisters, the makers were planning to look at colonialism, it seems more yolk than the imperialistic yoke.   If the father was a clerk, how does Edwina remember jolly days in the “palace”? Unless he was palace clerk in some little princedom? The girls, however, talk of Bombay which definitely was not a princely State during the Regency; but well, it is an alternate history.  Referring to their father as  appa while Edwina calls Kate  didi is annoying. Why not  akka or  pitaji and  didi? Even more mystifying is Kate calling Edwina, Bon! What is that—Paris by way of Patna? Kate’s “Indian” name, which is revealed in the finale, is complete nonsense. I am tempted like the colonel in  Catch-22 to demand what kind of name is that.   The production values continue to be high and fashions delicious. The music rather cleverly includes classical versions of pop songs including Nirvana’s ‘Stay Away’, Madonna’s ‘Material Girl’, Miley Cyrus’ ‘Wrecking Ball’ and ‘Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham’ (ugh). However, the sophomore season is rather tepid as we cannot bring ourselves to care about Kate or Anthony—the Darcy-inspired wet shirt notwithstanding.    Bridgerton is presently streaming on Netflix  ",Mini Anthikad Chhibber,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/bridgerton-season-2-review-a-rather-tepid-less-sexy-sophomore-effort/article65273529.ece
347,"March 26, 2022",19:00 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘King Richard’ movie review: A heart-warming triumph of human spirit," Before Richard Williams (Will Smith) there was Mahavir Singh Phogat (Aamir Khan). Remember Nitesh Tiwari’s Dangal (2016)? The film, like  King Richard, told of Phogat, a national-level wrestling champion from a small Haryana village, Balali, putting his daughters, Geeta and Babita, through a punishing training schedule to make them international wrestling champions.  Phogat, like Williams, had to deal with ridicule and prejudice to inspire and guide his girls to the finish line. The finish line is naturally different for us. Our finish line was tears streaming down Phogat’s cheeks as he hears the national anthem and realises Geeta has won the gold at the Commonwealth Games. Williams’ dreams for his tennis prodigy daughters, Venus (Saniyya Sidney) and Serena (Demi Singleton) were slightly different, which is revealed in the epilogue.  At the age of 15, Venus signed a contract for 12 million dollars apart from becoming the first African American woman to be ranked Number One while Serena has won a jaw-dropping 23 Grand Slam titles.  Directed by Reinaldo Marcus Green,  King Richard tells the story of the often controversial and abrasive Williams, who had a plan (85 pages) for his daughters even before they were born. In Compton, Los Angeles, Williams and his wife, Oracene/Brandy (Aunjanue Ellis), coach Venus and Serena, while holding day jobs as security guard and nurse respectively. Williams tries hard to get the girls a coach. He finally convinces Paul Cohen (Tony Goldwyn), while he is coaching John McEnroe (Christopher Wallinger) and Pete Sampras (Chase Del Rey), to have a look at Venus and Serena.    Cohen is impressed and but agrees to coach only Venus for free. That does not stop Williams who records everything and has Brandy train Serena based on the recordings. Williams’ constant comments and corrections during coaching do not particularly endear him to Cohen. Just as Venus is hitting the big league in junior tournaments, and sponsors come sniffing around, Williams decides to pull her out of tournaments fearing that she will be taken advantage of by smooth-talking white businessmen.  Rick Macci (Jon Bernthal), who runs a tennis academy in Florida and trains Jennifer Capriati (Jessica Wacnik), offers Venus a place in his academy. Williams drives a hard bargain and the family move to Florida. The movie ends with Venus turning pro at 14 in October 1994 and taking a set off world champion, Arantxa Sánchez Vicario (Marcela Zacarías) at the Bank of the West Classic tournament.  The film has the Williams sisters’ blessing and could be looked at a version of the truth — was Williams’ ambition for his girls money or to create a path for countless women of colour? Underdog sports stories are always thrilling and tennis is the best kind of eye candy.  King Richards is up for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, actor (it is difficult to see Smith for Williams), supporting actress (Aunjanue Ellis), original screenplay, editing and original song.  While it is depressing that both the Phogat and the Williams sisters needed a man to get them out of Balali and Compton respectively to meet their destiny, it is heart-warming nevertheless to see the triumph of the human spirit.    King Richard is currently running in theatres   ",Mini Anthikad Chhibber,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/king-richard-movie-review-a-heart-warming-triumph-of-human-spirit/article65261917.ece
348,"March 25, 2022",17:23 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘Pam & Tommy’ review: Addictive viewing for its recreation of a time gone by," There is a lot to love and enjoy about Robert Siegel’s  Pam & Tommy. The mini-series tells many stories: the tumultuous relationship between  Baywatch star Pamela Anderson and Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee, the highs and lows of celebrity culture, fin de siècle excesses, the mob and the frontier spirit of the early, burgeoning days of the internet. The fact that all these stories are told engagingly is its greatest strength as well as its most troubling aspect.   Though it purports to tell the story from Anderson’s point of view, the actor did not want to be involved in the show. While showing the damage the tape did to Anderson’s career (she lost out to Kim Bassinger for  LA Confidential and Liz Hurley for  Austin Powers), the show will rekindle interest in the tape all over again, forcing Anderson to relive the trauma. Lee’s support of the show also makes sense as he is presented as a loveable rogue or as a character says, “a sensitive caveman”, with no mention of the spousal abuse that got him jail time.    Pam & Tommy starts with talk show host Jay Leno (Adam Ray) asking Anderson (Lily James) about the tape during what was meant to be an interview about her new movie,  Barb Wire. We then go back to 1995 in Lee’s (Sebastian Stan) Malibu mansion. The construction crew is being driven round the bend with Lee’s last-minute changes. Despite insisting “MINO” (money is no object), Lee does not pay Rand Gauthier (Seth Rogen) and when Gauthier accidentally walks in on Anderson, Lee fires him.   When Gauthier goes back to Lee’s house to retrieve his toolkit, Lee threatens him with a shotgun and tells him he is keeping the tools as collateral for the cost of getting a new crew to redo Gauthier’s shoddy work. A believer in karma, Gauthier feels well within his rights to burgle Lee. After months of planning, Gauthier breaks into Lee’s house and steals a safe. Among all the jewellery, guns and assorted pricey junk in the safe, is a hi8 tape.    Gauthier, who in another life was a porn star, approaches Uncle Miltie, (Nick Offerman) his producer  from the old days, to play the tape. When the two figure out it is a sex tape made by Anderson and Lee during their honeymoon, they realise they are sitting on a goldmine. Their only problem is no adult entertainment store is willing to stock the tape without signed releases from Anderson and Lee for fear of legal action. That is when Gauthier hits the motherlode and decides to harness the power of the internet, unleashing a tsunami that no one can contain.     Pam & Tommy is beautifully acted. James and Stan have literally become Anderson and Lee. Apart from the prosthetics (including an animatronic penis), hair, make-up and tattoos, the two have been able to distil the characteristics of the glamazon and her rockstar husband. While James’ Anderson is a warm, likeable and smart woman with a fondness for rom-coms who wants to have a large family, Stan has channelled Lee’s drug-fuelled excesses, his hair-trigger temper, and his habit of wandering about the house in tiny briefs and having long conversations with his penis, to create a character you might want to hang out with for a little bit.     The others, including Taylor Schilling as Erica, Gauthier’s ex-wife; Andrew Dice Clay as mob guy, Butchie, Mozhan Marnò as Gail Chwatsky, Anderson’s publicist, and Fred Hechinger as Seth Warshavsky, internet wiz-kid, are all characters not caricatures.    Based on the article, “Pam and Tommy: The Untold Story of the World’s Most Infamous Sex Tape”,  Pam & Tommy is addictive viewing for its recreation of a time gone by — of dial-up modems sounding like something Pink Floyd would come up with, MTV, cable television and the Internet.    Pam & Tommy is currently streaming on Disney+Hotstar",Mini Anthikad Chhibber,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/pam-tommy-review-addictive-viewing-for-its-recreation-of-a-time-gone-by/article65258476.ece
349,"March 25, 2022",17:17 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘Achcham Madam Naanam Payirpu’ review: A simple plot let down by poor writing and lead performance," In one type of “women empowerment” film in Tamil cinema, a male star, playing an alpha male, who’s also supposedly woke, tells us what a woman is, how great she is, and why we should celebrate her. Such a film might also have a catchy song, wherein the virtues of women are discussed by… the alpha male, of course. Most often, he will make the woman realise her potential.  In another type, we have leads who are strong and independent women. And, they tell us how women can be, well, strong and independent and walk away, upright, in slow motion. There are other films, albeit very few, like Vasanth Sai’s Sivaranjiniyum Innum Sila Pengalum, which shows stories of a few women – stories that do not scream “women empowerment”, stories that are familiar, stories that are seemingly simple.  The beginning of Raja Rajamurthy’s Achcham Madam Naanam Payirpu gave us an inkling that it belonged to this type. The film opens with a shot of a fish swimming in a round glass bowl. In the out of focus background, we can see a mild breeze flowing into a fairly big curtained window. The film’s composer, Susha, just adds some guitar strings to the shot, making it gentle.  Soon, we are introduced to the protagonist, Pavithra (Akshara Haasan), who is, in a way, like the fish in the bowl. She, too, is bound – by the fear of disappointing the people close to her. Her mother (Malgudi Subha) wants her to emulate her grandmother (Usha Uthup), who is a renowned Carnatic singer. Her father does not like her boyfriend, who is an upcoming cricketer. One of her two close friends disapproves of her desire for pre-marital sex. The other friend disapproves of her not acting on it. In other words, who she is and who she wants to be is defined by the people around her. Not a lot of films in Tamil explore the thoughts and feelings of a woman, especially about sex. So, Raja’s film belongs to the minority. However, in 2022, it is hardly revolutionary. That is fine, because Raja does not intend to make a gravely serious film - the story is simple, the narration light. But the film suffers from poor writing and Akshara’s weak performance. Akshara is supposed to be playing an unsure, awkward adult, but we can mostly see her just pretending to be one. Some of the scenes, which are intended to make the character look cute, end up being cringey due to her performance and writing. Even the supporting characters are unidimensional, neatly fitting into an adjective: dramatic mother, conservative friend, liberal friend, annoying family friend, creepy neighbour… There is even a dog, Pixie, which might as well have been named Plot Device. Films about everyday people usually thrive on layered characters and verisimilitude. This film scores badly on both fronts; the writing of the scene when Pavithra decides to have sex for the first time, for instance, is just one example. After Pavithra’s conflicts have been resolved, we see the fish bowl shot that we saw at the beginning. But it now seems to convey a different meaning: a fish in water. She is comfortable and confident in her own skin. The beginning and the end works, but the things in between, not so much.

350,"March 25, 2022",13:58 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘RRR’ movie review: Beyond the spectacular showmanship," S S Rajamouli has a thing for artistically choreographing chaos. As far as the eye can see, the dusty ground is filled with people wearing large turbans. On the outskirts of Delhi, a protest is brewing and threatening to become a full-fledged rebellion in the aftermath of the arrest of Lala Lajpat Rai. One man gets to the middle of the action and shows people who is the boss. For a split second, a bird’s eye view of this canvas is reminiscent of the battlefield in Baahubali. But then, it is the 1920s and the freedom struggle is brewing in India. People move in on the lone opponent and pile on him, only to understand his tenacity in the next few minutes. This is among the many stunning sequences that show how the stunt directors (Solomon Raju and Nick Powell), junior artistes, the cinematographer (KK Senthil Kumar), the production designer (Sabu Cyril) and the visual effects team (supervised by Srinivas Mohan) have worked in tandem to bring to life the director’s vision.  RRR (Rise, Roar, Revolt) turns out to be a canvas for Rajamouli to scale up his showmanship after Baahubali. He leads us into the film in chapters — the story, the fire, the water… introducing the film’s context and its protagonists Bheem (NTR) and Ram (Ram Charan).  A lengthy disclaimer emphasises that the story is fictional. That gives the filmmaker the liberty to dramatise rather than build a story on the historical characters of Alluri Sitarama Raju and Komaram Bheem. The few years that they had been in oblivion, with no recorded history of their journeys, becomes the film’s canvas. It can be viewed as a coming-of-age story of these freedom fighters but mostly, it is the story of their friendship, anchored sumptuously by M M Keeravani’s Dosti’ song. Quite a bit of the showmanship comes from Keeravani’s score — from the title cards till the very end — as he blends in Indian and western classical, and contemporary beats to give the film a lot more emotional depth than the storytelling manages to. There is a story that can potentially move you, make you weep for the characters — but it lies buried beneath the overarching effort to mount one visual spectacle after another. Rousing introductory sequences for both the stars and an extended pre-interval sequence where their energies, represented by fire and water, collide, are all presented with jaw-dropping visuals, punctuated by the superbly choreographed ‘Naatu naatu’ (‘ Nacho nacho’ in Hindi) song. In the meantime, the sliver of the story that begins in the Adilabad forest languishes on the outskirts of Delhi. The narrative spells out every little detail, leaving little room for disbelief or conceit. For instance, when Ram hides a tear while splashing his face with water after tackling a mob, you know his true intentions and can guess his backstory. Ram’s camaraderie with Bheem and their polar opposite personalities, one being stoic, sophisticated and presenting an impenetrable demeanour while the other is like an open book, giving in to emotional overtures and wearing both his innocence and anger on his sleeve, help in holding interest. NTR, who is easily among the best Telugu actors, delivers a terrific performance. In one scene where he calls himself ‘adavi manishi’ (a tribal man from the jungle), he sums up the characterisation that he so beautifully presents. Be it sparring with a tiger that is terrifically shot or much later holding attention in a Gladiator-like sequence (we shall get to that in a bit), he is in top form. For Charan, this is his best after Rangasthalam and the actor befits his role to the T. His transformation to a warrior is also convincing and he takes it on his shoulders to steer Bheem to a stunning climactic action sequence. The crux of the story comes to the fore in the latter half and at least for some time, tries to give the emotional depth to anchor the extravagant action pieces. The action sequences roll out at regular intervals, transforming the two men into superheroes, like a part Iron man, part Thor or Superman. They can also be victims who are beaten black and blue in front of a bloodthirsty and sneering British power. “There is hardly any blood, hit him harder,” says one character in a scene where a man refuses to kneel and ask forgiveness. While a man is fed to animals in Gladiator, here he becomes fodder for the animal instinct of the rulers. The film is largely about Ram and Bheem, with the help of supporting characters played effectively by Samuthirakani, Rahul Ramakrishna and Shriya Saran among others. Ajay Devgn in an extended cameo gives heft to the larger battle and so does Alia Bhatt in her limited part. Casting her as Sita gives the part credence. I wish there had been more of her in the film. With its run time of more than three hours, RRR tries to present a fictional chapter inspired by real freedom fighters as an epic story. The painstaking effort shows. In contrast, the showmanship flowed more easily in Baahubali. Remember the statue of Bhallaladeva Vs Baahubali in part one and the coronation sequence in part two? Those were effortlessly spellbinding, rather than the much-laboured action spectacles in RRR. RRR made me wonder if in a bid to keep scaling up, Rajamouli the storyteller is taking a backseat. Looking back, he worked with an incredulous idea of a housefly as the hero taunting the villain in Eega (Naan Ee in Tamil and Makkhi in Hindi). It could have become gimmicky had he erred. But it worked so well, making us root for the housefly. All the technical effort was backed by brilliant storytelling, which is sorely missing in RRR. There are small, appreciable flourishes like the British characters not speaking a heavily accented Indian language and sticking to English. A translator is used where needed and in some portions, Rana Daggubati’s voiceover does the needful. But the characterisation of the British parts enacted by Alison Doody and Ray Stevenson remains strictly unidimensional, except Olivia Morris (she is effective and has a good screen presence). Elsewhere, an indigenous bangle gives hope to the tribal child and the yin and yang locket binds Ram and Sita. There is also the effective story of the cost of manufacturing bullets and whether the victims are worth it, which hits the bull’s eye (pardon the pun).

351,"March 20, 2022",17:48 IST,entertainment,reviews,"‘Bachchhan Paandey’ movie review: A laboured adaptation of ‘Jigarthanda,’ this Akshay Kumar flick misses the target"," A gangster with hardly any sob story, Bachchhan Paandey’s (Akshay Kumar) writ runs large on Baagwa, an imaginary dust bowl in the north of India. Somebody, who doesn’t spare even his storyteller, the Awadhi Godfather’s intrepid life inspires a budding filmmaker Myra (Kriti Sanon) to make a gripping biopic. Helped by a friend and a wannabe actor Vishu (Arshad Warsi), the research for the film takes Myra on the trail of crazy henchmen of Paandey. The lure of cinema cracks the hard nuts and Myra gets the script she wants, but in the meantime, Paandey, pushed by Vishu, gets ambitious and decides to be in the film in an “in and as” kind of role. It spirals into further goofy situations interspersed with bloody shootouts. After surviving the antics of the unhinged one-eyed gangster for around 150 minutes, one comes out with the message that fear is an overvalued asset in the hands of a ruler. And that the message lies in the hands of the one who holds the strings of the puppet. Yes, there is much to read in the potboiler, an adaptation of Karthik Subbaraj’s  Jigarthanda that questioned the traditional constructs of formulaic cinema in 2014. However, director Farhad Samji has imbued the dark-shaded quirky comedy with the soul of a Sajid Khan film, burying the fun in the dust of Bagwa. It means the meta-narrative that drove Karthik’s film has been reduced to puerile slapstick that drags. The humour is so stale that even the combined comic timing of Akshay, Sanjay Mishra, and Pankaj Tripathi could not inject life into this flaccid film. Only Shaharsh Kumar Shukla and Abhimanyu Singh seem comfortable in the skin of their characters; everybody else seems to have put on a show.   In several scenes, one laughs only to not be disrespectful to the talent on display. Arshad has been asked to repeat his side-kick act; the only difference is the gender and age of his partner has changed. Warsi is undoubtedly good at striking comic chemistry, but we have seen this side of his so many times that it no longer provides the kick. Like the comic punches, the action is almost equally laboured. Set in the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh, the film has the cosmetic feel of a Western in terms of the background score, colour palette, and of course, the stylish representation of outlaws. The lazy swagger of Akshay is in place, but after a while, his slo-mo walk seems like an advertisement of a cold drink being played on loop, with somebody whispering from the background, “Look at him.” With the casting of Akshay as the centerpiece, the surprise factor that worked for the original goes missing, as the meat of some of the other characters has been gobbled up by the star. Instead of Myra, it is Paandey who gets a rudimentary backstory. Samji has cast Kriti in the crucial role of the director played by Siddharth in the original. She is competent but fails to push Akshay, something which the story required to breathe.

352,"March 19, 2022",16:58 IST,entertainment,reviews,"‘Eternally Confused And Eager For Love’ review: Refreshingly funny, but lacks emotional heft"," I cannot recall another recent Hindi film or series that shows the flaws of its protagonist as unsparingly as Rahul Nair’s eight-episode miniseries, Eternally Confused And Eager For Love, does. At a football turf, when he spots an attractive girl, he wants to ask her out. But as she comes near him, all he could muster is a feeble “hi.” Ray [Vihaan Samat] is perenially anxious, almost always awkward, unsure of what to say and do, and worse, a virgin and single at 24. A friend, with whom I watched the series, observed, “No wonder he is an Arsenal fan.” (No offence, Arsenal fans.) Ray is also a bit of a loner. He has just two proper friends; one, a schoolmate and the other, a work buddy. So, most of his conversations are with Wiz, a fictional wizard he liked as a boy. He has Wiz as a keychain, car hanging, hand drawing, and a small statue. More importantly, Wiz is also within Ray; he is his inner voice.  Wiz makes the show unique and interesting. His presence underlines the mental issues the series talks about, and adds a layer of manchild-ness to Ray’s personality. Wiz constantly keeps us from pitying Ray, and is unforgiving about the latter’s failures and embarrassments. For instance, when the latter regrets not asking out the attractive girl at the football turf, he replies, “You’re dying alone because you don’t do what you could do.”  Wiz’s constant backchats can take some time to get used to; they can even be borderline annoying. But, as the show progresses, you find yourself getting used to him and even finding it irresistible. The wise-cracking wizard gets some of the best zingers in the series, and is the cooler alter-ego of a loser protagonist. Somewhat like Tyler Durden, but Wiz’s personification does not take a human form; that is what makes the character more interesting.    Jim Sarbh is terrific as Wiz. Despite his absence on screen, the voice acting makes Wiz the most enjoyable character of the series. Some of the lines he gets could have resulted in eye-rolls, but his delivery evokes chuckles and full-blown laughter. Vihaan’s portrayal of an anxiety-riddled, upper-class, twenty-something guy desperately trying to find a woman is convincing too. His acting and Rahul’s writing manages to keep the character from being too pitiable or becoming a caricature.  The supporting characters (except Riya), however, are a bit one-dimensional, especially the roles of Rahul Bose and Suchitra Pillai, who play Ray’s parents. Perhaps they will be explored in the next season, as the last episode ends with an unsatisfying cliffhanger. The ending feels incomplete because the protagonist’s conflict remains unresolved. The other main issue with the show is that we are unable to entirely empathise with Ray even if we can partially relate to him. One of the reasons could be his affluence and privilege, which the show acknowledges; his parents gave him an education in the US, got him a well-paying job, brought him his car… they even help him out with his dating. But for a show about a protagonist with mental health issues, it is keen on making us laugh at him, rather than reveal his psyche. For instance, there is a beautifully vulnerable moment in the show, where a frustrated Ray tells his friend Riya, “I don’t think anyone understands anything. But maybe I’m the only one in the generation willing to admit it.” Maybe if Rahul was not keen on making a complete comedy, we would have gotten a more humane, more complex show.

353,"March 19, 2022",14:23 IST,entertainment,reviews,"‘Deep Water’ movie review: A good-looking, soggy mess"," Does  Deep Water signify the return of the erotic thriller? Adrian Lyne, who has helmed  Deep Water, is quite the master of the genre, having made such succulent lovelies in the ‘80s and 90s as  9½ Weeks (1986),  Fatal Attraction (1987) and  Indecent Proposal (1993).  Deep Water signals Lyne’s return to direction following 2002’s  Unfaithful.  While  Deep Water is pulpy enough with sex and violence and excellent-looking people feverishly coupling or throwing sultry glances and/or punches at each other, there is none of that red heat, genuine chills or smarts you would expect from a Lyne film; he also made the mind-bending  Jacob’s Ladder (1990).  Vic Van Allen (Ben Affleck) has retired after making a sack-full of money of some drone technology. He lives in a small town in Louisiana with his beautiful, temperamental, passionate wife, Melinda (Ana de Armas) and their daughter Trixie (Grace Jenkins).   For someone so rich, living in a lovely house, there is a surprising lack of staff except for the baby sitter, who is called in when the Van Allens are visiting friends. For some weird reason, that is never properly explained (thereby not having us invest in the proceedings), Vic tolerates Melinda’s many infidelities.   In the 1957 novel, the reason for Vic looking the other way at Melinda’s philandering was to avoid the messiness of divorce. It does not make sense in this day and age. Maybe Lyne could have introduced a watertight pre-nup or some other reason why the two had to stay together despite despising each other.   Lyne has chosen the “jealousy as aphrodisiac” route, which is not very convincing either as it does not seem to ignite any sizzle under the Van Allen sheets. The movie opens with a mention of one of Melinda’s lovers, Martin, going missing. Vic jokingly tells Melinda’s present lover, Joel (Brendan C. Miller) that he killed Martin. Joel is scared enough to hoof it.   Next, Melinda sets her roving eye on dishy piano player Charlie (Jacob Elordi) and there is also her first boyfriend, Tony (Finn Wittrock), who crawls out of the woodwork. The Van Allens’ friends do not seem to be real people so much as just there to fill the frames. There is also an author, Don Wilson (Tracy Letts) who suspects Vic, much to his wife’s embarrassment.   The third act is plain silly with Vic tearing off here and there on his mountain bike. Affleck gives a blank look most of the time to signify his moral ambiguity, while de Armas spends most of her time pouting in lovely cocktail dresses and taking off her wicked stilettos. Without sex or smarts,  Deep Water is mainly a good-looking, but soggy mess.   Deep Water is currently streaming on Amazon Prime Video ",Mini Anthikad Chhibber,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/deep-water-movie-review-a-good-looking-soggy-mess/article65239993.ece
354,"March 19, 2022",13:55 IST,entertainment,reviews,"‘Lalitham Sundaram’ movie review: Madhu Wariar’s directorial debut is predictable, yet heartwarming"," Keep it simple and beautiful. Actor Madhu Wariar seems to have followed that to the T in his directorial debut, Lalitham Sundaram, which translates to ‘Simple, Beautiful.’ He maintains the feel-good factor throughout, employing some familiar tropes and situations in the process. However, the movie, an OTT release, is a pleasant-enough watch, thanks to the ensemble cast, picture-perfect frames and some good music.  Prior to the release, there was much talk about a brother (Madhu) directing his sister, Manju Warrier, perhaps a first in Malayalam cinema. There was also a lot of excitement about Manju coming together with Biju Menon after two decades. But those expecting to see them as a couple would be disappointed that they play siblings, Sunny and Annie. They have a younger brother, Jerry (Anu Mohan). The trio come home to be with their widowed father, Das (scenarist Raghunath Paleri) on their mother Mary Das’s (Zarina Wahab) death anniversary. The siblings are more like strangers, busy with their own lives in different cities. Sunny is a failed entrepreneur with a string of flop business ventures to his credit and his married life with Sophy (Ramya Nambeesan) has hit rock bottom. Annie is a successful businesswoman and has a happy family with a supportive stay-at-home husband, Sandeep (Saiju Kurup) and two kids. Jerry, the IT guy, has a live-in girlfriend, Simi (Deepti Sati), who is a divorcee. (It is refreshing to see narratives with stay-at-home dads and live-in relationships in Malayalam cinema.) But all is not well amongst the siblings as some old wounds resurface once they decide to stay back for a week in their huge house. There are some unresolved issues, especially between Sunny and Jerry, which escalate after a point.  However, most of these scenes are quite light-weight, which some might find underwhelming. There are no twists or turns, nor any gripping situations in the screenplay by Pramod Mohan. The narrative has its moments, but one wishes there were more with so many seasoned actors in the cast. The relationship dynamics among the siblings could have been better explored, and the reason for the fall-out between the brothers seems far-fetched.  But the actors somehow hold the film together; Biju, last seen in Aarkkariyam, is intense as Sunny who is burdened by his emotional baggage and Manju is breezy as the high-flying businesswoman in her first direct OTT release. The banter between them, and some spontaneous reactions from the duo is worth watching. But it is Saiju as Manju’s husband who steals the show, and it is a delight to watch him on-screen with his effortless acting.  The locations, especially Vandipperiyar, Kuttikanam and Vagamon have been beautifully captured by cinematographers P Sukumar and Gautham Sankar, despite some of the frames looking too glossy. Even as Bijibal’s music and background score try to blend in with the narrative, one might find his use of a medley of evergreen Malayalam film songs towards the end more enjoyable.   In spite of its flaws, Lalitham Sundaram is worth a watch if you don’t mind the comfort of feel-good dramas. You might learn some lessons and even tear up a bit as well!

355,"March 19, 2022",13:40 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘Salute’ movie review: Dulquer Salmaan scores with his restrained performance as a cop," One of the scenes in Salute has two cops, Aravind Karunakaran (Dulquer Salmaan) and Marar (Alencier), planting evidence to ‘solve’ a murder case. As the action progresses, the suspect is picked up, beaten and drops of his blood placed at the crime scene. It seems too improbable to be happening, but the possibility of it reels one in.  Salute, streaming on Sony Liv, is a slow-burn as far as investigative films go, but well worth the time spent. The denouement is leisurely arrived at, and the few loose ends are tied up and explained neatly. Director Rosshan Andrrews collaborates with scenarists Bobby-Sanjay again for the film, that is produced by Dulquer Salmaan.    The film pivots on the murder of a couple, its investigation, the pressure from politicians on the cops to ‘close’ the case as soon as possible, and what happens in the aftermath. Dulquer Salmaan as sub-inspector Aravind Karunakaran is a riveting watch and impresses as the cop on the tail of an elusive criminal while trying to beat a ‘system’ that places roadblocks. His restrained take as the newly-commissioned policeman reluctantly pulled into a conspiracy by senior cops, including his older brother Ajith Karunakaran (Manoj K Jayan), to frame an innocent man is a diametrical opposite of his flamboyant character in Kurup.  Cops turning on each other is a familiar theme, but the presentation has one torn between wanting to condemn them and empathising with them.  The action unravels after the ‘murderer’ Murali is framed and subsequently arrested. The five policemen, including the Karunakaran brothers, involved in ‘solving’ the case are faced with the fact that the actual killer is out there. Their concern is not the man they framed. The cops are at a point of no return; their lives, careers and pensions are at stake. They have to look out for themselves and each other, even if it means destroying evidence and not letting a colleague do his job. It boils down to self-preservation and a potential whistleblower will not be tolerated.    The ‘system’ — politicians, political parties and ministers — is invoked many times during the course of the film. A guilt-ridden Aravind goes on a long leave unable to tolerate this system, but returns and cracks the case with help from the same system.  The non-linear narrative works well for the straightforward story. The director takes his time with it, and the twist in the tale is unexpected given the build-up. The script ensures that there are no distractions from the main story, and themes such as identity theft figure only to circle back to the case at hand. That said, certain scenes such as the one where Aravind returns home with his girlfriend Dia (Diana Penty) and leaves the family wondering about their relationship seem superfluous.  Manoj K Jayan and Dulquer being cast as brothers is unexpected, but works well. The supporting cast includes veterans such as Indrans, Alencier, Sudheer Karamana, Saikumar in tiny roles, but they deliver what is required, as do the younger lot like Binu Pappu, Vinod Sagar, and Shaheen Siddique. However, one can’t help but wonder about what Diana Penty, Lakshmi Gopalaswamy and Saniya Iyyappan are doing in the film.  There are plenty of opportunities to dramatise and exaggerate, but thankfully, Rosshan Andrrews does not indulge. A police procedure film is always an interesting watch, especially when done realistically, and Salute scores.   Salute is currently streaming on SonyLIV   ",Shilpa Nair Anand,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/salute-movie-review-dulquer-salmaan-scores-with-his-restrained-performance-as-a-cop/article65239848.ece
356,"March 18, 2022",18:06 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘Ambulance’ movie review: Bay’s back with the ultimate adrenaline rush," Watching  Ambulance creates a desperate nostalgia for ‘90s style action movies. And who better than Michael Bay to create that particular hit of adrenaline with eye-stabbing cuts, humour, exquisite cars, thumping base notes and a camera that is as much a character as the actors?   Bay’s lasting outing,  6 Underground, was hampered by the size of the screen (it streamed on Netflix) and always seemed to be threatening to leap out of it. Here on IMAX, the car chases, the dizzying pullbacks from mayhem on the street to a sneaker slowly revolving from the roof (don’t ask) and the emergency surgery to take out a bullet lodged in the spleen of a character inside a moving ambulance during a high-speed chase makes so much sense.   There is a special joy in surrendering to all the impossibilities — the White Queen was surely thinking of Michael Bay’s movies when she told Alice she sometimes believed “as many as six impossible things before breakfast.”   Based on a 2005 Danish film by Laurits Munch-Petersen and Lars Andreas Pedersen,  Ambulance tells the story of William Sharp (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), a decorated Marine who approaches his adoptive brother Danny (Jake Gyllenhaal) for help when his wife, Amy (Moses Ingram) is diagnosed with cancer and the insurance will not cover the experimental surgery.   Danny tells William he cannot help him, but offers him a place on his latest job — stealing 32 million dollars from an LA bank. Do banks even have that kind of money nowadays... besides the point. Danny tells William it is an in-and-out sweet deal that just cannot go wrong — uh oh.   On the other side of town is EMT Cam Thompson (Eiza González), the best in the business who nobody wants to partner with. And there is also a police officer, Zack (Jackson White) who has a crush on the bank teller, and is persuaded to ask her out on a date at the exact same time the heist is in progress.  The heist naturally goes spectacularly wrong with one of the naughty bank robbers getting squashed by the getaway van; that is what happens when you wear Birkenstocks to a bank robbery. The brothers decide to cut and run with their share of the loot and decide to use the ambulance taking Zack to the hospital to beat the police cordon.   All manner of mayhem follows with chases on ground and air. Captain Monroe (Garret Dillahunt) does not even have time to take his lugubrious English Mastiff, Nitro, to the dog park to work off the Mongolian BBQ they had for dinner.   The FBI is called in and Agent Anson (Keir O’Donnell) has special knowledge of Danny as they went to college together. Danny and Will’s dad was a legendary bank robber and also psychotic. He sent Danny to FBI school to learn their methods to fight them from the inside... so inventive, no?    Monroe has the coolest ride and driver in Liutenant Dhazghig (Olivia Stambouliah). Seeing no way out, Danny seeks the help of a wicked cartel type person Papi, and that is a chance to blow up more vehicles.    Just like Veeru said in  Sholay, the film has everything from action and emotion to thrills and humour. Brothers-in-arms, dopey assistants and some of the most inventively-choreographed action sequences in forever,  Ambulance has it all and more. Now if they would only bring back creature features; would it not be fun to see the anaconda gobble up Jon Voight in IMAX 3D?  Ambulance is currently running in theatres",Mini Anthikad Chhibber,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ambulance-movie-review-bays-back-with-the-ultimate-adrenaline-rush/article65237636.ece
357,"March 18, 2022",17:08 IST,entertainment,reviews,"‘Jalsa’ movie review: Vidya Balan, Shefali Shah shine in this tryst with truth"," Since Yash Chopra’s  Waqt, the quirk of fate has played an important role in driving the narratives of Hindi cinema. Screenwriters have often tested protagonists who take pride in their honesty. This week it is the turn of Maya Menon (Vidya Balan), a thoroughbred journalist who is presented as the face of truth by her digital channel. One night, a little indiscretion spirals into an accident that threatens to derail Maya’s career and life. Her life is her little, specially-abled son Ayush (Surya Kasibatla) who spends more time with the house-maid Rukhsana (Shefali Shah) and his grandmother Rukmini (Rohini Hattangadi) than with her busy and supposedly single mother. Ayush’s father Anand (Manav Kaul) is just a lively filler, perhaps somebody who could not keep up pace with Maya. On a fateful night, Maya inadvertently drives into the life of Rukhsana. The rest of the story is about Maya hiding her guilt beneath the layers of confidence, assembled over the years in a profession that increasingly hates self-doubts. When Maya gets caught up in the situation, her senior colleague, a friend and well-wisher Amar (Iqbal Khan) tells her it is real life as if the news that they generate 24X7 is not. On the other side, there is Rukhsana who seeks justice from a system that cajoles her to compromise or else… In a way, Maya and Rukhsana are mirror images as  Jalsa is about people who seem to have risen over barriers of class disparity. But when fate puts them in a spot, the fault lines surface all over again. It is also about people who seek a life of dignity but when life tests them, the vulnerabilities of the poor show up. Director Suresh Triveni, who earlier created the sweet  Tumhari Sullu, has placed conflicts in front of his characters but they don’t cry for attention. They are mere coincidences that can happen to anyone, and hence are all the more relatable and mind-numbing. Thankfully, Triveni doesn’t bring religion and gender into play, and keeps it about how the self-righteous approach crumbles under circumstances; what we casually call ‘stress’ these days. Inside the bigger arch, there is a young intrepid journalist Rohini looking for her first big story and then there is sub-inspector More (Shrikant Yadav) who is on his last case before retirement. How the life of these two intertwine is another compelling little story on how coincidence, sometimes, drives our conscience. Add to it an intense background score and crisp editing, and we have a sleek social thriller that leads to some crude truths. Sometimes, the camera angle conveys a meaning that the dialogue doesn’t. Take the scene where Rukmini, sipping tea at the dining table, tells Rukhsana, sitting on the floor, how they had always considered her family. Here, the camera observes Rukmini from the side of Rukhsana. Be it the craze among the youth to be ‘liked’ on social media or the journalist’s urge to pin down the subject, the film also touches upon multiple facets of today’s society without being judgmental. Triveni conveys many things through visuals and between the lines. Perhaps, there is a spiritual ring to it as well, as Amar tells Maya, the retired judge that she steamrolled during an ‘exclusive’ interview didn’t bode her well! When Maya gets caught in the traffic of a political rally, the hand of the larger-than-life cardboard of a greasy local politician appears to be asking Maya, what she is up to. At the cost of repeating oneself, the depth of Shefali’s eyes and the emotions that they could hold continues to bewitch and baffle. Her Rukhsana is that vulnerable maid from the margins who makes an attempt to hold on to a life of dignity. She is somebody who takes pride in her work and honesty, very much like Maya. Fate tests both Maya and Rukhsana in equal measure, and both the actors grasp the opportunity well. If Shefali brings alive all these seemingly contrasting emotions in flesh and blood, Vidya captures the crumbling confidence of Maya with her body language and shifting gaze, The casting coup is not limited to Vidya and Shefali; the most eye-catching performance is of Surya Kasibatla, as the physically disabled Ayush. Surya, who is reportedly fighting cerebral palsy in real life, is a natural performer with not a single shred of artifice. Not to forget Vidharthi Bandi as Rohini George, the seemingly harmless journalist found in every newsroom who cracks the biggest of black holes. Iqbal’s timbre adds weight and the seasoned Rohini Hattangadi immerses into the household. However, the pace and the pensive mood could not hide some of the gaps. For instance, why does no other channel show interest in a story involving a celebrated journalist? The climax seems like an overstretched bid to redeem faith in humanity. The decision Maya takes towards the end feels a little improbable, and the way Rukhsana returns from the edge feels a bit contrived... but then that’s life, isn’t it?

358,"March 18, 2022",16:30 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘Kuthiraivaal’ movie review: There is very little ‘movie’ in this abstract and trippy experience," In Luis Bunuel’s final film That Obscure Object of Desire (1977), a sophisticated French man falls obsessively in love with a young woman named Conchita. Through these two primary characters, Bunuel explores the sexual politics of the man and the lust he has for the woman. Although it is incorrect of me to say the woman, for That Obscure Object of Desire is one of the earliest and peculiar examples of one character being played by two different actresses, Carole Bouquet and Angela Molina. In the film’s most (in)famous bathroom scene, Bouquet walks in and Molina comes out. This surrealist ploy that Bunuel played around with, could be jarring or fascinating depending on how you see it. It was jarring for me when I first saw it. I bring the example of That Obscure Object of Desire because debutant filmmakers Manoj Leonel Jahson and Shyam Sunder must be a fan of Luis Bunuel, often considered the father of surrealism. Even if they are not fans, they must have at least seen this film. If my memory serves me right, in Kuthiraivaal, there is a character named Babu who dies of suicide. His wife and daughter seem to be played by the same actor, although that is not the only parallel you can draw from Bunuel’s film.  The governing consciousness of Kuthiraivaal is surrealism too. But it is closer to a David Lynchian’s universe than, say, a Bunuel’s. When I say Lynchian, I assume you are thinking of his modern masterpiece, Mulholland Drive. Kuthiraivaal can be argued as Tamil cinema’s first attempt in mimicking the artistic merits of David Lynch — whether in terms of the imagery you see, the manner in which certain scenes (Karthik Muthukumar’s shots are formal and stunning) are conceived to jar the viewers, or in terms of the background score (by Pradeep Kumar. ‘Parandhu Pogindren’ is soulful) that has a trippy, drowsy effect to it. But before we get into the craft side of Kuthiraivaal, let me draw one more parallel to Mulholland Drive. When the film came out, one of the popular interpretations that floated around was, how the first half was entirely built as a figment of imagination played by Naomi Watts’ character. In other words, it was just a dream. Likewise, in Kuthiraivaal, the intention of the first half is to give us the impression that it is just like a dream, a story told in fragments. But unlike a Mulholland Drive, where there is clarity and coherence to the way things are constructed, Kuthiraivaal is purely frustrating and jarring throughout. It gets mildly better and somewhat coherent in the second half. A horse without a tail, a man without an identity.  Kuthiraivaal is about everything. It is about a man’s search for meaning. But it is also about the man’s search inwards and coming to terms with a traumatic childhood episode. It is about the abuse of Nature but it is also about the psychological abuse of society. It is about dreams but also reality; life and lifelessness. It is about sexuality too. A character tells us that a horse is a symbol of sex.  There cannot be one single reading of Kuthiraivaal. But its essence seems to be what a character tells the protagonist Saravanan aka Freud (Kalaiarasan who is really good): “Nenavula tholaichatha kanavula thedittu iruka.” Which essentially means, it is of a man who has lost his grip on reality. Saravanan tries to comprehend his reality in the ‘dreams’ he has. Is he schizophrenic or actually suffering, we never know. That is never explicitly outlined by the filmmakers. But they use him as a narrative device to walk a tightrope between reality and dream. In that sense, the film is a thought train that jumps from one station to another; one plot point to another. There are only theories and questions. The idea appears to illustrate that dreams are an extension of reality and as a narrative experiment, Kuthiravaal is fascinating for sure. But does that translate into a thrilling piece of cinema? No. The main issue with an experiment such as this is that it relies heavily on the lyrical exposition than on the literal. There is a difference between how Thiagarajan Kumararaja handled the elements of surrealism in Super Deluxe than how it is done here. And we tend to distance ourselves from the film after a point, especially in the first half where you wonder if there is a point to it at all. Dialogues are flavourless, scenes hang in the air, as characters hop from one universe to another. The most annoying thing about Kuthiraivaal is the self-obsession that the writer (G Manoj Kumar) and directors seem to have. There are tons of references to Darwin Theory, The Interpretation of Dreams by Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan’s mirror theory, illusion theory among other things. All of these are written into the film only to display the intellectual arrogance of the creators and not to respect the intelligence of the audience. If you’re essentially making a film to impress your literary circle, why should it come at my cost?

359,"March 18, 2022",15:24 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘Stand Up Rahul’ movie review: Let down by bland humour," Stand up comedy in a film is tricky terrain. You cannot pad it up with random comments on politics, cricket or cinema; you have to stay on course with what is suitable for that story and its protagonists. Making the audiences laugh within that framework calls for sharp writing. It is not surprising that the occasional film or two where one of the characters is a stand up comic have not managed to leave an impression.  Debut director Santosh Mohan Veeranki’s Stand Up Rahul, which he has co-written with Anoosha Rao and Prashant Yerramilli, is the journey of Rahul (Raj Tarun) who wants to be a stand up comic. There is the usual tug of war with a family member, in this case with his mother (Indraja), about pursuing a steady job rather than drift like a dreamer. Rahul comes from a broken home — his father (Murali Sharma) has made a national award-winning film but no money. Rahul has to learn the ropes of stand up comedy and also metaphorically stand up for himself. If narrated well, this could have been an engaging urban drama. There is the romance angle, of course. Shreya Rao (Varsha Bollamma) might be the one who can steer Rahul in the right direction but has her demons to fight. The first hour, while introducing us to the different characters, is on shaky turf. Rahul and Shreya cross paths in a situation steeped with insipid toilet humour. Was there no other way of staging this sequence? Rahul’s mother, grandmother and extended relatives are all a certain stereotype. What humanises the father is probably Murali Sharma’s performance.  The scenes that happen in Rahul and Shreya’s workplace, a virtual reality start-up, are further examples of bland comedy. A company named Pineapple and its CEO who calls himself Steve Jack (Vennela Kishore) seems pretty lame. Kishore tries to make the lines given to him sound funny. If only the writing had been better. In an interesting scene, an established stand up comic Hriday (director Venkatesh Maha is impressive in an extended cameo) tells Rahul that wry humour can stem from life experiences, even the most sombre and depressing ones. I wish he had also asserted the importance of a good sense of humour, which is sorely missing in this film.  Raj Tarun puts forth a restrained performance and is adequate. Varsha Bollamma fits the bill of Shreya Rao, a young girl keen to shake off the aftereffects of body shaming she experienced in school and wanting to assert herself and rise above her overbearing father. She is expressive and gets the beats right. But it is the narrative that never finds a consistent rhythm. In a scene almost immediately post intermission, Rahul takes the earlier cue given by Hriday and regales his audiences with a fun account of the frustrating house hunting experiences of bachelors in Hyderabad. This is the first moment of reckoning on stage. The little cheer that this scene brings is dampened soon by the narrative that continues to be wobbly. Neither does the humour work nor is the emotional core dealt with convincingly.  Cinematography by Sreeraj Raveendran, costumes by Archana Rao and the production design all add to the aesthetics but cannot salvage an uninteresting film. Imagine going to an event in anticipation of listening to an established comic but having to make do with a substitute? That sums up the experience of this film, which, despite being developed in consultation with Hriday Ranjan and other stand-up comics in Hyderabad, fails to get it right.",Sangeetha Devi Dundoo,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/stand-up-rahul-movie-review-let-down-by-bland-humour/article65237147.ece
360,"March 17, 2022",18:10 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘The Andy Warhol Diaries’ review: A communal portrait of a lonely artist," The Andy Warhol Diaries, a six episode series, produced by Ryan Murphy and directed by Andrew Rossi attempts to understand the iconic artist’s greatest work – Andy Warhol himself. The documentary is based on a book of the same name, edited by Pat Hackett, which is a transcription of phone calls between the pop artist and Hackett. The book initially started out as a way for Warhol to keep a track of his expenses, and soon turned into a memoir when anecdotes and observations from the artist slipped in.  Rossi’s recreation of Warhol’s voice using an Artificial Intelligence program, that he uses to narrate the diaries, is an extraordinary venture in the world of audio production. Though this might raise eyebrows, one can only assume that the artist, who always wanted to become like a machine, would have appreciated the effort.  Warhol is a man of few words. Though he presented himself in an overwhelming way to the public, very little is known about him as a person. This docu-series is a mission to understand the artist behind the canvas. People close to Warhol – his friends, art historians, critics and celebrities – come together to turn the series into a collection of fascinating anecdotes about his life. The series roughly starts after Warhol was shot at by Valerie Solanos, his acquaintance and the author of the SCUM Manifesto. It delves into the artist’s personal life after the tragic incident; his partners, his attitude towards a segregated racial America, his understanding of AIDS, and his relationship with his sexuality, and how all of these inspired his art very subtly.  Born Andrew Warhola in a Slavic ghetto in Pittsburg, Warhol, as a young gay man in the early twentieth century, was subject to bullying and alienation. In order to cope with bullies at his school and neighbourhood, he started to draw portraits of his bullies and this marked his foray into the world of portraits. The show also touches upon the inspiration Warhol might have gotten as a child. A regular visitor to his neighbourhood church, art historians and critics who feature in the documentary suggest that the imagery of icons in the church heavily inspired his style of art – portraits of icons of his time, from Marilyn Monroe to Jackie Kennedy. The narrative also walks the viewer through the process of Warhol’s portrait-making. From clicking hundreds of polaroids of a subject to instructing his staff about colours and shades, the archival footage featured in the series is a true treasure. It shows how Warhol brought art to the doorstep of the masses by making icons of their everyday objects, a great example of which is arguably his most famous work: Campbell’s Soup Cans. The series then delves into his romantic life, his partners, his relationships with them, and his understanding of his sexuality. Though the primary material of the series is Warhol, never does the viewer feel like the story is being presented only through the artist’s point of view. His friends and friends of his partners either corroborate or dismiss some of Warhol’s claims, bringing the viewer closest to the truth. The show goes on to unravel the relationship Warhol shared with Jean-Michel Basquiat, a Neo-expressionist painter, and in the process, attempts to dissect Warhol’s interpretation and understanding of race in America. Though these relationships did not grab any spotlight, and one on a cursory glance makes nothing of them, the documentary debates on how each of his relationships made their way to the canvas.  The series also gives an insight into Warhol the businessman. The digital medium interested him very much and people close to him wonder out loud what he could have created if the internet was within his reach. There is also light shed on the AIDS epidemic that plagued America and how Warhol was surrounded by death in the last few years of his life. It documents his relationship with catholicism, how his painting of the ‘Last Supper’ came about, and his idea of death, something he said he did not believe in.  As the series concludes, one can fathom wrapping their head around Warhol’s brilliance. His portrayal of the artist as the art, his public persona that is often in conflict with his private life, and Warhol as an event... a phenomenon even. Even if one hasn’t heard of the icon, it is impossible to escape his imprint on contemporary culture. Critics featured in the series note that social media influencers of today walk on the path Warhol walked half a century ago.  Though the six-part, exhaustive series is a sincere and honest effort at trying to understand the artist, the audience comes to realise that we still cannot breach the portraits drawn by Warhol to reach his true self. A close friend of his hopes it remains that way.  The Andy Warhol Diaries is currently streaming on Netflix",Tamma Moksha,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-andy-warhol-diaries-review-a-communal-portrait-of-a-lonely-artist/article65234262.ece
361,"March 16, 2022",16:52 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘Upload’ Season 2 review: A deep-dive into the afterlife," Greg Daniels’  Upload talks of a future when people can upload to a digital afterlife and thus live forever. Uploading would be a fine way to remember loved ones, only there is corporate greed to deal with. And so, in the afterlife too, it is the rich who have all the fun while the poor are banished into 2 gig hell.   Nathan (Robbie Amell) is a computer programmer who has an accident when his self-driving car crashes. As he is dying, his rich girlfriend, Ingrid (Allegra Edwards), suggests he uploads to Lakeview, a swanky digital afterlife.    Season 1 dealt with Nathan’s doubts about his relationship with Ingrid and his growing feelings for his customer service rep or angel, Nora (Andy Allo). There is a mystery about Nathan’s death as some of his memories seem to have been deleted. There seems to have been an argument with his business partner on the future of their company.   Season 2 begins with Ingrid’s unexpected arrival at Lakeview, making the ultimate sacrifice of uploading to be with Nathan. Nora is living off the grid with a revolutionary group called the Ludds (from Luddites?) where she meets hot activist Matteo (Paulo Costanzo). The Ludds want Nora to infiltrate Lakeview to take down the greedy capitalists from the inside. Fun fact: Luddites, originally destroyed machines during the Industrial Revolution.    Season 2 has all the things that made the first season fun; clever writing, and extremely likeable characters and performances. Amell, Edwards and Allo keep up the good work while Kevin Bigley as the permanently-chipper Luke, who was in the army in his former life and Nathan’s buddy, is always welcome in the frame.    Zainab Johnson as Aleesha, Luke’s angel and Nora’s co-worker with her big hair and out-there outfits, has a temp/assistant Tinsley (Mackenzie Cardwell). Aleesha is being wooed with money and promotions to look the other way at all Horizen’s (the company that runs Lakeview) dirty tricks. Her boss, Lucy (Andrea Rosen), has some dirty secrets and surprises as does Ivan (Josh Banday), Nora’s co-worker.    We happily see more of AI Guy (Owen Daniels), the multi-function avatar at Lakeview, including the out-of-work actor, Boris, he is based on. Prototykes, the digital babies offered by Horizen are 100 per cent creepy. There is a trip to New York to find more clues, a harrowing download and a dinner from hell to spice things up.   David Choak (William B. Davis), the super-rich man living down the hall from Nathan who first suggested to him that his death might not have been an accident in season 1, seems to know more about the software Nathan was developing.  Upload is a mystery, a romance, a comedy and social commentary. It might be slightly lacking in depth, but it takes you along on a smooth shiny futuristic ride.    Incidentally, Philip K Dick wrote about a half-life after death in his 1969 cult novel  Ubik set way in the future of 1992!    The second season of Upload is presently streaming on Amazon Prime Video  ",Mini Anthikad Chhibber,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/upload-season-2-review-a-deep-dive-into-the-afterlife/article65230561.ece

It is also the first to be set in Canada. In 2002 Toronto, Meilin (Rosalie Chiang) is a 13-year-old Canadian Chinese teen who hangs out with her friends, Miriam (Ava Morse), Abby (Hyein Park) and Priya (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan). Apart from doing very well at school, Meilin helps her overprotective mum, Ming (Sandra Oh), in the family temple.    Meilin discovers to her horror that she suddenly transforms into a giant red panda. When Meilin hides her panda self from her mum and dad (Orion Lee), they first think it is Meilin’s reaction to her first period. When Ming sees Meilin in her panda avatar after embarrassing her in school, she tells her daughter of the family’s mystical connection to the red panda. The family deity gave all the women in the family the power to transform into pandas to fight battles when they come of age.   There is a ritual that is performed to lock the panda in a talisman. Apart from turning into a giant red panda, Meilin is a regular teenager with crushes and a passion for a boy band called 4Town. When the night of the 4Town concert clashes with the ritual, Meilin has to make a choice.     Turning Red is a perfect coming-of-age film, giving all the confusion and emotion of puberty a fun form in the giant red panda. Mothers and daughters, and friends reconcile, while boy bands croon sweet melodies. The action sequences leading to the big concert/ritual are delightful and the voice cast is spot-on. The colours are bright and bouncy and the message is on the right side of subliminal.    By setting the story in a specific time and space,  Turning Red proves its universality and Shi has not slammed the door shut on a sequel.        Turning Red is presently streaming on Disney+ Hotstar ",Mini Anthikad Chhibber,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/turning-red-movie-review-pixars-delightful-ode-to-female-adolescence/article65226827.ece
363,"March 14, 2022",17:32 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘Drive to Survive’ Season 4 review: The show struggles to survive against the real life on-track drama," The latest season of Formula 1 defied all expectations. One could not have had a better script at their hands. A jaw-dropping championship fight that went down to the wire with a last-lap pass to win it all, the race director getting sacked for his decision at the season finale, a tight fight for the Constructors’ championship.... this season had it all. The Drive to Survive team had a mammoth task of stitching together the 22 races into ten cohesive episodes.  But despite being handed a thrilling script, the series struggles to hold its ground when compared to the real-time drama of the sport. Many of the editorial decisions made in the series are bound to leave fans of Formula 1 bewildered. To begin with, the races that were crucial to the championship, like the Azerbaijan Grand Prix and Sao Paulo Grand Prix, find little to no mention in the series. Especially considering Lewis Hamilton went from taking a twenty-five place grid penalty to winning the race in Brazil and fighting his way back to close the gap in championship points; the stuff myths and legends and made of.  Apart from not giving importance to crucial races and excluding the current world champion’s home race, the series repeatedly showed footage of events of certain races multiple times, such as the championship contenders’ crash in Monza, Verstappen’s crash in Silverstone, and the turn one incident at the Hungarian Grand Prix.  In races it does cover, the show chooses to ignore many key moments. In their episode on the Russian Grand Prix, the makers seem to solely focus on Nikita Mazepin, and ignore Hamilton’s iconic 100th race win and Lando Norris losing the race lead due to a strategic decision. With the show not maintaining any chronological timeline and repeating a lot of footage, it might become a tad confusing for people watching it for the first time. It is also crucial to note that Drive to Survive does not enjoy a good reputation for being factually accurate. Last October, the current world champion, Max Verstappen, who chose to not be a part of the show, in an interview with the Associated Press said, “They faked a few rivalries which they don’t really exist”. The show continues with its history of factual inaccuracies this season when it showed a map of weather conditions at the Belgium Grand Prix... while talking about the weather in Sochi, Russia! The focus from the very beginning of the series was on the championship fight, and rightfully so. But as soon as the title fight became tighter towards the end of the year, the creators of the show start to narrow their focus and in the process lose control of the bigger picture. The focus is solely put on two teams, their drivers and their antics. And in the process, they forget to mention notable driver transfers: Valtteri Bottas and Guanyu Zhou to Alfa Romeo, and Alex Albon to Williams, something they have done in all their previous seasons.  This season also conveniently ignored the retirement of Kimi Raikkonen, a former world champion and the F1 driver with the most race starts. Former world champions like Fernando Alonso, who came back to the grid in 2021 after a two-year sabbatical and Sebastian Vettel who changed teams are also under-represented. Other than some witty foreshadowing in its narration, beautiful high angle shots of the cars on racetracks, and exploring certain teams’ financial conditions (especially Williams), the latest season really does not have much going in its favour. However, if you are looking to get acquainted with the world of Formula 1, don’t let this stop you from watching the show. Despite its punctured narratives and blindspots, Drive to Survive serves as a great introduction to the pinnacle of motorsport.

364,"March 14, 2022",16:23 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘Qubool Hai?’ web series review: Authentic to its milieu," A few years ago, when the digital space was beginning to open up, filmmakers saw it as an opportunity to tell stories without being tied down by box office constraints. Qubool Hai?, the six-episode Telugu-Dakhani series streaming on Aha, is one such example. Sans starry names, Qubool Hai? narrates a dramatised fictional story (by Pranav Pingle Reddy, Sanjiv Chakravarthy and Kevin Ronith Kumar) inspired by real incidents of child marriages and trafficking in Hyderabad’s Old City. Such a premise can lend itself to a compelling narrative. Directed by the trio Pranav, Umair Hasan and Faiz Rai, the series lives up to its potential in some portions but does not come together as a cohesive whole.  There is an authentic, lived-in milieu as Karthik Parmar’s camera leads us into a lower middle-class home that is decked up for a wedding. Beyond the gaiety is the sordid reality of a young girl, in her early teens, being married off to a much older Arab man. Over the years, there have been several news reports of girls being married to elderly men and later trafficked. The series turns its gaze on such instances that continue to happen and appreciably, without voyeurism. The story is set in the Talabkatta area where circle inspector Faizal Khan (AJ Karrthik) is courting the media spotlight for cracking other, comparatively smaller crimes. A newcomer to this police station is Bhanu Prakash (Manoj Muthyam), who eventually wakes up to the marriage broker and trafficking nexus.  At an NGO that counsels girls who have been rescued, two teachers want to get to the root of the issue, though their paths are different. The physical education teacher Shahnaz (Abhilasha Poul) who teaches girls self-defence techniques wants to tackle the issue head-on while Khatija (Vaishali Bisht) believes in the long-term approach of counselling families against giving away their daughters in such marriages.  Things take a turn when 13-year-old Ameena goes missing. Life goes on in Talabkatta. The only one who has the sense of urgency to track the girl before it is too late is Shahnaz. The story tries to find answers to pressing questions: what makes families gullible enough to buy into the lofty promises of marriage brokers? How does this network operate? All this unfolds at a rather unhurried pace, which turns out to be a dampener for the story. Perhaps it was intended to reflect the unhurried lifestyle of Hyderabad and the ‘chalta hai’ attitude, but it does not augur well. On the brighter side, there are some good performances, especially by Abilasha and Feroze. The latter plays Asif, a character from the streets of the Old City, with the authentic Dakhani lingo and diction. Asif has a talent for predicting the outcome of cricket matches and makes tidy sums in betting; he also has a way of speaking and an easy demeanour. When things come to speed, it seems surprising that Asif is indeed naive to not know what he is getting into. The narrative takes a darker turn when a marriage broker Jawed (Suresh Gehra) and a kingpin, Rafeeq (Vinay Varma), are brought into focus. As usual, Varma stays on beat with what is required for his character and puts up a menacing performance that gets further accentuated by the space he inhabits, like the akhada. It is easy to guess from a distance the threat to Asif and his family but when the events unfold, it is chilling. There is also an interesting character called Burqewali, who becomes a symbol of retaliation and liberation. This aspect could have been explored better. We get fleeting lines and pictorial symbols of how the Burqewali is beginning to be revered by girls in the locality, but it is not enough. Towards the end, there is a terrific episode where the Burqewali takes on a mighty force, but then, the camera keeps cutting away to show us what is happening in another space, which is not half as interesting. Jerry Silvester Vincent’s music score heightens the tempo in the final episodes. If only these episodes had also been edited better to build the tension.  The production design by Rohan Singh deserves a mention and the team, as a whole, needs to be appreciated for exploring the nooks and crannies of the Old City well enough. The series ends on a cliffhanger, leaving a few questions unanswered. Had the series been more tightly edited with better pacing, it could have made for a gripping drama rather than something that engages in parts.

365,"March 14, 2022",15:15 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘The Kashmir Files’ movie review: A disturbing take which grips and gripes in turns," Once upon a time, writer-director Vivek Agnihotri told us a  Hate Story; this week, he has etched yet another. Mounted like a revisionist docudrama, that tracks the tragic exodus of Kashmiri Pandits from their homeland in the 1990s,  The Kashmir Files is essentially a battle of narratives, where Agnihotri has determinedly sided with one version of the events. Employing some facts, some half-truths, and plenty of distortions, it propels an alternative view about the Kashmir issue, with the intent to not just provoke... but incite. The Kashmiri Pandits’ pain is real and should be expressed in popular culture, but it deserved a more nuanced, more objective take rather than the ‘us vs them’ worldview that Agnihotri has propagated over 170 minutes.  The film is based on the testimonies of the people scarred for generations by the insurgency in the State, and presents the tragic exodus as a full-scale genocide, akin to the Holocaust, that was deliberately kept away from the rest of India by the media, the ‘intellectual’ lobby and the government of the day because of their vested interests. Agnihotri has improved upon the form he adopted in  The Tashkent Files where he presented his take on former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri’s death through memories and flashbacks, with the narrative going back and forth in time.  Here, Krishna (Darshan Kumar), a Kashmiri Pandit and student of a premier university, modelled on Jawaharlal Nehru University, has been tutored by his ‘liberal’ teacher Radhika Menon (Pallavi Joshi) into believing that the secessionist movement in Kashmir is akin to India’s Freedom Movement. When Krishna’s grandfather Pushkar Nath (Anupam Kher) dies, he returns to Kashmir with his ashes and meets four of his grandfather’s friends who reveal the ‘real’ story of Kashmir to Krishna, and of course, the audience. In their narrative, Kashmir was faced with a clash of civilisations, and the Pandits were left to die by the State and the central government to appease one community. The villain of the piece is Bitta, who seems like a combination of real-life Ghulam Mohammad Dar alias Bitta Karate and Yasin Malik, the faces of terror outfit Jammu & Kashmir Liberation Front. Unlike Vidhu Vinod Chopra’s films on the subject, Agnihotri has no time for romance in the Valley. It is more like a rejoinder to Vishal Bhardwaj’s  Haider, as the film tries to suggest that the Kashmiri Muslims deserved to suffer after what they did to the Pandits and other minorities. A disturbing take, it grips and gripes in turns. The scenes of bloodshed, torture, and otherisation of Pandits have been filmed with brutal intensity. The camerawork captures the dark, brooding shades of the Valley and the performances are compelling.  As the conscience keeper of the film, Kher is at his rhetorical best. Darshan is a revelation and it is good to see the gifted Pallavi back. Mithun Chakraborty, Prakash Belawadi, Puneet Issar, and Atul Shrivastava sound convincing, as friends of Pushkar Nath.  However, the film that accuses the foreign press of milking choreographed unrest and clickbait headlines, gradually falls for the same alleged exploitative methods to reach out to tear ducts and arouse animosity. There is hardly any effort to understand what happens when a majority becomes the minority and vice versa. The voice of the moderate Muslim is conspicuous by its absence. The representation of the educated elite is shallow and towards the end borders on easy character assassination. Some of the dialogues give hope that Agnihotri will address the complexity of the subject that hasn’t been addressed before, but once he starts peddling an agenda against a religion,  The Kashmir Files loses its objective, humanistic gaze.  It does the same selective treatment of the period that it accuses the players in the ‘90s of. Like most in the era of social media, Agnihotri looks at the past from the prism of today and a lot of dinner table discussions make it to the screenplay. There is no middle ground for him, as he picks and chooses instances from the past to suit his narrative. He talks of Sheikh Abdullah, but doesn’t mention the role played by Raja Hari Singh at the time of the accession of Kashmir to India. He also doesn’t talk about how the rigged ballot gave way to a bullet culture in Kashmir in the late 1980s. The film underplays the Pakistan-Afghanistan angle and puts the onus for perpetuating the insurgency on the local Muslim. In Agnihotri’s documentation, terror has a religion and it appears every Muslim in Kashmir has been a separatist and keen to convert Hindus to Islam. How the Dogra Kings ruled the State till 1947 is out of the syllabus here. Of course, religious slogans were raised, and indeed Kashmir Pandits got caught in the crossfire between India and Pakistan, but the history is not as black and white as Agnihotri wants us to believe. The names of Kashmiri legends and their contribution that Krishna invokes in the climactic speech are very much there in history books and oral tradition. If the makers got to know them during the research for the film, it is not fair to tell the audience that they have not been taught about the mystic Lalleshwari, the journey of Shankaracharya to Kashmir, and the intellectual capital of the State. Talking selective use of facts, the film directly attacks Farooq Abdullah and Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, and indirectly holds Congress responsible for the exodus, but conveniently forgets to tell us that it was the National Front government that was in power in January 1990, when the alleged genocide took place, whose survival depended on the outside support of the Bharatiya Janta Party and the Left parties. He has also conveniently forgotten the party, whose agenda he is consciously or inadvertently perpetuating, had formed the government with one of the regional parties which the films describe as nationalist in Delhi, communalist in Srinagar. Curiously, the film talks of justice but doesn’t bring in the role of the judiciary, the legal battle of Pandits, and the fact that the real Bitta spent more than two decades in jail and after being out on bail, is once again behind the bars. In the bid to distort, even the good old poetry of Faiz Ahmed Faiz is not spared. Written in 1979, Hum Dekhenge uses the metaphor of traditional Islamic imagery to subvert and challenge Pakistani General Zia Ul Haq’s fundamentalist interpretation of them. When he says “An-al-Haq” (I am truth), he comes close to the Advaita philosophy of Hinduism. The film subtly derides previous Prime Ministers like Atal Bihari Vajpayee for aiming to win the hearts of people. Perhaps, the makers believe in ruling only the landmass.  One fears, in the name of street justice, the clippings of the film will soon end up in social media to fuel further hate against one community.

366,"March 12, 2022",16:41 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘Pada’ movie review: A sympathetic portrayal of the anger of the oppressed," A majority of responses to injustice often serve the function of pressure releasing valves, as one-off protests calming the pent-up anger, while staying within the accepted confines of civil society. Once in a while, there are acts which break out of this safe zone with the victims of oppression putting even their lives on the line for what they believe is a just reaction. Pada is a cinematic chronicle of one such real-life incident, which is now almost forgotten in Kerala, although the issues raised remain as relevant now, as it was then. On October 4, 1996, four men who claimed to be members of the ‘Ayyankali Pada’ walked into the Palakkad District Collector’s office and held him hostage for 10 hours, keeping the entire state administrative machinery on tenterhooks. They had only one demand: the State Government should withdraw the amendments made to the Kerala Scheduled Tribes (Restriction of Transfer of Land and Restoration of Alienated Land) Act 1975, which was enacted to return to the tribal people all the land taken over from them by settlers after 1960. Over the years, successive governments had watered down the law and the 1996 amendment was the last straw, driving four tribal activists to carry out a daring act to bring the government to the discussion table. In Pada, Kamal K.M. recreates the events of that day to raise the larger question of tribal land alienation. His debut film ID was written around the search for the identity of an unknown labourer who had collapsed at his workplace. Here too, the protagonists are from the marginalised sections, struggling to eke out a living. We get quick, but lasting glimpses of their backgrounds, in the frenzied preparation ahead of the day of action. Balu (Vinayakan) borrows his young daughter’s wristwatch, because timings are important, even as she asks him whether he is going to sell that too. Aravindan (Joju George) delivers a line about his helplessness when a lottery seller pesters him to buy one. Rajesh (Kunchacko Boban) seems to be the only one with a history of violent acts, while Kutty (Dileesh Pothan) is busy pacifying his wife Mini (Unnimaya Prasad), who is in the know of the plan. The script lands straight into the hostage situation without wasting much time for the set up. Inside, it is a relentless shift between various tense situations, giving no respite to the audience. On one hand, there is the constant shift in dynamics between the captors and the Collector (Arjun Radhakrishnan), who is sensitive to their demands, while on the other side there is the Chief Secretary (Prakash Raj) and team racking their brains to calm down the captors. Outside, there is a clueless team of police officers looking for a way in. Kamal is sure of the material he is working with, be it in the political sense or the technical sense. The background research to get right the little details from that day is also evident. The fictional elements or the cinematic liberties that he takes do not take away anything from the core issue that the film raises. But what he achieves with the material has much to do with the seamless coming together of Vishnu Vijay’s music, Shan Mohammed’s editing and Sameer Tahir’s cinematography. One drawback may be the presence of too many actors who do not have a standout role, especially that of Shine Tom Chacko, Karamana Sudheer and Jagadeesh.

A golden retriever named Hawking! And Led Zeppelin! Shawn Levy’s next film after the wildly inventive  Free Guy has all this and more. There are some nice, zippy action sequences, fun lines including “I am the godfather of time travel?” and “We watch too many movies”, teary moments and a jolly cast.  The movie opens in 2050 with hotshot pilot Adam Reed (Ryan Reynolds) stealing a time jet. Even as he makes the jump into a wormhole, he is shot and instead of reaching 2018 where he was he headed for a rescue mission, lands in 2022.   His younger, 12-year-old self (Walker Scobell) is small for his age, a science nerd, asthmatic and bullied for his big mouth. He and his mum, Ellie, (Jennifer Garner) have different ways of coping with the loss of his father, Louis (Mark Ruffalo) who died in an accident a year ago. Adam gets into fights in school, while Ellie is trying to hold it all together and be strong for her son.   Adam comes back from the future to find out what happened to his wife, Laura, (Zoe Saldaña) who vanished after making a leap into November 2018. There seems to be something rotten happening in the time travel business and Maya Sorian (Catherine Keener) seems to be behind it. There are all sorts of horrid people after Adam, including Sorian’s 2iC, Christos (Alex Mallari Jr.).  Adam realises the only way to set things right (2050 under Sorain’s machinations is not a fun place) is to go back to 2018 and stop the science that would make time travel a reality. The cast is all good. Ruffalo is the physics professor whose classes one would not like to miss; he quotes the Romans while telling his class to have fun as “it is later than you thought”. If being a science nerd means one could grow up to become Reynolds, it is totally time to crack E=mc2. Keener with her straight hair and pant suits follows in the long tradition of wicked science ice queens. Garner is also in the long tradition of long-suffering wives and mums of brilliant husbands and sons.   The Adam Project moves along smoothly, with snappy lines, cool soundtrack and the ultimate seduction of turning back the clock. Who would not wish for another chance to be able to spend more time with a loved one, to hold them and tell them that you love them? This is one time turner you could happily do a stint with.  The Adam Project is currently streaming on Netflix ",Mini Anthikad Chhibber,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-adam-project-movie-review-time-turning-feel-good-ride/article65216984.ece
368,"March 11, 2022",23:51 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘Maaran’ movie review: A passive Dhanush tries to keep you invested in an incomplete film," On the surface, you could say that Maaran is a thriller about an investigative journalist facing the heat from a politician for his ‘explosive’ report against him. But the real thrill for us is to investigate the events that came about sanctioning a budget for an incomplete work by a director who once made a cracking debut.  Maaran, by all means, looks like a terrible mish mash of scenes stitched together in a haphazard manner in order to meet the deadline. In that sense, it definitely belongs to editor Prasanna GK, for Karthick Naren and team must have figured out what sort of a film they were making in the first place, only at the edit table. Not to take anything away from the technicians involved and their hard work, but this film should have been scrapped even before it took off. I use the word ‘scrap’ because Maaran’s script has a giant pothole at the centre: the absence of a central idea; the womb of the story or soul — whatever you call it. What hurts is, nobody including Karthick Naren seems to have realised this when they still had a chance. Before they got along to write, I would imagine the discussion room to be something like this: “Okay boys, we have got the dates of Dhanush and Samuthirakani today. Come on, quick, suggest scenes.” Maaran feels like the film that was written on the basis of the artist’s availability on a given day. How else would you justify? Let us take a 10-minute sequence in any film for instance. The rules of the screenplay is, the scene needs to move from Point A to Point B so that it sets up the next sequence. Notice how in Maaran, the scenes don’t segue right from the start. The transition from Point A to Point B doesn’t happen here since the filmmaker doesn’t even have an idea, except to make a movie about an investigative journalist. Why? Because investigative journalists are cool. Does the film at least stay true to that? No. After the first half hour or so, Dhanush as investigative journalist Maaran ceases to exist and Dhanush, the revenge-seeking Anna for his Thangachi, is at the forefront. Should we laugh? Cry? Or do both? The writing is awful. Maaran is the multiple award-winning investigative journalist who has a cover in a national magazine. Guess the name of the organisation he writes for…The News. Guess how he impresses his bosses during the interview...by posting a viral tweet. The makers are that clueless about their own subject material. But, but, there is a “twist”. A Christopher Nolan-level twist. That Maaran is a thangachi sentiment film in the garb of an investigative thriller. We saw this threat earlier in Valimai too. What is this fetish to write overly sentimental scenes for a genre that is anything but family drama? We don’t know. But it is clear that what such filmmakers lack is direction. And Karthick Naren does not even come across as a sentimental filmmaker, at least from what we have seen of his so far! As for the plot, Sathyamoorthy (Ramki) is an investigative journalist. His wife is pregnant with a second child which means in Tamil cinema’s rulebook, she wouldn’t last beyond the 10-minute mark on screen. Sathyamoorthy gets killed right in front of his son Maaran for exposing a corrupt politician. Which means the siblings are on their own. Which also means it is a kick-ass Rajini film template from the ‘80s. Maaran grows up to be what his father was. This is the only portion in the film that feels complete. Notice how Dhanush is introduced in this film. Ask yourself what does it say about the character he plays? Nothing. Notice how Samuthirakani is introduced as a one-dimensional politician-villain. In the said scene, he informs the party leader that he would take care of the journalist who exposed him. Like, seriously? But, but, the best scene has to be the one where we come to know that Maaran and Thara (Malavika Mohanan) are romantically involved from Maaran’s sister (Smruthi Venkat). The rest are a new level of bland.  The promos for Maaran reminded us all that a pen is mightier than the sword. It is high time Karthick Naren puts it to use. Maaran is streaming on Disney+Hotstar.",Srivatsan S,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/maaran-movie-review/article65215720.ece
369,"March 11, 2022",14:54 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘Radhe Shyam’ movie review: Visual aesthetics and little else," At the end of Radhe Shyam, what stayed with me were its picture perfect frames that were painstakingly made to look like paintings. Cinematographer Manoj Paramahamsa, production designer Raveender Reddy and costume designers Thota Vijayabhaskar and Eka Lakhani create the mood for an epic fairytale. But how long can one soak in the atmosphere, admiring the columns of light that pour through tall windows and the long corridors of the hospital and the homes in Italy? Sure, the film boasts of Prabhas and Pooja Hegde who have a good screen presence. But the soul of the film, the story, is flaky. What is meant to be an aching romance of two people racing against destiny turns out to be bland and listless.  In this period drama set in the 1970s, the protagonist Vikramaditya (Prabhas) is positioned as ‘the Einstein of palmistry’. His guru Paramahamsa (Krishnam Raju in the Telugu version; Sathyaraj in other versions) is consulted by a team of Indian space scientists before a mission. The guru understands a scientist’s scepticism of palmistry, astrology and related practices. He cites the example of Arundhati and Vashista stars being known long before they were discovered by modern science; there are things beyond human comprehension, he says, thus setting the tone for events that unfold later. Vikramaditya carries forward the guru’s legacy and early on in the film, reads Indira Gandhi’s palm and predicts that she is going to declare Emergency! Later, there is a passing photographic reference of John Lennon taking Vikramaditya’s autograph. Radhe Shyam might have done away with stunt sequences one would find in a star film, but tries to create a halo around Prabhas’s character through such sketchy sequences.  Scratch beneath this layer of heroism and Vikramaditya comes across as a guy who has surrendered to the diktats of destiny. The way he indulges in casual relationships, which he terms as ‘flirtationships’, is a clue that he is commitment phobic with good reason. Ultimately, of course, he falls in love when he meets the exuberant but mysterious Dr Prerna (Pooja Hegde), who also runs a mile from relationships.  The beautifully mounted ‘Ee Rathale’ (composed by Justin Prabhakaran) serves to show how the two who are destined to not meet or fall in love, continue to cross paths. In portions like this, the film manages to create some magic. Vikramaditya and Prerna’s courtship happens amid hints being dropped about what makes them the way they are. It is also punctuated by banal comic portions in a hospital ward.  The film wastes a bunch of talented actors, making them merely stand by and utter a line or two. Sachin Khedekar at least gets something to do. Jayaram, Jagapathi Babu and Priyadarshi are wasted. The one who is wasted the most is Murali Sharma, and that too saddled with a bad wig. Kunaal Roy Kapur and Bhagyashree also have nothing much to do and were perhaps roped in to have familiar faces for the Hindi audiences.  For the first hour or so, the aesthetic visuals, the music (background score by S S Thaman) and the lead actors who are made to look picture-perfect, accentuate the dreamy setting. Pooja Hegde looks every bit the princess and in later portions, shows a glimpse of her acting potential that is waiting to be tapped. Prabhas is effective in his portrayal, but there isn’t much in the story or characterisation that challenges him as an actor. When the conflict between destiny and love takes centrestage, the film begins to lose whatever little charm it had. The biggest issue with Radhe Shyam is that it never sucks you in. The ship sequence at the fag end of the film sinks an already shaky film, despite Prabhas being made to scale a tall ship in a Baahubalian manner. The parallels with Mani Ratnam’s Geethanjali are also tough to shake off. The journeys of the two lovers against what destiny has in store for them can be viewed as a hat tip to that iconic romance. While Geethanjali also rode on a premise that required suspension of disbelief, it was all heart and made us root for the protagonists. Radhe Shyam could have benefited with some of that soul in its writing.",Sangeetha Devi Dundoo,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/radhe-shyam-movie-review-visual-aesthetics-and-little-else/article65210882.ece
370,"March 11, 2022",13:10 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘Gran Turismo 7’ game review: A love letter to serious motorsports enthusiasts," Even as more and more legacy franchises are trying to appeal to the Fortnite-addled crowd with colourful skins and noisy quest markers, Gran Turismo sticks with its tried-and-tested simulation formula. The latest edition in the series, Gran Turismo 7, can be seen as a love letter to serious motorsports enthusiasts. Barring a few aspects, this game is a near-perfect experience. The makers, Polyphony Digital, take you down memory lane with an introduction to the history of the motoring world. You would feel nostalgic if you have played the previous editions of the franchise. Once you have access to the GT Cafe, you can start racing, earning, and buying cars. More nuggets of motorsports history awaits you when you hit the menu. However, once the game begins, there are no stories, voice overs or cutscenes — it is just you, the wheel, and the tarmac. And, that is all you need. The game reminds you of old school racing before all the open worlds and career modes hit.  The sheer amount of menus you do have to wade through is tedious at times. The GT Cafe regularly serves up races and challenges for you to complete to earn more credits to tune your cars. You can take the race online or compete with offline racers. The simulation gives you the feeling of driving an actual car. The haptic feedback is excellent via the Dual Sense 5’s adaptive triggers. A wide range of car and race selections will excite the casual racers whereas GT faithfuls will love the customisation and simulation options. The rolling start, which puts you far behind in the race, might mar your experience. Do not worry, a quick search will reveal you can switch to grid start from the settings.  Once you start earning the credits, things start getting stingy. Everything costs a lot — paint colours, upgrades and other things. You have to grind a lot to afford anything. Or, you can use real money to buy credits. In a game full of exotic cars to buy and earn, GT7 really makes you work for the collection. Once you unlock the car, however, you are greeted with an elaborate history of the vehicle’s lineage, manufacturer and more. The presentation of the history could have been consistent, as some are cutscenes and others are on text boxes.  Gran Turismo 7 is gorgeous all over. The cars feel very real, making you want to fire up the menus just to admire their beauty. Out on the tracks, things get even more dynamic, as the time of day changes during the race. While some of the tracks are lacklustre, the rest are brilliant — they take you from sunny European villages, to the snazzy high tech Tokyo expressway, and other stunning locations. If you are a serious e-motorsport racer, you will love this game.",Julian Almeida,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/gran-turismo-7-game-review/article65210818.ece
371,"March 10, 2022",13:24 IST,entertainment,reviews,Chennai artists explore philosophical questions through abstraction in this display," Colour characterises Nungambakkam’s Gallery Veda today, as textured canvases that span mediums, genres and thought processes adorn the walls. A geometrical canvas wearing hues of purple, blue, yellow, green and orange, is hard to miss — titled Golden Eye and tactfully positioned at the far end from the entry point, the work by Prabhakaran S., is a jolting deviation from the rest as circles take shape from the flat surface divided in quadrants.  On the side walls hang Venkatesh Balasubramaniam’s series of abstract works characterised by heavy brush strokes and blotches of settled paint; facing which is a frame that holds bright orange, blue and red fibre strips superimposed on a mirror-like surface which Alagarraja Ponniah calls A Movement Suspended in Time.   This diverse showcase is intriguingly titled 5 Art Bananas — ask the curator Venkatesh what it means and a reminder follows: of Maurizio Cattelan’s infamous banana duct-taped to the wall at Art Basel (titled Comedian) that went for $1,20,000, which was later pulled off and eaten by a performance artist.  The artists whose works feature in this display are “our own local bananas”, says Venkatesh. The banana was immediately replaced, highlighting that the intention of the artist is the real art. “For me, this was a defining moment of how the industry is changing. Each of these artists is influencing the world through a social context. This also happens to be the thought behind Genesis.” Genesis is a city-based collective, formed through 1993 to 1998, that put the spotlight on a group of more than 23 like-minded artists, who were also alumni of the Government College of Fine Arts, Egmore. They started with a show at Lalitkala Akademi, and continued until 2008 when the collective shrunk. “The focus was always on South Indian art which deserved more visibility,” says Venkatesh.  5 Art Bananas, which was formally inaugurated by Bose Krishmachari, marks the first time since 2008 that the collective and its remaining members are coming together to show their diverse practices. “It took us three years to pull this off together,” he says. In the meantime, each of the artists has evolved in their individual practices.  Take for instance Ganesh Selavaraj’s works: the artist who dabbled in oils and acrylics on canvas has now settled on paper as a preferred medium. “Through the medium of paper, he is asking whether we can approach a piece of art without preconceived knowledge or notions,” he says. Venkatesh’s work explores the concept of ‘thought’ as the starting point of life — the very element that moves life forward. Prabhakaran’s Inception is reliant on text. In one frame, he writes, “My mother signed my birth certificate; today I am signing her death certificate.” A metaphor to the circle of life, Prabhakaran’s work is an incubatory space where thoughts push and pull at each other, in order to find a balance. Alagaraj’s work holds a mirror up to us, and sometimes quite literally through his use of unusual mediums. And Narayanan’s Totality explores the spiritual journey of human life by eliminating the dimension of conditioning, says Venkatesh. He uses a ball of yarn or thread as a motif that appears time and again.  Genesis hopes to keep this momentum going. “We are planning to show this exhibition in Bengaluru and Hyderabad next, the proposals are being prepared now,” says Venkatesh. The aim is to expand from five to 500 artists in the coming months. “I believe this would bring the Madras Art Movement to the spotlight once again,” he concludes.     5 Art Bananas will be on view till March 23 at Gallery Veda from 11am to 7pm",Gowri S,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/alumni-of-government-college-of-arts-show-abstract-works-in-chennai/article65206860.ece
372,"March 08, 2022",17:07 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘Jhund’ movie review: Beyond the walls of social divide," Providing a level playing field to invisible India, Nagraj Manjule’s  Jhund takes us beyond the ‘wall of social divide’ to a ghetto where life is a struggle for survival. Inspired by the story of a real-life football coach Vijay Barse, who uplifted slum children through football and launched the concept of slum soccer, Nagraj has used his lived Dalit experience to make a sensitive statement on the need to bridge the social faultlines, without applying any sugar coating. It is not as wholesome as his previous success stories,  Fandry and  Sairat, but the social drama deserves to be experienced for its sheer grit and ability to look into the eye of a festering social problem. In fact, the mere act of staring is the real obstacle in the film. When an upper caste boy stares at the Dalit in the latter’s territory, he considers it as an act of questioning his existence; but when the Dalit stares back at the well-endowed in his space, it is taken as an offence for registering his presence. Usually in commercial cinema, Dalit characters are whipped to manipulate emotions in favour of the upper caste or casteless saviour in the name of poetic justice. The proximity between the two is often as much as a politician having food with a Dalit during the election season. The so-called parallel cinema, on the other hand, white-washes Dalits so much that it robs them of the social and psychological warts that have become part of their identity after centuries of otherisation. Here, Manjule keeps it raw and realistic as the camera tracks the anguish in Ankush Mashram’s eyes. But at the same time, it provides a rousing background sound to the Dalit hero, that is often reserved for the upper-class protagonist in the popular Hindi cinema. At one point, Mashram starts sounding like Mishra. The ambiance of  jhopad patti, the residence of ragpickers, has a lot of plastic strewn around, but there is no designer display of poverty. Making smart use of symbolism to capture the trenchant urge for dignity and agency among Dalits, Manjule captures the youth dancing in abandon to the DJ music in front of the photo of B. R. Ambedkar, whose image is hard to find even in the background of a frame of a Hindi film. The sequence ends with the biggest icon of Bollywood bowing to the Dalit icon. At the same time, he places a Dalit shopkeeper who is not too keen to invest in this unreflective display of Dalit power and puts his hand up only when he sees the possibility of a real change. The most effective use of visual metaphor for change comes through in the climax when Ankush passes successfully through a metal detector. The pace is uneven and it appears Manjule doesn’t believe in using scissors. It takes time to get used to the mood, but gradually it occurs to us that the film’s technical grammar is in sync with the lives it is depicting; a meandering urge to get out of the rabbit hole where crime often becomes a compulsion and drugs an escape from reality. For instance, the scenes where the slum dwellers discover that they are Indian and that they need papers to prove their identity are tackled as mundanely as it perhaps happens in life. Casting non-actors helps in generating the atmosphere and a sense of intimacy.  If the story is about a Vijay who is keen to change the world around him, who could be a better choice than Amitabh Bachchan, the original Vijay? Bachchan drops his mannerisms and baritone to play a determined football coach who uses the beautiful game to change the lives of the slum boys. To his credit, he doesn’t look like the odd man out among the cast of non-actors. However the storytelling could have been tighter and a little more subtle, and Vijay’s character could have been a little more layered. His speech in the courtroom takes away some of the impact of all the unsaid that Manjule had captured till then. So does the surrogate advertisement of an airline. But then these are the dangers when you walk on the wall that separates commerce from art.

373,"March 04, 2022",14:43 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘Aadavallu Meeku Johaarlu’ movie review: Where is the humour?," ‘It’s all about the women’ could have easily been the tagline of Aadavallu Meeku Johaarlu. The lead pair played by Sharwanand and Rashmika Mandanna aside, the Telugu film brings together Radhika Sarathkumar, Urvashi and Khushboo along with Jhansi, Satya Krishnan, Rajashri Nair and Kalyani Natarajan. Does the script have enough meat in it to warrant the presence of all these talented women? We shall get to that in a bit. But first, the world of Aadavallu… Chiranjeevi (Sharwanand) grows up in the company of his mom (Radhika) and aunts who dote on him. They smother him with so much affection as a child that he learns to do a tightrope walk to keep all of them happy. He is a nice guy but is ultimately frustrated at not finding a bride who would be approved by all of them.  A premise like that can pave the way for a story with plenty of humour. Those crackling moments are far and between, like a sip of water to parched throats. For most of the film, an inescapable television serial mood hangs in the air. The men of the house break the fourth wall in the beginning and inform us that they will appear now and then and that the women will take centre stage. So we get several scenes featuring the women dressed in their best and doing the things that on-screen happy joint family women do — cutting apples or making pickles.  The seven women who are portrayed as happy homemakers are contrasted by Khushboo as a single mother who helms a small scale industry and her daughter Aadhya (Rashmika Mandanna), a lawyer. We don’t get to see Rashmika as a lawyer, since the story is focussed on her personal life. There’s one scene where a woman seeks her help for a case and another where she stares into her office desktop, just to establish that she is a working woman. Never mind. While we know what troubles Chiranjeevi (there’s a huge poster of Chiranjeevi from Gang Leader to add credence to Sharwanand’s character name) early on, Aadhya is inscrutable in the beginning and with good reason. The narrative takes its time to establish the growing bond between Chiranjeevi and Aadhya, punctuating it with a hilarious scene where she friend zones him in a cafe. In many of these portions, Sharwanand and Rashmika keep us invested in the proceedings. The entry of Aadhya’s mother should have moved the story into top gear. But it fritters away the opportunity by choosing the tried and tested route of Chiru entering Aadhya’s mother’s factory to win her approval. Khushboo’s characterisation of a single mother who does not trust men easily rings much more real than the other seven women who are portrayed in a cliched manner. We get a hint of Urvashi’s emotional vacuum and why she dotes on Chiru. As for the other women who have their daughters, is their love for Chiru primarily because he is the sole male child in the joint family? Other subplots come in as Chiru tries to win the approval of Khushboo. The gag involving Sharwanand and Vennela Kishore in the house of a goon, while trying to help a friend, guarantees laugh-aloud moments. It is fun to watch Vennela Kishore stringing together the names of Malayalam films to form a gibberish sentence, before moving on to ‘Manike mage hithe’ and signing off as Shyam Singha Roy.  The Chiru-Aadhya drama ends only after all the women have spoken their minds. The arguments are well intended — about both Chiru and Aadhya putting their families first and the women, given their own family backgrounds, learning to look at other points of view. But it gets melodramatic and boring. In between, as though to contrast the geniality of the women in Chiru’s household, we get to see Jhansi as a bitter single mother. Though it is easy to understand what makes her the way she is, this is a one-note character that does not get a due closure as the story progresses. The film scores in terms of aesthetic production design and cinematography (Sujith Sarang), but the script needed some life. Devi Sri Prasad also tries to infuse the film with some mirth with his music. If only the film had more humour! There’s a pre-interval scene where Urvashi brings the hall down. To underutilise an actor like her feels like a criminal waste.",Sangeetha Devi Dundoo,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/aadavallu-meeku-johaarlu-movie-review-where-is-the-humour/article65189718.ece
374,"March 04, 2022",14:25 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘Sebastian P.C. 524’ movie review: No emotional connect," We have seen umpteen films on how the physically or mentally challenged lead character surmounts the problem and emerges successful. While the advantage of portraying such roles lies in having the audiences’ sympathy, in a commercial format, the challenge is in making them identify with the character and entertainingly showing heroism. The hero being a good guy doesn’t thrill anymore. In Sebastian, the lead suffers from night blindness which becomes a conflict point.  What piques curiosity is that constable Sebastian — played by Kiran Abbavaram, a rising talent — is on night duty. He and his mother Mary (Rohini) hide his problem from the world. As Sebastian’s father’s last wish was to see his son as a constable, Sebastian cannot afford to lose his job. Pleading with his seniors to be assigned morning shifts in vain, he is transferred constantly. Then the story gets connected to a murder where four characters are involved. The film opens with a woman, Neelima (Komalee), telling her lover that she is getting married. Unable to digest being ditched, the young man plans to kill her. Meanwhile, when Neelima’s husband (Adarsh) is out of town, her father-in-law (Surya) tries to seduce her. Also, a young woman Heli (Nuveksha) wants to kill Neelima because she wants to reunite with her boyfriend who is now Neelima’s husband. Neelima is finally dead but who killed her?  Sebastian is on the job and Mary pushes him to do the unthinkable. What is the reason behind the woman’s death and how does Sebastian come out of a role conflict, to be true to his duty or save his one-time saviour is the story.  The director fails to use the condition of night blindness to his advantage; he neither elicits laughs nor creates melodrama. Had the screenplay been racy, the film would have at least been mediocre. Some scenes where thieves break-in at night and Sebastian is on duty appear cliched. He is shown using the sound to the maximum and beating them to a pulp but that is where his heroism ends. The finale turns philosophical with the dead mother feeling happy that the son who hid his condition from the world has done justice to his job by finding out who the killer is. Barring one or two actors, performances are pathetic.  The beauty of Madanpalle where the story begins is not exploited in any scene. The slow pace of the film is a major drawback. This crime comedy has neither comedy nor a good crime narration and investigation; we end up getting confused. Kiran Ababvaram’s latest concept is good but most of the scenes lack logic, the direction is amateurish and test our patience.",Y.

375,"March 03, 2022",20:20 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘Naradan’ movie review: A stinging critique of voyeuristic journalism," When Sidney Lumet made Network more than four decades back, he used an over-the-top, satirical narrative to point fingers at visual media. It is a testimony to how much media standards have fallen, that some of the over-the-top elements in that movie have become normalised in television studios in latter years.  In Naradan, Aashiq Abu hardly ever employs satire. The script by Unni R. is as direct as it can get, drawing on recent happenings from the political and media landscape in the State as well as outside, to tell the compelling story of the rise of an unethical media anchor. When we first see Chandraprakash (Tovino Thomas), he is already the star anchor of a news channel, but other than hunger to stay ahead of the competition, he is not yet sullied by other vices. But a drop in the ratings, following a breaking story from Pradeep John (Sharafudheen), the anchor of a smaller rival channel, becomes a spark that kindles the ugly side of Chandraprakash. The film follows his transformation to a rich, ruthless channel boss, who hobnobs with shady elements and would go to any extent to maintain his ratings, and to crush even the feeblest of voices that question him.  It is much to Tovino Thomas’s credit that he is ready to take up characters that are not likeable, like he did in Kala. Chandraprakash is even repulsive at many points. His hectoring style of anchoring, cutting off panelists midway and misinterpreting their words to serve his purpose, is reminiscent of many contemporary anchors. It is the transformation in Chandraprakash’s character which becomes one of the high points of the film. This all-round transformation is especially evident in how he puts in place a ‘subordinate’ who used to be his close friend not so long back.  Aashiq Abu uses Naradan to invert the power equations of the newsroom studio, to put on trial the style of journalism promoted by sections of the visual media in recent years. The script points at the inherent voyeurism, the moral judgements and the conservative mindsets of the self-anointed judges in newsrooms. Though many of the scenes are set around tiring news debates and voyeuristic reporting, it makes for engaging drama in the film. Some parts, especially that of a rapper confronting the anchor in a live video, seems to have been drawn from happenings in the national media, just like a part of the anchor’s character.  A good part of the hour leading up to the climax has been structured as a court-room drama, with some solid performances from Indrans, as the judge who is not easily swayed, and from Anna Ben, as a lawyer. Although the arguments justifying media gags in some cases can be misused by some elements, as has happened in recent years, the court arguments also raise valid questions on what constitutes public interest journalism. The two rap songs add to the general idea and spirit of the film. Naradan is a stinging critique of the rot that has taken over at least a section of the visual media, which revolves almost completely around ratings.  Naradan is currently running in theatres",S.R.

376,"March 03, 2022",19:49 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘Hey Sinamika’ movie review: Dulquer Salmaan and Aditi Rao Hydari salvage this messy love triangle," The title of this film, as you probably know already, is borrowed from O Kadhal Kanmani, a Mani Ratnam romance. The Mani Ratnam connection is not just in the title. Brinda, who makes her debut as a filmmaker with Hey Sinamika, has choreographed many songs for Ratnam. The leads of this film Dulquer Salmaan and Aditi Rao Hydari, have played leads in two separate relationship dramas of Ratnam. Also, more importantly, their characters in this film seem like they are from a Mani Ratnam love story.  
Yaazhan (Dulquer) and Mouna (Aditi Rao Hydari) are a young, urban upper-class couple. He is a smart-looking software guy. And, she a paleotempestologist (Remember how some of you googled ‘conservation architect’ after O Kadhal Kanmani? Now, do the same for this.) Their intimacy, conflicts, and dialogues also remind us of Mani Ratnam characters. There is a cutesy scene wherein Yaazhan flirts with an okra as he misses his wife. 
Even their first meeting happens in an unusual setting, like how Adi sees Tara when she tries to jump in front of a speeding train. Here, Yaazhan meets Mouna under a table when a storm hits a seaside rooftop cafe in Kochi . As people hurtle helter-skelter, the two share a shelter, getting to know each other. Within a few moments, they talk about getting together. Amidst a storm, their love blossoms. 
All this sounds romantic on paper. But one wonders if these characters, who are supposedly urban and well-read, would not prefer to get to know each other before getting into a relationship.  
A song, which fast-forwards two years after their first meeting, shows them getting married. Later, we are introduced to the conflict in their relationship. 
We find that Yaazhan is similar to the Prakash Raj character in Santhosh Subramaniam. He likes to make her daily coffee and talk about its ingredients and preparation. He likes to make her an elaborate breakfast everyday and tell her the order in which she must eat the food. He calls her on the way to remind her of switching on the indicator. When they go on a drive, he tells her which AR Rahman song she must listen to. Without realising, Yaazhan smothers Mouna with his love. 
We see Mouna finding Yaazhan insufferable. This incompatibility is treated comically for almost half of the film. For instance, we get a comedy sequence, wherein she is plotting with her colleagues a way to get divorced. And, Yaazhan seems like he is oblivious to his wife’s issues with him.  
The third main character, Malarvizhi (Kajal Agarwal) is introduced towards the end of the first half. Mouna asks Malarvizhi, a relationship counselor, to seduce her husband so she could divorce him for cheating on her. Malarvizhi, however, actually falls in love with him because Yaazhan disproves her belief that all men are “bad”.  
This rom-com about an incongruous couple abruptly turns into a tumultuous love triangle. And, it makes us question the emotional logic of the film and its principal characters, especially Mouna. Though the film establishes that she is possessive of him, we are not clearly told why she never talks about her issues with him. The resolution of this conflict is unsatisfactory as well.  
Despite the sudden shift in tone, Dulquer and Aditi’s performances make us empathise with their characters. Yaazhan reminds us of Dulquer’s smooth-talking character Aravind from Vaayai Moodi Pesavum. Unlike Aravind, however, not everyone is a fan of Yaazhan’s non-stop chatter. Aditi, especially in the second half, is excellent, portraying the chaos, pain, and realisation with Mouna. 
Even the relationship in O Kadhal Kanmani begins with a sense of frivolity and gets serious. The seamlessness with which it happens, however, is lacking in Hey Sinamika. ‘Hey Sinamika’ is currently running in theatres",Praveen Sudevan,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/hey-sinamika-dulquer-salmaan-kajal-agarwal-aditi-rao-hydari/article65187305.ece
377,"March 03, 2022",17:37 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘The Batman’ movie review: Robert Pattinson revels in grim and gritty reboot," It is always raining in Gotham City, and like all good noirs there is a gravelly voice-over talking about cesspools, iniquities and what nots; if you are reminded of Frank Drebin from The Naked Gun movies, that is also okay. It is 10 years since Christopher Nolan’s  The Dark Knight Rises and we are more than ready for further adventures of the caped crusader. Director and writer Matt Reeves chooses to go down the detective route for Batman and so the movie works for fans of superhero films as well as those who enjoy noir. Billionaire philanthropist Bruce Wayne (Robert Pattinson) is only two years into his crime-fighting career as Batman when he comes across an unhinged serial killer, Riddler (Paul Dano), who just might reveal dreadful truths about his past.  The mystery holds up well with layers peeled back to reveal levels of rot. Also, the Riddler’s fascination for word puzzles warms the cockles of every wordler’s heart. Oooh! heart has five letters. The Batman with its definite time frame — Halloween to November 7, an election, and the rich and powerful being killed off in a variety of ugly ways, all of which is live-streamed, justly earns its grim, gritty cred.  Gotham City is rife with corruption starting from the top; Mayor Mitchell (Rupert Penry-Jones), the police commissioner, Pete Savage (Alex Ferns) and district attorney Colson (Peter Sarsgaard). Then there are proper criminals such as mob boss Carmine Falcone (John Turturro) and Penguin (Colin Farrell). There is the nightclub, and then a nightclub within the nightclub, and Selena (Zoë Kravitz), a cat burglar and drug dealer who is looking for vengeance on the side.  Team Batman has only honest police lieutenant Gordon (Jeffrey Wright) and Bruce’s butler, mentor and father figure Alfred (Andy Serkis). The Batman mostly chugs by smoothly through its bottom-busting 176-minute run time. Pattinson makes for a gorgeously-conflicted Bruce/Batman and in the grand tradition of Batman movies obliges by going shirtless for a bit. Reeves took inspiration for Batman from Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain, and it shows in Pattinson’s floppy hair and haunted, haunting look.  Kravitz works as an apt foil for Batman. While the rest of the cast are all good, Farrell knocks it out of the park as Penguin; that is one guy one would like to hang out with. Turturro makes for a smooth, avuncular crime boss. The effects, stunts and Batmobile are suitably eye-popping, while the rain and that final biblical deluge is the mandatory awe-inspiring. It is all hunky and dory. And just in case you had any doubt about possible sequels, at the end of the movie, an unnamed prisoner at the Arkham State Hospital chats up Riddler… Hunka Hunka.  The Batman is currently running in theatres ",Mini Anthikad Chhibber,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/the-batman-movie-review-robert-pattinson-revels-in-grim-and-gritty-reboot/article65186791.ece
378,"March 03, 2022",14:31 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘Bheeshma Parvam’ movie review: Mammootty stars in slick but familiar mafia don story," Building an aura of power and dread around someone is often more about what the person does not do, than what he or she does, despite having all the ability to do it. In Bheeshmaparvam, the protagonist Michael (Mammootty), a local don, does not do much. He fights on his own only twice in the film, which are the few times he even gets outside of his home. Yet at no point do we get a sense that this is someone incapable of hitting back, even at a point when he is physically incapable of doing what he ought to do. Here, director Amal Neerad blends the trademark style he introduced in Big B with the ever-familiar mafia don story, right from Godfather to Nayakan. The opening scene gives one a quick overview of what is to follow. The entire extended family of the rich household has gathered for a celebration. Michael is upstairs listening to the woes of a woman whose son has just been murdered in a case of honour killing. Writ large on the faces of the relatives gathered downstairs are myriad emotions, from respect to envy and displeasure, in what are clues to the kind of equation they all share with Michael.  The script, penned by Amal Neerad and Devadath Shaji, ensures that the all-powerful don is just one of the elements of the film, with most other characters having an identity of their own. Take the case of Peter (Shine Tom Chacko), Michael's nephew, who has failed in all his business ventures and nurses a grudge against Michael. But, he is at the same time a hot-headed film producer, who dictates dance moves to a film star. Alice (Anasuya Bharadwaj), who used to be Michael's girlfriend years back, appears only in a few scenes, yet she manages to convey all that she has gone through in the intervening years. But the characters who walk away with the best of the scenes are Ami Ali (Sreenath Bhasi) and Ajas Ali (Soubin Shahir). All these characters still do not help paper over the fact that much of the basic story lacks any novelty. The simmering discontent within his home, and a man waiting to take revenge for Michael's actions in the past come together to haunt him; but knowing the pattern of such films, we certainly know how it will turn out. Until the last half an hour, Amal builds the film and Michael's character patiently in an unhurried pace that the audience can't be blamed for expecting it all to burst out like a dam towards the end. But this build-up kind of fizzles out towards the end, in what turns out to be a rather tame and hurried climax.  Recreating 1980s nostalgia on screen has ceased to surprise us, but the production design here is worth lauding and justifies the setting during that period. Sushin Shyam’s background score adds quite a lot to the impact in some key sequences. In Bheeshma Parvam, Amal Neerad makes up for the lack of novelty in the story with style and some solid characters.  Bheeshma Parvam is currently running in theatres",S.R.

379,"March 02, 2022",18:20 IST,entertainment,reviews,"‘Euphoria’ Season 2 review: Zendaya’s teen drama is gorgeous, riveting television"," The “constant anxiety” that showrunner Sam Levinson said informed the filmmaking process continues in the second season of the cult drama,  Euphoria. Adapted from the 2012 Israeli series of the same name,  Euphoria tells the story of 17-year-old Rue (Zendaya), her friends, classmates, associates and parents who are struggling with a bunch of issues.  Just like all those teen rom-coms are nowhere close to real life, it is difficult to imagine the bunch of troubled teens of East Highland High being an accurate picture of growing up in the United States; for one thing, young people that age are not so well turned out. Levinson has drawn on his experiences of growing up and his struggles with depression and addiction, and  Euphoria is a lovely-looking and sounding show, and a riveting drama to boot.  Season 1 ended with Jules (Hunter Schafer), leaving Rue on the platform and the two excellent specials looked at that event from Rue’s and Jules’ perspective. In season 2, we follow different stories arcs even as we watch Rue’s horrific descent to rock bottom with her mother, Leslie (Nika King), sister, Gia, (Storm Reid) and sponsor, Ali, (Colman Domingo).  We learn about Rue’s drug dealer friend, Fezco (Angus Cloud) and how his adoptive brother Ash (Javon “Wanna” Walton) got his name. His friendship with Lexi (Maude Apatow), Rue’s best friend and Cassie’s (Sydney Sweeney) younger sister, is one of the sweetest things about the show.  Nate (Jacob Elordi), the jock with anger issues, continues to hurt everyone he comes into contact with, including Maddy (Alexa Demie) who he wants to get back with, Jules, who he catfished, and Cassie who he believes he has feelings for. The beginnings of Nate’s father, Cal’s (Eric Dane), double life is revealed as well as the effect it had on Nate.  Kat (Barbie Ferreira) seems to have successfully fought for body positivity but hates her boyfriend, Ethan (Austin Abrams) for being too normal! Elliot (Dominic Fike) is Rue’s new best friend after the two get high together at a New Year’s Eve party. He, however, comes between Rue and Jules.  The two-part finale with Lexi’s play is a daring choice as the past and present collide to reveal dangerous, disturbing truths, half-truths, lies and misinterpretations. The play serves as a mirror to the many characters and Fez getting ready to go for the play is just so moving.  Zendaya continues to be narrator of the show, in the long tradition of articulate youngsters with a quirky look at love, life, death and drugs. The acting is top-notch and has created characters who might not be very loveable or identifiable, but definitely worth investing time and emotion in. The episode titles again have esoteric origins from Bob Dylan, Henry Miller and Robert Rauschenberg to the French Surrealists, Antonin Artaud and Hunter S. Thompson.  Season 2 ends on a cautiously optimistic note and it has been renewed for the third season. A discussion on Nordic noir many moons ago, prompted a comment that going by the amount of crime fiction that comes out region, one would believe the Scandinavian nations are a cesspool of serial killers, neo Nazis, rapists and human traffickers. That is definitely not the case and nor too could every high school in America be filled with fragile, broken people with major identity issues. However, just like scandi-noir makes for compelling reading, the trials and tribulations of Rue and her friends sure makes for gripping television.

380,"March 02, 2022",15:36 IST,entertainment,reviews,Licorice Pizza," Gary Valentine (Cooper Hoffman) is a 15-year-old child actor who meets and falls in love with Alana (Alana Haim), the 25-year-old photographer’s assistant on his school picture day. It is 1973, San Fernando Valley, Los Angeles, and the possibilities are endless for the enterprising, which Gary has in spades.  He helps his mother in her PR firm, starts a waterbed business, which the petrol crisis puts paid to; then when he hears pinball machines are going to be made legal, he gets ahead of the curve by starting an arcade, all the while determinedly pursuing Alana and convincing her of her final destination as the future Mrs Valentine.  The film, which has three Oscar nominations, (Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay) is a delightful slice-of-life peopled with an enchanting mixture of real-life, inspired by real-life, and imaginary characters.  Director Paul Thomas Anderson ( There Will Be Blood, Phantom Thread), who has also written the film, has been quoted as saying the germ of the idea for  Licorice Pizza came when he was passing by a middle school on picture day and saw a student nagging the photographer’s assistant. The greatest oaks are truly born out of the tiniest acorns.  Anderson’s conversations with his friend, Gary Goetzman, who was a child actor, provided meat for the story. Beautifully acted and shot — that shot of director Rex Blau (Tom Waits) appearing out of wreaths of smoke says all it needs to about the character —  Licorice Pizza is the best kind of comfort food.  The acting is excellent, doing exactly all it has to, for the audience to be invested in the story. Anderson has a close relationship with Alana, having shot many of her pop rock group, Haim’s, music videos. Anderson apparently wrote the role with Alana in mind. Her sisters, Danielle and Este, and parents, Moti and Donna, appear in the film as her family.  Cooper Hoffman, son of Philip Seymour Hoffman, makes an assured debut with a delightfully natural performance. Sean Penn is watchable and spectacular as always, as actor Jack Holden, based on the 50s superstar William Holden. Bradley Cooper is brilliant as film producer Jon Peters, personifying the aggression and bluster of that breed of film folk.  John C. Reilly playing actor Fred Gwynne, Benny Safdie as closeted politician Joel Wachs running for office, John Michael Higgins as Jerry Frick the businessman who does not know Japanese but nevertheless runs the Mikado Hotel, Christine Ebersole as actor Lucy Doolittle (based on Lucille Ball), and Harriet Sansom Harris as Gary’s agent Mary Grady, all breathe life into their roles.  Licorice Pizza is gripping and entertaining, with many takeaways including Alana’s expert backing down a hill of the big, fat truck, the lead pair’s unaffected performances, Penn’s undeniable charisma, an irresistible air of nostalgia and all-round upbeat air. It is just what the doctor ordered in these gloomy, gloopy days.  Licorice Pizza is currently running in theatres ",Mini Anthikad Chhibber,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/licorice-pizza-movie-review-paul-thomas-anderson-serves-us-the-best-kind-of-comfort-food/article65092098.ece
381,"February 26, 2022",18:28 IST,entertainment,reviews,Film Review- Member Rameshan 9am Ward," Starring: Arjun Ashokan, Chemban Vinod Jose, Gayathri Ashok, Indrans Direction: Aby Treesa Paul and Anto Jose Periera Politics has never been present even in the remotest corners of Rameshan's mind, despite his father being an active party worker. Like a majority of youngsters of his age, he divides his time between his day job as a painter, the occasional cricket matches and trips with his friends, and spending time with his girlfriend who stays in the neighbourhood. Yet, he finds himself thrust right into the middle of local politics, when the UKF party nominates him to contest as a ward member. Member Rameshan 9am Ward, the debut directorial of Aby Treesa Paul and Anto Jose Periera, does have the usual elements of the political satires in Malayalam cinema. But, here they do something more. Instead of harping on how all politics is dirty, they focus their attention on the low monthly honorariums that are paid to the panchayat ward members, despite the fact that they are expected to be on the ground round-the-clock, responding to various issues raised by the public. For someone like Rameshan (Arjun Ashokan), who yearns to make a difference to the people, yet also wants to earn the bare minimum to take care of the basic needs of his family, this is a tough ask, especially because he earns less than when he used to be a painter. The low pay, in a way, leads to at least a few of them falling for the lure of corruption. Rameshan is being chosen by party leader Ajithan (Sabumon) as a stand-in to protect his turf and indirectly retain control, as he contests in the district panchayat. The election also leads to the fraying of Rameshan's relationship with his friend and workmate Thomas (Chemban Vinod Jose), who contests for the opposing LKF. Despite having all these interesting elements, the script fails to capitalise on these, hardly ever managing to keep the audience hooked to the narrative. Some drama is sought to be built around his attempt to buy a plot of land along with his girlfriend Annamma (Gayathri Ashok), and around the complications that arise due to its existing owner, but the constant shifts to this thread act only as a distraction from the core story, without adding much to it. The script has just the bare minimum of stuff to ensure that the audience does not completely lose their interest, but that is just enough to take the film close to the average mark. With a less discussed, but important, issue as the basic material, they could have achieved much more.",S.R.

382,"February 25, 2022",18:43 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘Veyil’ movie review: Throwing light on some dark facets," Veyil can be quite a strange title for a film when there is hardly a ray of light in the life of its protagonist. But then, it could also be a reference to the harsh rays that drain the life out of plants, leaving them dry, and the earth parched. That's how life has been for Siddharth (Shane Nigam), who has hardly ever had an extended period of happiness. Out of the few years of his life that the audience gets to follow, there are only a handful of moments when he truly smiles from heart, as he does during the short-lived love affair with Shruthi (Sona Olickal), when they are Plus Two students. The script, written by director Sarath himself, traces back his sorrow, anger and frustration to his home, where he is taken for granted and not treated on par with his elder brother Karthik (Saed Imran), a medical student. Sarath uses the material in multiple ways, to look at the internal friction within the family, especially between Siddharth and his mother (Sreerekha), and his slow descent into criminality. The latter is one of the things that the film gets right. Just like Siddharth, the audience too might find it hard to identify the exact point where he takes the turn to the dark side, although finding the reasons for the same can be easier. It also goes with the nature of the script, which is vague in parts, leaving quite a few things unsaid and labouring needlessly over the things that are somewhat clear.  As the minion in a gang of politically connected thugs, Siddharth at times unleashes horrific behaviour that cannot be justified even by his circumstances. Other than that, it is a role that might have similarities to Shane's previous characters, which have all been in the mould of this disinterested, aimless, and frustrated youth. The script, even while focussing on Siddharth, gives almost equal importance and character to those around, be it his constantly struggling mother, his closest friend Merin (Merin Jose Pottackal), his good-at-heart brother, who is perplexed by Siddharth’s behaviour, not realising it has something to do with him too.  One of the downers for the film is a certain dullness to the proceedings, which cannot be explained away just by the kind of theme it is dealing with. Ironically, some of the darkest events in the film, especially the key event involving Siddharth’s brother and a mentally challenged relative of theirs, appear as the brightest spots, due to their execution.  Veyil has some well-written, well-executed passages, one cannot but wish for some level of trimming and a bit more of coherence.",S.R.

383,"February 25, 2022",15:30 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘Gangubai Kathiawadi’ movie review: Alia Bhatt shines in Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s eloquent take on sex workers," As  Gangubai Kathiawadi opens to the world with the visuals of a little girl stuffed with a mass of cotton into her mouth and a pin being forced through her nose, one wonders how this will film speak. But, after a few fumbles, it goes on to charm with its eloquence. Without being pedantic, it takes a clear stand on how sex workers deserve an equal life, on par with other professionals in society.  Set in a part of Kamathipura that is often called Mumbai’s red-light area, it is about a part-real, part-fictional character called Ganga (Alia Bhatt) who hails from an illustrious background, but is sold into the flesh trade by someone she believed. Unlike Raj Kapoor’s Ganga, she gets really sullied, questions the hypocrisy of society, and eventually rises from the ashes to make a home out of a brothel, and fights for the rights of its inmates. Writer-director Sanjay Leela Bhansali, thankfully, doesn’t paint a breathless hagiography of a woman who rises up the social ladder by hook or crook. Instead, he focuses on Ganga’s interactions with the people that came into her life, the bruises and heartaches that she suffered, and what she becomes by the end. There is a mafia don inspired by Karim Lala (Ajay Devgn) who becomes a brotherly figure to the sex worker. Then there is a tailor (Shantanu Maheshwari) who adresses her desire for a life outside the brothel, and of course, there is a rival in Razia (Vijay Raaz) who threatens to spoil her ambitions. Not to forget her bonds with the inmates of the brothel. It is these bittersweet sections that make us invest in the narrative and keep us engaged. Playing on the margins of his safe terrain, Bhansali, who triples as composer and editor, restrains himself from selling torture, and from rushing into those dark rooms where hopes are mutilated. So much so that in the build-up to the centre of flesh trade, he cuts scenes just before they threaten to enter the exploitative zone. Instead, he chooses to linger around the bed of black roses, as Gangu describes her ilk, and translates that smell to us. It is strong, pungent, redolent in turns, and ultimately leaves you with something ethereal. Take the scene where the inmates dress up the dead body of a sex worker who has died after giving birth to a child; it is as raw as it could get, but in Bhansali’s hands, even death looks elegant and evokes multiple emotions. This is easily the director at his best as he has been able to marry craft with content. For a long time, he has been trying to create a modern-day  Mughal-e-Azam; here, he attempts a  Pakeezah for the millennials and almost succeeds. Devoted to the visual grammar of cinema, Bhansali carefully peels off the element of lust through lilting melodies that are enough to convey the convoluted layers of the human heart beneath the linear tale. In fact, two songs, Meri Jaan and Jab Saiyaan, form the crux of the narrative.  In Alia, he has a muse who can depict multiple emotions in one frame, through words, silences, and expressions. Be it the body language or dialogues, she minimises the element of acting in her performance. Watch her perform in Meri Jaan as she crystallises the complex that Ganga holds inside her in one song; she makes you cry, laugh, and feel guilty simultaneously. The way Alia gradually transforms from Ganga to Gangubai, laughs in pain, and gently hectors a child at the sight of impending conflict makes even the predictable compelling. The dialogues by Prakash Kapadia and Utkarishini Vashisht remain conversational even when Gangu threatens to be in the lecture. The casual presence of Dev Anand is more than just symbolic. The support cast responds strongly to Alia, particularly Vijay Raaz in a short but memorable performance. As the eunuch sex worker, he sends chills down the spine and leaves you craving for more. Shantanu brings his dance training to help the elegant romance come alive. Meanwhile, Devgn is supposed to bring the star value and that he does that with ease. Sudeep Chatterjee’s cinematography reminds us of the Kamal Amrohi film as the camera permeates through prurient surfaces to align with the soul of the residents. Together with Bhansali, he carves a visual treat. In the entry shot of Razia, with the larger-than-life film posters in the background and a feature film playing in the middle of a street, Chatterjee rustles up dollops of nostalgia and awe. But at the same time, he generates a gentle urge to make us walk in the forbidden lanes of Kamathipura. The pragmatic could still question the dependence of the heroine on a don and the absence of a potent climax, but this one is for the romance of a petite underdog with a tenacious character, someone who bites with her golden smile.

384,"February 25, 2022",15:12 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘Bheemla Nayak’ movie review: This starry outing is packed with fun moments," If Ayyappanum Koshiyum (2020) was considered mainstream masala in Malayalam cinema, in hindsight, it appears like an arthouse project in comparison to its Telugu adaptation Bheemla Nayak. Director Saagar K Chandra, aided by Trivikram Srinivas who steers the screenplay and dialogues, dishes out a racy, crisp adaptation that amps up the beats to cater to the fanbase of Pawan Kalyan (Bheemla Nayak), while ensuring that his battle with the ego-driven Daniel Shekhar (Rana Daggubati) is not one-sided. The battleground is the forest region connecting Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. In the opening minutes, Bheemla Nayak pays his obeisance to the forest, while Daniel quips that he’s the tiger who is resting after a few drinks. Ravi K Chandran’s camera and the catchy folk number composed by S S Thaman lead us through the terrain.  Daniel Shekhar does not think it is a crime to have a stash of alcohol as his car zips through the forest zone, while the cops will have none of it. The clash between the cops and Shekhar swiftly snowballs into something bigger, both trying to have an edge over the other. Bheemla tries to keep things in check, in vain. The dialogues oscillate between a few politically charged statements to the filmy. Bheemla Nayak is a sub inspector and a demigod for the locals. His reputation of coming down hard on criminals while being considerate to hapless souls who err out of desperation precedes him. Then there’s his backstory that the villagers know but will not discuss and consider it a ‘sacred oath’, which comes into play later.  Daniel Shekhar is an aspiring politician, backed by his family’s wealth and power. He fancies himself as a hero, paving way for pop culture references to Pawan Kalyan’s Gabbar Singh and the iconic character from Sholay. Trying to broker some peace between them is circle inspector Kodandaram (Murali Sharma). The first hour shows a somewhat restrained Bheemla Nayak, like Ayyappan in the original. The difference, however, lies in the atmospherics. The title song, choreographed with ample slow movements and hundreds of junior artists dressed in multi-hued apparel, is enough indication to Daniel Shekhar that Bheemla Nayak is no ordinary S.I. In this adrenaline-laden battle, the women get some room to make themselves heard. It is fun to watch Nithya Menen as firebrand Suguna, though her character is paler than her counterpart in the original, stripped of the communist leanings. Thankfully, there is enough spunk and Nithya makes it worthwhile when she eggs Bheemla Nayak to not let go of any wrong-doer easily. Samyuktha Menon as Daniel Shekhar’s wife gets a character that is a tad more assertive than in the Malayalam film.  The battle heightens once Bheemla Nayak is stripped of his official duties. His backstory, though an overused and stale template in Telugu films, is salvaged to an extent when used for a turning point eventually.  The end is a bit tame after a fierce face-off over two hours. Nuances of class divisions are downplayed and Bheemla is mostly whitewashed, rather than coming across as a multi-layered and flawed personality. But perhaps that is asking for too much. Pawan Kalyan does not have it easy in the battle and that itself is a win. Bheemla is also his most restrained performance in recent times.  The one who appears to have had a blast is Rana Daggubati, leveraging his towering personality and physique to good effect and owning that devil-may-care attitude. Samuthirakani and Rao Ramesh are saddled with one-note characterisations. Raghu Babu, Teja Kakamanu and Narra Srinu are effective in their brief parts. Thaman’s score is enjoyable and adds to the intensity of the drama. Bheemla Nayak is Ayyappanum Koshiyum on steroids, serving its purpose of a theatrical outing amid cheers. The cheers got deafeningly loud when Brahmanandam arrived on screen, drowning out the next few lines delivered by both Rana and Pawan Kalyan.

385,"February 24, 2022",14:34 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘Valimai’ movie review: The ‘Amma’ sentiment ruins this otherwise thrilling Ajith Kumar-starrer," Remember when Tom Hardy decides to join a small group of all-women rebels against the army of war boys in gorgeous set pieces and action sequences of Mad Max: Fury Road? Now, imagine Tom Hardy walking up to Charlize Theron, narrating why he chose to join them with a sentimental backstory: that of the promise he made to his mother long before she passed away. Imagine how boring, how fake that movie would have turned out to be. This is exactly the problem that kills the H. Vinoth-directed Valimai from becoming a daring action film. But this is not a needless exaggeration to satisfy Ajith Kumar’s fans: Valimai’s stunt scenes are stunning. Absolutely stunning. H. Vinoth is truly a remarkable talent. He is one of the rare filmmakers who understands and thinks through the action blocks before writing them down. While Theeran Adhigaram Ondru announced that H. Vinoth could do action, Valimai reaffirms our belief that H. Vinoth could perhaps be the best Indian filmmaker who knows how to write, choreograph and execute action sequences with a larger vision and purpose. Valimai could have been that racy, out-and-out action film we have seen in a long time. But it is bogged down by narrative hiccups: a) it ruins the overall experience with atrociously-written sentimental scenes and b) sadly, it is yet another Ajith Kumar-starrer where the style supersedes the substance.  Ajith Kumar is a rare ‘superstar’ who doesn’t seem to care too much about his ‘image’ and what the gatekeepers of Kodambakkam demand from him. It could be argued that he is, perhaps, the first star to break the on-screen image of a ‘hero’ with Mankatha, wherein he played a ruthless villain with flamboyance and without a moral compass. Which is why Valimai hurts more, for, it looks like a missed opportunity to exploit Ajith Kumar for a pure genre film. But more about the ‘Ajith’ problem later. Valimai has a very generic premise; it employs a decades-old Good vs Evil trope. But where we get to actually see the flourishes of Vinoth is in the manner he does that. Kartikeya Gummakonda plays a Satan-like Wolfranga who exploits vulnerable youngsters, shunned by society as ‘failures’. He uses them to smuggle drugs that have already been smuggled into Tamil Nadu. In other words, they are Satan’s horses. And the person who has to stop them has to be a demi-god, right? In order to introduce this demi-god, Vinoth takes us to Madurai during the Alagar festivities. We get snapshots of the festival, but the actual Alagar comes alive through Ajith in the midst of thunder and lightning. The set-up and staging are so gorgeous that it leaves you wanting more. That is another thing about Valimai. Every time we get a stunning action scene, it gives us this feeling that there is more to come. Which is why, even at 180-minutes long, Valimai feels like a great set-up for something big. And you feel cheated when it ends, rather dully. If you are a fan of action, Valimai has three terrific stretches written into the proceedings. Even if these scenes play to Ajith Kumar’s strengths and reputation as a biker-racer, they are filmed in a manner where you could see the director’s vision to not settle for the ordinary. Valimai is also that film where the director, cinematographer (a fantastic Nirav Shah), stunt choreographer (props to stunt director Dhilip Subbarayan for those mouthwatering bike stunts), background score (Ghibran’s contribution is a huge booster, although the score is loud and overbearing at times) and editor (Vijay Velukutty) are in sync with one other.  The pre-interval stretch, which has people hanging in the air, crawling on the ground and showing off 360 degree skills, makes you wonder how good Vinoth is. Rather, how good Vinoth can be, if he were to make a pure action film. In case you hadn’t noticed, almost three-fourth of this review is about stunts. Because, Valimai looks like the film it could have been.  H. Vinoth also comes across as a filmmaker who understands moral complexities and the compromises that we, as a society, give ourselves. There is a great line Ajith says about women and gold chains. There is an even better line that Kartikeya says about the oppression parents put on their kids. There is even an attempt to understand how youngsters are radicalised. But where Vinoth struggles is when he writes the second half. The idea seemed to be about two people losing the power they think they had. But that doesn’t translate on screen. That is also where Valimai ends up looking without a flavour. That said, without the ‘amma’ sentiment, we would not have got a Mahabaratha kind of a moment between two brothers, one of whom is Arjun (Ajith Kumar).  It has often been said about Superstar Rajinikanth, that filmmakers seem to struggle with him, not knowing how to handle the stardom that supersedes his talent as a gifted actor. This argument could be made more so for Ajith Kumar who is easily an enigma and whose star power continues to be a mystery. Only three filmmakers seemed to have excelled in handling Ajith: Vishnuvardhan in Billa and Aarambam, Venkat Prabhu in Mankatha and Gautham Menon in Yennai Arindhal; the latter is easily the best Ajith Kumar-starrer in the last decade. None of this is to say that Valimai is a terrible watch by any stretch. It is one of the better Ajith films in recent times. But it is also something we have grown tired of watching Ajith do. Again and again.  Ajith Kumar himself looks so tired on the screen; though give him a pair of sunglasses and he transforms into being the most charming star again. But, but, there is something about Kumar’s eyes that looks defeated, as if they are screaming that the man is worn out and needs rest. As the hunt for a satisfying Ajith Kumar show continues, one wishes that AK gets a goodnight sleep first. Valimai is currently running in theatres.",Srivatsan S,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/valimai-movie-review-the-amma-sentiment-ruins-this-otherwise-thrilling-ajith-kumar-starrer/article65080099.ece
386,"February 22, 2022",17:49 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘#Homecoming’ movie review: Soumyajit Majumdar’s reunion flick suffers from its own ignorance of the past," A personal ode to theatre, Soumyajit Majumdar’s directorial debut, #Homecoming, attempts at invoking an emotional response to the art form’s decline in popular culture.  Members of a youth theatre group, ‘Amra’, reunite seven years after graduating from college, at a house party being held at their old rehearsal space. The looming realisation that this space will soon to be turned into a heritage hotel becomes the focal point of all conversations as characters ruminate on the time spent there.  As friends trickle into the party, we learn where these characters ended up after their theatre group dissolved. Some like Sri (Sayani Gupta) followed a similar path into film acting, while others like Abhishek aka ‘Godot’ turned to the corporate life. Majumdar’s frames this party as a space for these (now grown-up) characters to think about an alternate direction the theatre group could have taken. A good reunion film stands on the foundational knowledge of the strong relationship the characters used to share. In the absence of that it has to rely on the chemistry between actors. However, #Homecoming lacks both.  Majumdar tries to steer several short films together, as we see distinct conversations run parallelly between different friend groups at the party, but he struggles to bind these together with a cohesive thread.  Theatre is supposed to be the strand that ties these individuals, but since we get only glimpses of their time as ‘Amra’, it becomes hard to care for the fizzled-out friendships, broken relationships, and failed careers. The youth theatre group is only ever shown in quick short flashbacks, almost always without dialogues.  Sadly, like the fleeting flashbacks, the present-day interactions between these reunited friends play out on a surface level. The film hardly touches base with how these friendships were formed, or what has left them so frayed now.  Communication that is supposed to provide context for the characters’ emotions, barely registers an impact, as we either get exposition dump or overtly high-brow one liners. As the party progresses, we are made aware that Shubho (Tushar Pandey) is missing from the party and has been ignoring attempts his friends have made to get in touch with him. Later when he finally arrives at the party, we get a two-minute-long scene of him going on an impassioned speech about the decline of “good theatre.” Shubho, the theatre purist who ventured into acting but now finds himself lost and cynical, could have been used as a window for the audience to personify the struggles of a dying art form.  Instead, Shubho spends his time talking about the takeover of artificial Intelligence, that will decimate creativity. He then turns his focus to the audience, the middle class who he chastises for “celebrating regressive gimmicks and mediocrity.” This sermonising, which irritates his on-screen friends, does not move the audience given that we still don’t know the positive impact of theatre in his life.  However, while the writing may leave much to be desired, the visuals come through as a saving grace. For a film that mostly takes place in one location, cinematographer Anup Singh’s work doesn’t leave you bored while wandering around this house party.  For a film that spends so much time on expressing sadness over what the friends lost as they drifted apart, and what the culture is losing as theatre loses steam, it never actually shows us the value of what they possessed.  The film tries to achieve a lot, but like its characters, fails to fulfil its artistic ambitions.  #Homecoming is currently streaming on SonyLIV",Pallavi Keswani,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/soumyajit-majumdars-homecoming-suffers-from-its-own-ignorance-of-the-past/article65074004.ece
387,"February 19, 2022",16:25 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘Love and Leashes’ movie review: When public relations go private," If you haven’t watched Love and Leashes on Netflix yet, now may be the time to give it a go. The Korean movie – directed by Park Hyun-jin, is an adaptation of the webcomic Moral Sense by Gyeowool. Spoiler alert: it isn’t a raunchy romantic movie filled with crazy love-making scenes. The movie revolves around a man’s secret fetish for BDSM (bondage and discipline, domination and submission, sadism and masochism). Jung Ji-woo (Seohyun) and Jung Ji-hoo (Lee Jun-Young) are colleagues at a public relations firm. Ji-woo develops feelings for her co-worker, but does not express her feelings until things take an unexpected turn, when – due to their similar names – she receives a package intended for Ji-hoo. As the package has a dog leash, Ji-hoo explains to her about his S&M (submission and masochism) inklings and that he likes playing a submissive role. Surprised that Ji-woo does not pass any judgment about his fetish, Ji-hoo is surprised he asks if she would become his dominant or ‘master’, but without the involvement of sex. She should, instead order him around during their role-play. The two agree on a three-month relationship, by contract. Ji-woo and Ji-hoo show great on-screen coordination when it comes to expressing and following through on not just their desires, but also their curiosities.   Though Love and Leashes aims to be a romantic comedy, it lacks light moments and fails to induce any laugh-out-loud comedy. However, like other K-dramas, it admirably discusses choice, the right to make a choice, as well as consent and preference.  For example, there is a scene where a frustrated Ji-Woo cries as he recalls how his ex-girlfriend could not understand his preferences and broke up with him, and wonders if he should have discussed it with her.  In another scene, Ji-woo’s friend, Hye-mi (Lee El), who is also into BDSM, goes out on a blind date with a man who construes BDSM as consent for sexual abuse. After being rescued by Ji-Woo and Ji-hoo, she tells her date, “Just because I am a pervert, you have no right to mistreat me.” She adds that she did not take a picture of the guy to expose him, even though he mistreated her; Hye-mi doesn’t want to tarnish his image as going out with him was her choice. In the age of titles such as Sex/Life, Bridgerton and  Love Stories, Love and Leashes certainly forays into adult territory, but without much raunchiness, except for the role-playing props, attires and a couple of S&M scenes. However, it is notable for some mature conversations through the characters’ interactions and self-exploration.  Love and Leashes is currently streaming on Netflix",Prabalika M Borah,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/love-and-leashes-movie-review-2022-netflix/article65065110.ece
388,"February 18, 2022",17:31 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘Aaraattu’ movie review: All-round star worship... and then some," Counting the number of references that are made in ‘Aaraattu’ to Mohanlal’s previous films can be an engaging activity to indulge in while sitting through the almost three hours of all-round star worship. For the script is replete with those, with a few landing well and a majority falling flat. In some sequences, like when Neyyatinkara Gopan (Mohanlal) visits an old ‘tharavadu’, the references come so thick and fast, that it is hard to keep up.  The worst of it comes in a scene involving Indrans, playing a paralysed man, with Gopan breaking into the song ‘Thamarappoovvil Vaazhum’ from ‘Chandralekha’, in a reference that spoils the memory of the original with its absurd attempt at comedy. Director B.Unnikrishnan is unapologetic in what he has set out to do, which is a good thing, for we do need commercial mass entertainers. Yet the same spirit does not translate into creating something that is original.  ‘Aaraattu’ also chooses the easy route chosen by some recent superstar films in drawing on the star’s earlier films, and using their nostalgic value to satisfy the die-hard fans. Screenwriter Udaykrishna’s trick here is to portray some of these references to Lal’s films as spoofs, even while raining upon us cliche after cliche throughout the entire film. He wants to appear to be making fun of these superstar cliches, even while using the same things to further the unimaginative plot. At the centre of the plot is Edathala Mathai (Vijayaraghavan) who lords over Muthalakotta village, and wants to prevent the Government from taking control of his large swathes of land for cultivation. Through wheeler-dealers, he comes into contact with Neyyatinkara Gopan, to whom he leases the land, in an attempt to fill it up and prevent cultivation. But Gopan seems to have other intentions.  The thin plot line appears to be an excuse for a celebration of the star from every angle possible. An extended tiff with Anjali (Shraddha Srinath), an upright RDO, and a gang of four youngsters, who resist his moves, are also weaved in, but none of these characters have any kind of depth to them. The scriptwriter even forgets some of them, as towards the end, he is concentrating on delivering some ‘twists’ and a done-to-death background story, which only manage to take the film further down. Even for the most ardent admirer of A.R.Rahman’s music, the musician’s cameo appearance and concert performance, would come as a disappointment, thanks to the way it is portrayed.  ‘Aarattu’ has quite a number of scenes where the entire village crowds around Gopan in admiration. The scriptwriter and the director seem to expect of the audience such a level of wide-eyed admiration of the star, for there is nothing else for the film to bank on. The obsession to recapture the spirit of the old Mohanlal films is also quite evident here, but such unoriginal mashups are a disservice to the actor, who still can be used in much better ways in the commercial mass entertainer format itself.

389,"February 18, 2022",16:21 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘Uncharted’ movie review: Plastic video game affair," It is soulless, stuffed with pointless CGI and criminally derivative. While all this is true of  Uncharted, based on the stupendously-popular game, on the plus side is a delightful performance by Tom Holland as Nate Drake, glittering locations including Alicante, Valencia, Xàbia and Barcelona, secret messages written in invisible ink and postcards.  There is something so romantic about postcards; it is almost up there with that animal-hide covered old explorer’s notebook full of post its and whatnots, and dark, medieval maps with squiggly lines and involved pictures of monsters lurking in the deep.  Nate and brother Sam, ancestors of the original Indiana Jones, Sir Francis Drake, dream of getting their hands on Magellan’s great treasure — the theory is he did not circumnavigate the globe for fun but for gold. His trip was financed by the rich and powerful Moncada family. Magellan died before completing his journey. His captain and 17 crew members found the treasure and completed the circumnavigation.  Sam leaves 10-year-old Nate behind with a promise to return for him. 15 years later, Nate is a bartender doing small time hustles when he is approached by veteran treasure hunter Sully (Mark Wahlberg), who claims to have worked with Sam, and needs Nate’s help to get Magellan’s treasure. There is an auction, (and a chance for everyone to dress up), a scary mercenary called Braddock (Tati Gabrielle) with a henchman who speaks in a super-thick Scottish accent, and the last of Moncada clan (Antonio Banderas) doing various sorts of evil.  The treasure hunters repair to Spain to find a church and a vault, with a pair of golden crosses which are actually keys, and a map where X might mark the spot. Nate and Sully catch up with Chloe (Sophia Ali) in Spain and they solve 500-year-old mysteries on the run like all good tomb raiders in popular culture.  Some of the stunts are suitably jaw-dropping, including the opening sequence where there is much fighting as people, crates and a lovely car fall out of a plane and the mid-air ramming of 500-year-old ships. CGI, however, has rendered all stunts bland. The sky was never the limit for imagination, so wonder why CGI renders everything plastic.  There is the mandatory mid and end-credit sequence indicating sequels where Nate and Sully might run into the crew from Red Notice. While one would have expected more creativity from director Ruben Fleischer, who helmed the delightful  Zombieland,  Uncharted is a tolerable way to spend time at the movies.  Uncharted is currently running in theatres ",Mini Anthikad Chhibber,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/uncharted-movie-review-plastic-video-game-affair/article65062111.ece
390,"February 18, 2022",14:17 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘Son of India’ movie review: Indulgent experiment goes awry," Son of India’s duration is 1 hour 42 minutes, and that is the film’s only saving grace. The story harks back to the many revenge and vigilante dramas that have emerged in the years following director Shankar’s Bharateeyudu (Indian) and Aparichitudu (Anniyan). The story is narrated in a format that the film team thinks is experimental, but is amateurish. As the opening credits roll, veteran actor Mohan Babu who headlines the film explains that the experimental narrative is built on the idea that he had once explored in stage plays, when his mono-act served to narrate the story and connect with the audience. He informs that in Son of India, viewers will mostly get to see him and a few actors who play television anchors, while the identities of the rest of the cast will be revealed towards the end. Thereafter, a voiceover introduces Mohan Babu’s character (let’s not name him yet) as something of an enigma. The opening song places the actor amid a collection of stock footage and sub-par visual effects. Mohan Babu sets off on a mission after a cryptic message that follows a devotional song.  Soon, a central minister (Srikanth) is kidnapped and the National Investigation Agency gets to work. Since we’ve been told that for the most part, we will not see the other actors, we get a whole lot of top angle shots, point of view shots from random objects and plenty of blurred visuals. We identify the actors playing the officers through their ID cards, and sometimes voices. Prudhvi Raj perpetually sports PPE kits, Mangli breaks into a folksy song amid investigation and Pragya Jaiswal as officer Airawathy has to make do with sub-par dubbing. The film doesn’t trust the intelligence of its viewers to grasp what is unfolding on screen. The voiceover delineates every action soon after an event unfolds, even when the characters have themselves explained things. It goes, ‘Oh, you thought he was an NIA officer, then you assumed he was a temporary driver, and now you are wondering if he is a kidnapper. What must be his motive?’. You get the drift… The sliver of the plot revealing Virupaksha (Mohan Babu)’s backstory happens post-intermission. A peace-loving man who owns a printing press embarks on the path of revenge after he loses his family, and later takes up cudgels on behalf of other victims like him who languish in prison. Sure, the story is outdated and clumsily narrated. What makes the experience all the more annoying is how the camera treats some of its women. The film doesn’t reveal the faces of the actors but has no problem tracing the curves of the women officers in the gym. Elsewhere, a corrupt and sinister doctor is portrayed to be all the more pathetic since she indulges in a same-sex relationship for money. Again, the camera lustfully moves on her. The same is the case with the woman featured with Posani Krishna Murali later. Ali, Vennela Kishore and Sunil are somewhat lucky to play television anchors since their identities are revealed and they get to deliver a few dialogues in their trademark manner.  Son of India ends up as a vain, indulgent exercise that made me wonder what the film’s team was thinking, if they were thinking at all. The mission is apparently incomplete and there is more to come. The hint at a sequel sounded like a punishment.",Sangeetha Devi Dundoo,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/son-of-india-movie-review-excruciatingly-painful-experiment/article65061855.ece
391,"February 14, 2022",16:55 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘Moonfall’ movie review: Perfect Nineties-style disaster movie," Didn’t Queen Hippolyta say it was the silliest stuff she had ever heard while watching the Rude Mechanicals’ play on Pyramus and Thisbe? Roland Emmerich’s  Moonfall, provokes a similar reaction. It is silly but immense fun. Emmerich, who has given us these ginormous disaster movies, from  Independence Day to  2012, is in fine fettle with this story of the moon being an alien ship and under attack.  As it is knocked off its orbit, the moon plays havoc with the earth’s tides, gravity and tectonic plates. Cue the tsunamis, earthquakes and volcanos. As things fall apart, it is time for a motley crew to mount an operation that seems doomed to fail but succeeds with rousing music and all. Oh what joy it is to see this kind of CGI destruction, secure in the knowledge that all will come right in the end!  What comfort to know that there are people who will do the right thing and save a world that is not laid low by an ever-mutating virus! In 2011, two NASA astronauts, Jo (Halle Berry) and Harper (Patrick Wilson) when repairing a satellite, see a mysterious swarm attack their orbiter, killing a colleague and knocking out Jo. No one believes Harper about the swarm, he is fired and the accident is put down to human error.  Ten years later, Harper is divorced and estranged from his son, Sonny (Charlie Plummer) while his wife, Brenda (Carolina Bartczak) has married Tom (Michael Peña). Jo is also divorced from Doug Davidson (Eme Ikwuakor), a four-star general with the US Army. Michelle (Kelly Yu), a foreign exchange student lives with Jo and is nanny to her son, Jimmy.  A conspiracy theorist and mega-structure expert, Houseman (John Bradley, Sam from  Game of Thrones) has been tracking the moon, which he believes is a superstructure constructed by aliens, discovers the moon is veering away from its orbit creating anomalies on earth. NASA finds out about the moon’s orbital disco-dance and tries to do their thing. When that fails and the clock is rapidly ticking away to doomsday, Jo, who is now Deputy Director of NASA, Harper and Houseman head off to the moon to make a last ditch effort to set things right.  There are other clocks ticking as well including Sonny, with Michelle and Jimmy trying to get the Davidson’s military bunker before the nuclear strike, Brenda, Tom and their two daughters trying to get to safety and random rioters rampaging on the countryside.

392,"February 13, 2022",18:44 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘DJ Tillu’ movie review: Siddhu steals the show in this outlandish comic caper," DJ Tillu takes a fresh look at the idea of a ‘mass’ film. There’s a familiar formula by which films targeting a large section of the audience, termed as ‘mass’ in Telugu film parlance, play out. But then, men and women that make up our cities do not fit into a pre-ascertained mould. If 2021’s smash hit Jathi Ratnalu dipped into the flavour of Jogipet on the outskirts of Hyderabad, DJ Tillu builds a fun ride centred on a wastrel from Malkajgiri in Secunderabad. Director Vimal Krishna, who shares the writing credits with the lead actor Siddhu Jonnalagadda, ensures that the narrative is packed with madcap fun moments.  We get an idea of who Tillu is right at the beginning when his distraught father comments that his son is safer in the hospital, in coma, than on the streets. Named and raised as Bal Gangadhar Tilak, the son later calls himself Tillu, sports colourful clothing and struts around claiming to be a DJ. He is an entitled brat who doesn’t feel guilty for squandering his father’s money but talks about wanting his ‘professional space’ when his parents are guests at the same event where he is at the turn table. Beneath all that self-created hype are small-time DJing opportunities that do not even afford Tillu a haircut in a posh salon; he tries in vain to make the hairstylist at the neighbourhood salon understand streaks and highlights.  When this wastrel, who thinks he is street smart, falls in love with Radhika (Neha Shetty), nothing remains the same. Radhika is designed as a morally ambiguous character whose moves evoke distrust not just in Tillu, but also us, the viewers. Is she a victim of liaisons that went wrong, an opportunist, or a mix of both? There’s a dead body along the way and things get increasingly messy. Tillu is torn between his love for Radhika and desperate to wriggle out of the situation.  The first hour is a riot anarrated with sharp humour and Tillu getting the best lines. It nearly becomes a one-man show as Siddhu gives it his all to play the eccentric character, owning the swag. It is also a physically demanding character, where his body language adds to the fun. He does this with no inhibition, unafraid to look silly in a few places.  Nothing Tillu says or does is there just for fun. The dance he does in front of an apartment complex and casual conversations in scenes that seem to be randomly placed at first, all come in handy to push the story forward.  When Radhika tells him to stop looking at her through the compass of morality, she is speaking to all those watching the film. The narrative, while showing how glamorous women are viewed as objects of lust, neither judges her nor gives her a clean chit. Neha Shetty pulls off this complex character well. Accentuating Tillu’s madcap world is Sricharan Pakala and Thaman’s vibrant music, cinematographer Saiprakash Ummadisingu’s almost psychedelic visual canvas and Avinash Kolla’s production design. Among the supporting cast, Brahmaji and Prince Cecil make an impression. Several others like Kireeti and Pragati get their moments. The fun wears off in the later portions. It is easy to see through the smokescreen of a pivotal character and the turnaround does not come across as a surprise. A few questions are also left answered. However, the film redeems itself to an extent.  After Jathi Ratnalu, DJ Tillu might be another film in which the fun quotient works better with collective viewing in the theatres. Tillu’s story isn’t over, yet.

393,"February 12, 2022",17:50 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘The Tinder Swindler’ review: Netflix’s latest true-crime documentary is a lesson in vulnerability,"  “This is an emotional con,” is how Natalie Remøe Hansen —a journalist whose piece in the Norwegian newspaper
VG inspired the documentary — describes the case of Simon Leviev, or as Netflix’s latest documentary calls him, “The Tinder Swindler.”
  Posing as the son of an Israeli diamond magnate, Leviev uses the dating app Tinder to first emotionally lure women into his life as the troubled “prince of diamonds”. He then makes them financially rescue him from his mortal enemies, sinking his teeth deeper into the woman’s personal funds with each new “threat” to his life.  There is of course no threat, because there is no Simon Leviev. The false heir uses the money he borrowed from one woman to sponsor his luxurious lifestyle, and flaunts the same in front of his next potential victim, spinning a yarn of deceit across multiple cities in Europe. But director Felicity Morris’s documentary is not about this conman; it is about the conned. She takes a gamble choosing to tell a small stakes story. This is not the story of a large-scale public scam; it is about very private losses. So why is it doing so well?  The answer lies in Morris’ choice to focus the documentary on the narratives of three women — Cecilie Fjellhøy, Pernilla Sjöholm, and Ayleen Charlotte — who were swindled by Leviev.   Unlike a typical conman documentary,
The Tinder Swindler doesn’t tread down the route of somewhat glorifying the conman. The film doesn’t marvel at the “genius” or the “artistry” of Leviev, nor does it break out into a visual spiel on the perfect crime.
 Instead, we see the complete financial downfall of these women, as they struggle to not only pay back debts, but also heal emotionally to eventually take Leviev head-on in the second half of the film.   The “emotional con” is finally resolved in the film by hardened candour, as Cecilie and Pernilla band together to expose Leviev’s whole schtick in one of Norway’s biggest newspapers, the
VG.  Therefore, vulnerability —Leviev’s weapon of choice — is turned against him as both women lay bare their whole journey into getting swindled.
 There is quiet bravery in this act as both Cecilie and Pernilla head into it fully knowing the consequences of exposing themselves.  The Tinder Swindler  “I don’t really want to share this story,” is the first thing Cecilie says in her interview with
VG . Public ridicule becomes part of the negotiation, as the film shows the brutal social media reaction to the article. The women are called “gold diggers” who deserved their loss. “All I did was just try to help people…I didn’t want anyone else to get hurt,” Pernilla says at one point in the documentary.
  Where most true-crime documentaries struggle in toeing the line between entertainment and telling a harrowing tale,
The Tinder Swindler gets it right by ensuring that sensitivity takes centre stage.
 Stylistically also, it is a delight to watch. The three women have all been interviewed at different restaurants, and the documentary starts with Cecilie’s interview. We spend nearly 21 minutes with her, listening to her story, and the film feels immersive, almost intimate, like you’re listening to a friend talking about her life.  The soft lighting in these scenes also provides much-needed relief from the social media posts and screenshots juxtaposed over the voiceover.  The film gains pace as it nears the end, giving the impression that we are hurtling towards a victory; that finally the conman has been cornered. However, the vindication proves to be tiny when compared to the buildup it received.  The documentary closes off with Cecilie, Pernilla and Ayleen expressing joy at Leviev’s arrest, but a montage at the end reveals that he only served one-third of his sentence, and currently is a free man. 
 
  Erlend Ofte Arnsten, an investigative journalist with
VG remarks that since the crime was “in their world…a small scam,” there was not enough incentive for the police to devote extensive resources towards pursuing Leviev.
The Times of Israel reported in 2020 that he was released as part of measures to reduce prison population fearing COVID-19 outbreak.
 Several articles published in local Israeli newspapers, following his release in 2020, have featured the reaction of Leviev’s victims, including Pernilla, who have registered their disappointment. This is something the documentary misses out on as well.  The story of Leviev and his victims doesn’t end here though. With the film garnering attention,
NBC News reported that Leviev has been banned by not only Tinder, but also other dating apps like Match.com and OkCupid.
 At the heart of it, the documentary feels like a continued act of vulnerable bravery for Cecilie, Pernilla, and Ayleen. A story which made a big splash in Norwegian and Israeli media is now trending across the world. This has prompted the three women, who still have financial debts to clear, to start a GoFundMe page. “All we want are our lives back,” they say.

  And there is also Grogu cooing and looking to gobble up levitating frogs instead of concentrating on his master’s instruction on the Jedi way and the Force. Luke does not seem that good a Jedi master forcing Grogu to make terrible choices. He is a rather grumpy teacher; nothing like the all-conquering Jedi who rescued Grogu from evil Moff Gideon in the season 2 finale of
The Mandalorian . Maybe that is why Ben Solo decided to go over to the Dark Side— Uncle Luke was no fun at all.
 The Book of Boba Fett The Book of Boba Fett is greatly helped by an imposing performance by Temuera Morrison. He has created an effective man behind the mask, filling in some of the blanks of what made Boba Fett the man he turned out to be. That “simmering violence” Morrison was aiming for in his portrayal of Fett is super effective.
 The show wears its space western identity with flair. Robert Rodriguez, who has directed three episodes, brings in a jingly jangly vibe to the proceedings. Strangers keep walking into bars and in the syndicate’s enforcer, Cad Bane (voiced by Corey Burton), there are traces of Lee Van Cleef’s Colonel Douglas Mortimer from For a Few Dollars More. Incidentally, George Lucas originally conceived of Boba as the man with no name, after thankfully giving up on the idea of Boba and Darth Vader being brothers.  There are so many call backs to the original trilogy from the rancor and Gamorrean guards to the blue elephant-like creature playing at the cantina. Incidentally Jennifer Beals makes for comely proprietor of the cantina—what a feeling indeed. Mention of spice wars brings to mind
Dune , but then Frank Herbert’s science fiction epic has generously lent to every space odyssey that followed.
 Jabba’s cousins, The Twins are naturally very different from Luke and Leia, but that little fan the girl carried was so sweet. There is a wookie too, a bounty hunter and former gladiator no less, sporting involved hair and limited speech called Krrsantan (Carey Jones). The major domo of the mayor of Mos Espa played by David Pasquesi has all the fun lines. The cyborgs led by Drash (Sophie Thatcher) working for Boba seemed slightly unnecessary. There are some nice touches such as Djarin checking in his many weapons on his flight to Tatooine, and Danny Trejo as the rancor trainer telling Fett, “Rancors are emotionally complex creatures.” The train-raid is electrifying and reminded one of Jai, Veeru and Thakur in that other western. And there is Tatooine, a “garden of many bounties” in the words of Peli Moto with a mention of oceans in the desert planet’s distant past. And if none of this floats your boat, there is always Grogu… The Book of Boba Fett is currently streaming on Disney+Hotstar", Mini Anthikad Chibber,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-book-of-boba-fett-review-wears-its-space-western-identity-with-flair/article38417947.ece

But, the proposal comes at a tough time for her, having lost her temporary job as a school teacher, a job which enabled her to take care of her family. Despite the setbacks, the proposal seems to be working out and the preparations are on for the wedding, when an unexpected news about the groom reaches her the night before the wedding. As for his intent, there is nothing to blame director Akhil Anilkumar for. He has packaged in everything from the unwelcome questions from strangers and distant relatives, to the constant pressure from the family that a girl nearing the “marriageable” age has to face. In fact, in the initial half, the film somewhat succeeds in portraying the struggles of Archana, in taking care of the family and organising her own wedding. Archana 31 Not Out But then, the conflict point arrives and things start going horribly wrong. One begins to get a bad feeling about the entire thing when the film slips into a bit of a forced fantasy narrative, when she imagines the different scenarios that might take place if she reveals the news to the family. It is unbelievable, but almost the entire second half is written around Archana worrying about how this news would affect her family. The cycle of worrying and sharing her woes with some other characters seems never-ending, that one wishes the protagonist also showed a little concern for the audience who have to repeatedly sit through the same story. Although the film attempts to redeem itself in a climax sequence which has a laudable idea, by then the audience are too tired to take in all the positive vibes that the script seeks to generate. It is not often that a film which is less than two hours in runtime gives us the feeling of being so excruciatingly long. Some bland, pointless writing in the second half spoils what could have been an interesting subject for a short film. The characters, including a bunch of drunken old men, and sequences, like a running battle between two neighbours, which are meant to evoke laughter, fall flat. Archana might not be out, but there is no one left to bat at the other end, and the match is lost, by quite a wide margin. Archana 31 Not Out is currently running in theatres",S.R.

The Murder on the Orient Express, Death on the Nile  finally steams in two years late. Has the wait been worth it? Comme ci, comme ça, would be my reply.

You can subscribe for free here  Though the film was not shot in Egypt (CGI and Morocco to the rescue), some of the establishing shots are lovely. The costumes are exquisite and it is always fun to watch a glittering, glitzy ensemble cast do their thing.
Death on the Nile , however, falls short by several degrees on the mystery side. Based on Agatha Christie’s eponymous novel, this is the third adaptation following the 1978 film with Peter Ustinov as Poirot and an episode in
Agatha Christie’s Poirot with David Suchet.
 All who enjoy Christie novels for the cleverly put-together puzzles and familiar characters, are sure to be disappointed with this version which spends time on a back story for Poirot’s (Branagh) magnificent moustaches and lost love—no, not the Countess Rossakoff, and not much on clues, suspects and Poirot exercising his little grey cells.  Characters from the book have either been excised or changed around or combined. So while there is no Colonel Race, the angry young nobleman, Mr Fergusson, and Dr Bessner have been combined to form Dr Windlesham (Russell Brand). Even more bizarre is converting Tim Allerton and his mum to Bouc (Tom Bateman, from
Orient Express ) and his mum Euphemia (Annette Bening).
 Death on the Nile Salome Otterbourne (Sophie Okonedo) is no longer the sad romance novelist no one reads anymore with a drinking problem. She is instead a successful singer who just might have captured Poirot’s heart. Rosalie (Letitia Wright) is not her daughter as in the book but her niece and business manager. Marie Van Schuyler (Jennifer Saunders) is not a kleptomaniac rather she is communist who has given all her wealth to the party. Her companion, Mrs. Bowers, is played by Dawn French. Incidentally Maggie Smith was a hoot as Bowers in the 1978 version. Despite all these changes, the central mystery and resolution remains the same; so, if you have read the book, then you will know the resolution and be annoyed or indifferent to Branagh’s alterations. Jacqueline (Emma Mackey) and Simon Doyle (Armie Hammer) are desperately in love but penniless. Jacqueline’s best friend, Linnet (Gal Gadot) is a wealthy heiress and Jacqueline feels if Linnet were to hire Simon as her estate manager, all their money problems would be sorted. Unfortunately, Simon is dazzled by Linnet and he breaks off his engagement to Jacqueline to marry Linnet. A furious Jacqueline follows the couple on their honeymoon in Egypt, making a scene much to Linnet’s chagrin. A murder happens aboard a luxury steamer on the Nile and Poirot steps in to solve the crime.  Emma Mackey (Maeve from
Sex Education ) makes for a wonderful Jacqueline, while Gadot looks regal as Linnet. Ali Fazal plays Linnet’s crooked lawyer, while Rose Leslie is Linnet’s maid, Louise, who also bears a grudge against her. Branagh as Poirot is not as distracting as he was in
Orient Express and he thankfully does not giggle as he reads Dickens.
  While there was a hint of Branagh tackling
The Murder of Roger Ackroyd next—it was the growing of vegetable marrows, the ending seems to suggest that Branagh is done with the Belgian sleuth… which may not be such a bad thing.

Does financial constraint ever come in the way of their relationships? Can these characters find their way into a full-fledged feature film, once in a while? In the past, Zoya and Farhan Akhtar have offered a slice of life into the lives of this privileged lot, without being judgmental. Here director Shakun Batra goes a step further as he painstakingly dissects the lives of a set of upwardly mobile young people who love to surf in more ways than one Alisha (Deepika Padukone), a yoga instructor, discovers that she is stuck in a relationship with her live-in partner Karan (Dhairya Karwa), an advertisement executive who has chucked his soul-sucking job to become a writer. Alisha’s cousin Tia ( Ananya Panday) is getting married to Zain (Siddhant Chaturvedi), a cool, ambitious businessman who seems to have not lost his sensitive side in the stock market. When the four vivacious souls meet, Alisha and Zain strike a chord because of their similar past experiences and modest backgrounds. Zain wants to come out of the influence of the overbearing parents of Tia, and Alisha finds that she is in danger of being reduced to a doormat if she spends more time with Karan. As sparks fly, we get to see a passionate romance between Deepika and Siddhant under the guidance of intimacy director Dar Gai, perhaps a first for Hindi cinema. The evocative background sound and Kaushal Shah’s immersive cinematography ensure that the embrace of mighty waves doesn’t remain just a Discovery Channel kind of shot. Gehraiyaan  The trailer was all about sensuality shot with a soft lens, but Batra, like his last outing
Kapoor & Sons,  soon digs deep into facades. Beneath the killer attitude and flimsy attires, the romantic drama holds a mirror to our manicured generation. That vocabulary apart, it was not that the previous generation used to get stuck only in traffic jams. Their bonds also developed scars, but perhaps they didn’t have enough courage to find avenues to move out. Or were they a little less self-seeking?
 The generation that Batra deals with here is all about options. Moving on has become a catchphrase, without realising it is a spherical world. The film quietly impresses upon that like in big corporate houses, there is an evaluation gap in relationships as well which young boys and girls want to fill through means that are not always honest. The best part is that the four writers don’t allow the script to become long-winded. There is space for silences, brooding, deep inhales and the emotional turmoil to seep through. The conversations and performances create a vivid lived reality. The space could be distant for some audiences, but it is never escapist. Read More | Raw, real and atmospheric: The music of ‘Gehraiyaan’ The dialogues are short and smart, and often provide the character sketch. For instance, when Karan remarks in jest that he thought Tia was potty-trained when she referred to her pottery training, it is not more than just a witty response. It gives us a sense of Tia’s naive personality who cannot easily figure out what her boyfriend was up to. For a long part, Zain seems Zen-like in his relationships: cool, calm, and collected. When Alisha gets stuck, he advises her to look out for herself. But as he unravels, we realise it is a hollow credo, something Karan, who comes across as a chauvinist till then, pointed at early. It is the little twists that keep us invested, as the romantic drama has been structured and edited as a thriller. Crucial information is held back and characters behave against the type to pull little surprises, till the satisfying end, like the tenuous bond between Alisha and her father (Naseeruddin Shah) that stays with you and leaves a lump in the throat. Both Deepika and Siddhant have been able to portray the emotions of being with somebody who is both the ailment and the cure. In a tailor-made role, Deepika is effortless in portraying both the sassy and vulnerable aspects of Alisha.  Easy on the eyes,
Siddhant plays the flawed Zain with conviction.
Ananya is the surprise package as Tia. One thought she is fit only for the ebullient part, but she is persuasive till the end. Dhairya provides good support and Rajat Kapoor and Naseeruddin Shah add heft to the proceedings from the sidelines.

We see a farcical romance that leads to his marriage but just before the interval, the members of his family are murdered.

There is a backstory as well of Raja Shekar (Rao Ramesh) who brings up the orphan Mohan Gandhi; he is trapped in a money laundering case by the home minister (Mukesh Rishi) and his son. This aspect becomes a catalyst in Mohan Gandhi’s journey to usurp a vast amount of currency belonging to the home minister’s son.
Film: Khiladi There are innumerable characters, all played by big names. The film production appears slick and expensive as if to justify the story about money laundering. So there are foreign locales, high-end cars, guns, rifles and the works... But does the narration and an aging Ravi Teja complement each other?  The second half falters with too many twists and turns;
Khiladi is solely aimed at the hero’s fans and those who love formula-driven movies.
 If you do not follow the story closely, you could end up wondering if Ravi Teja has played a dual role. Chitra (Dimple Hayathi) adds credence and Meenakshi has done a convincing job. Ravi Teja plays to the gallery but he could benefit from better makeup. All the songs are interesting but the cinematography is not up to the mark. Vennela Kishore fails to elicit laughs as Ravi Teja grabs the best lines. More focus on entertainment could have been a shot in the arm to the director. It is okay to watch a formula film just for fun but what puts the viewer off is the justification of the crime.

The response would depend on everything from their immediate concerns, their social and economic situation and the level of education and exposure. Freedom of one kind or the other is supposed to be the common strand which connects the five segments in this anthology film. But in some of the segments, it is not so perceptible on the surface, while in some others, it is in your face or almost non-existent.

His wife Lali (Lali.P.M), on the other hand, has finally found the time to do the things that she always wanted, especially the running of a small home-based business, now that her children are settled in their lives. The seemingly-simple wishes are but not easily achievable for the couple, especially due to the expectations of those around them, including each other. Dhanu (Rohini), the househelp with her own share of issues, seems to understand both better. True to its subject, which is based on the real-life struggles of ‘Penkoottu,’ a union of unorganised women workers in Kozhikode, ‘Asanghadithar’ directed by Kunjila Maschillamani uses a judicious mixture of cinematic narrative and documentary-style making. It captures the slow building of anger, and the formation of a movement, as the women protest the lack of access to toilets and brave the taunts of their male employers. Though it feels a bit stretched out after a point, Srinda, real-life ‘Penkoottu’ leader Viji.P and the band of women keep the interest alive with their light-heartedness amid all the struggle. Freedom Fight In ‘Geethu Unchained’, directed by Akhil Anilkumar, Geethu (Rajisha Vijayan) is fed up with satisfying the expectations of the society. She is keen on not repeating the mistakes that others, including her mother, have made. But, it is not easy for her, with a boyfriend who changes his colour after their engagement, a colleague who develops interest in her, and a mother who constantly dictates things to her. It is the kind of film that would appeal to many youths, and it is laudable that the makers did not force a happy ending. Jithin Issac Thomas’s ‘Pra Thoo Mu’ draws its title from O.V.Vijayan’s classic opening line from ‘Dharmapuranam’. A blocked septic tank at a minister’s and his attitude to the men who came to clean it, makes one of the men to rebel. It is an unequal battle, but the anger of years of oppression and contempt might be too hard for the minister to take. Jithin’s film, visualised in black-and-white, is meant to shock and awe the viewer, yet some of the proceedings seem a bit too forced, despite the very important issue that it is trying to raise. Francies Louis’s ‘Ration’ seeks to highlight inequality through a story centred on the sharing of food items between two neighbouring households. Wasteful consumption and the struggle to earn the daily bread are placed side by side, with the stark contrasts making a striking impact at a time when a large section of the population had to depend on rations for daily survival. ‘Freedom Fight’ works better than many of the over-hyped anthologies, which have given the whole idea a bad name, but the common theme that connects all is just about barely visible in some.

You can subscribe for free here  For starters, the story does not judge men and women who part ways. It understands what they go through - the reason could be something harrowing like dowry harassment, sexual harassment or something that is often overlooked, like incompatibility. The story also doesn’t have characters doling out advice to women and warning that life gets tough after divorce. Instead, it depicts a male point of view, highlighting that separation is not a smooth ride for them either.
Malli Modalaindi Chef Vikram (Sumanth Kumar) grew up admiring the strength of his mother Sujatha (Suhasini), an entrepreneur whose spice business grows manifold. He takes to cooking naturally and becomes a chef. Narrated matter of factly, the situation gently asserts that it is not unthinkable in a traditional household of the late 1990s for an adolescent boy to spend time in the kitchen. We get a quick recap of how things have soured between Vikram and Nisha (Varshini Sounderarajan). Rather than live with an unhappy marriage, they decide to move on with mutual respect, rather than slugging it out in court. However, the narrative soon contrasts Vikram and Nisha with Kishore (Vennela Kishore as a motivational speaker) and his wife. Kishore cannot cease referring to his wife as a boar and she uses him as a punching bag. The idea of starting life afresh after divorce and topics of mental health and therapy (Manjula Ghattamaneni in a cameo as a therapist) find their way into the story. The issues are addressed at the surface level, but are fairly sensitively dealt with. While these stretches are written sensibly, the comic portions are rather banal. Vennela Kishore tries his best to evoke laughter with the lines written for him; some jokes land while others sound lame. Sample this: “They say that love is like walking in the park, but yours has turned out like Jurassic Park.” Or the pointless limerick “Why does the sun glow? Why are you so low? What is happening? Let’s go with the flow”... If these bits had also been written with some zing, the film would have made for a crackling romance drama laced with comedy. The romance between Vikram and the divorce lawyer Pavithra (Naina Ganguly) could have done with some spark. The idea of a man falling in love with his wife’s divorce lawyer sounds better on paper than it appears on screen. However, as the story progresses it finds its rhythm and addresses Vikram’s insecurities and how he battles the fear of history repeating itself. Sumanth is a good fit for the role, gamely playing a character that realises he has to measure up to the strong women around him. There’s also a comment about the age difference between the couple. In how many mainstream films do we hear of statements that could be perceived as unflattering to the typical image of the hero? Sumanth plays Vikram with the subtlety required and delivers the emotional portions effectively with understated restraint. Naina Ganguly and Varshini are adequate, and Chinmayi’s voice does some of the heavy lifting for Naina.  In Anup Rubens music, the ‘Alone Alone’ track by Sid Sriram does stand out. A few comic dialogues also made me wonder if Keerthi Kumar or anyone in the film’s core team is a huge Hollywood fan, for there are several references to Christopher Nolan,
Interstellar and the characters of
TheAvengers franchise.
 Malli Modalaindi has its heart in the right place; it is a well intentioned drama that could have done with some more spark in the writing.

Bhamakalapam finds its feet, it is hard not to be reminded of the 2018 Hindi film
Andhadhun , even if faintly. A lamb crosses the path and a car meets with an accident that changes the course of things. The story is centred on the female protagonist Anupama Mohan (Priyamani), who is a homemaker and YouTuber known for her culinary skills. When push comes to shove, she uses her skill sets for something darker. Incidents of crime keep happening and on occasions, what happens around them is a laugh riot. The plot bears no resemblance to
Andhadhun but this film exists in a zone that is similar to that widely appreciated macabre crime comedy.
Bhamakalapam  Headlining
Bhamakalapam  is a fantastic Priyamani who plays the overtly inquisitive homemaker Anupama with elan. Even when Anupama is busy filming videos for her YouTube channel, she keeps an eye on what is happening in her neighbourhood. Early on we are privy to a hilarious turn of events when she tries to unravel a neighbour’s extramarital affair. Her snooping backfires and she, thoroughly embarrassed, promises her husband (Pradeep Rudra) that she will not peek out of the window again. But fate has different plans for her.

Bhamakalapam  refers to a story of a headstrong, proud Satyabhama . In this film, the makers give us a story of a headstrong but innocent homemaker who gets pulled into unexpected events. What she and the others involved in the mess face is the ‘dance of fate’.
 The rundown middle-class apartment complex teems with interesting characters, including a pastor who awaits divine events. Elsewhere, a Faberge egg worth ₹ 200 crores has been stolen. As fate would have it, this stolen egg is lost (again). Several crates of real eggs are crushed in a mission to find the Faberge egg and someone is murdered. And then another.  The crime network has a colourful character in the form of Nayar (John Vijay) who takes on Anupama and finds that she is no timid homemaker. The portions involving Anupama and the house help Shilpa (Sharanya Pradeep) are hilarious, particularly when they become unwilling partners in crime. In fact,
Bhamakalapam is populated with interesting women. A heavily pregnant female investigation officer (Shanti Rao) tries to solve the crime that turns out to be murkier than it looks and another character Saira, a survivor of domestic abuse, is also integral to the plot.
 Around 45 minutes prior to the end, key revelations are made. Though we know the identity of the culprit, the film manages to intrigue as things go haywire, justifying the dance of fate. The crime comedy is anchored with a statement to look within to find God, rather than be misled by anyone who uses religion as a weapon. An egg becomes the symbol of God’s return to the earth and the lamb that has steered off course is also part of the discourse. The casting is on cue for the supporting parts as well. Deepak Yeragera’s cinematography, Viplav Nyshadam’s editing and music by Justin Prabhakaran and Mark K Robin add to the comic thriller mood. Take for instance when the violins add crescendo to the sequence when Anupama finds herself dragged into a quicksand-like situation, wishing that she had never taken that step fuelled by her inquisitiveness. Bhamakalapam is an interesting departure from mainstream Telugu film tropes, coming from the creative team of showrunner Bharat Kamma and director Abhimanyu.

He keeps attending job interviews, which invariably end up with the question: Are you religious? His mother works with the police, and his tryst with the police station is limited to the time he brings food for his mother.

 FIR FIR ’s strength and weakness are somehow the same thing: its speed. With multiple cities like Chennai, Bangalore and Kochi being showcased within a few minutes, this racy script might be a little tough to follow for people who are used to gentler, slower films. Various characters get introduced, and before you can register them, the film moves on to another character, another location. But the speed keeps the viewer interested, which could well work in its favour in the theatres, which are finding it hard to draw audiences who are used to consuming content in the comfort of their homes on OTT platforms.
  Vishnu Vishal has certainly grown as an actor in recent times. Post the thrilling
Ratsasan , which was a wonderful theatrical experience in 2018, he seems to have become a lot more serious about the craft of cinema. As Irfan, he delivers a sincere performance; one that successfully conveys the flutter between ambition and anguish.
 Gautham Menon gets a role that requires more presence than nuance, and he does the job. To the director’s credit, he also tries to showcase three female characters (played by Manjima Mohan, Raiza Wilson and Reba Monica John)… that they get at least one solid scene each augurs well for the film. How they all come together in their own ways in the final explanation, is among the highlights of the film.

404,"February 10, 2022",13:38 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘Mahaan’ movie review: Vikram shines in this ambitious but overstuffed gangster epic," By now, there are a few things we have come to expect in a Karthik Subbaraj film – sorry, ‘A Karthik Subbaraj padam’. A fairly popular old song that kind of fits the film’s narrative; a smattering of Rajinikanth movie references; a character named Michael; a cameo by Subbaraj’s father, Gajaraj… what else? Oh, yes, of course: the famous Karthik Subbaraj Twist™. These tropes and motifs can be viewed as signatures of an auteur or as repetitions that get a bit tiresome.

Mahaan , you have mixed feelings about it. In fact, you have mixed feelings about the whole film as well.
 It is by no means an ordinary film, because Subbaraj has attempted an epic. We have a sprawling drama, spanning decades. We notice the lives of three key characters crisscrossing each other; their fates, inevitably intertwined. We witness history repeating itself. If all this is not enough evidence of an epic, then there is Santhosh Narayanan’s trumpet-heavy background score that accentuates the drama. The film opens with this Mohandas Gandhi quote: “Freedom is not worth having if it does not include the freedom to make mistakes.” What follows is the story of someone named Gandhi Mahaan (Vikram), who ends up making mistakes with a capital M. Mahaan  Gandhi’s grandfather and father are followers of, well,
Gandhi. His father is so devoted to his ideology that he changes his son’s birthday from August 16 to August 15 on his birth certificate. Later, Gandhi marries Naachi (Simran), who is also a staunch Gandhian. She teaches her little son to shut his eyes if he sees a Hollywood movie poster because she believes these films contain violence and sex. Gandhi is not merely surrounded by Gandhians, he is stifled by them. Their expectation to emulate a man who is revered as a Mahatma burdens him. For, Gandhi’s inclination is to travel the path of pleasures -- even if they are considered sinful.
  Because of his father and wife, Gandhi, till he turns 40, lives -- rather, forces himself to live -- according to the Gandhian ways. But life takes a dramatic turn at 40 when he runs into his boyhood buddy Sathyavan (Simha), who has taken over his father’s alcohol business. Committing one sin after another, Gandhi becomes anti-
Gandhi , and soon, he has a big life choice to make.
 Vikram is fantastic as Gandhi Mahaan. He transitions effortlessly from a timid school teacher to a gun-wielding alcohol baron. His eyes convey the delightful menace when he finds out for the first time that he is capable of violence. They are equally effective in showing his helplessness as a man who has to make a tough choice. The rest of the main cast do a fine job as well (Dhruv’s performance is, however, a little overpitched). Simha, especially, is impressive as Sathyavan. Subbaraj is in no hurry while fleshing out these characters. And, that is fine because you do not expect a gangster drama to travel at a breakneck pace.  One of the problems with
Mahaan  is that it does not quite hit you as it should. For instance, there is a point where Gandhi tells Sathyavan, “Oru vaazhkai, varalara vazhanum” [roughly translates to ‘We got one life, make history’]. It is an epic, hair-raising line on paper. But your hair does not rise when it is uttered on screen.
 Another issue is the inconsistency in Gandhi’s emotional graph. There is a point where he is crestfallen, burdened by his own deeds. He looks like he has lost the will to live. But there is an abrupt liberation after which he returns to his audacious self.  In its last hour or so, you find the film trying to do too many things. We follow a father-son rivalry, a story of a man paying for his sins, a battle of two ideologies… and, of course, amidst all this, we get a twist as well (because this is a Karthik Subbaraj padam). It is admirable that
Mahaan attempts to juggle all this. But after a point, it gets a bit excessive. And you wonder if the film should have listened to a line from its protagonist. “Everything in moderation. That’s the right way to be.”
 Mahaan is currently streaming on Amazon Prime

405,"February 08, 2022",16:02 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘Kadaisi Vivasayi’ movie review: M Manikandan’s poignant ode to the old-fashioned farmer," (Spoilers below)  There is something different about director M Manikandan that sets him apart from his peers, if his body of work —
Kaaka Muttai ,
Kuttrame Thandanai and
Aandavan Kattalai — were to be considered. His debut film
Kaaka Muttai  was a masterpiece: a children-centred film that uses a Satyajit Ray-like humanist realism to make a searing point on consumerism and class differences.
Aandavan Kattalai was a light-hearted take on aspirations, but also depicted its story and characters as close to reality without giving up on humour and cinematic sense. This writer hasn’t seen
Kuttrame Thandanai but just the two other movies were enough to whet the appetite of viewers who had to wait months for the release of
Kadaisi Vivasayi  (The Last Farmer), Manikandan’s fourth film and perhaps the most poignant of the lot.

You can subscribe for free here  As the title indicates,
Kadaisi … is a take on the state of affairs in Indian farming today. The trope is familiar; very few in today’s rural India see merit in farming as a viable vocation and rare is the villager today who aspires to keep engaged in the rough and tumble that comes with agriculture. But what sets
Kadaisi … apart is the treatment given to the subject, and that is where Manikandan’s craft comes into play.
  Similar to his
Kaaka Muttai and Lenin Bharathi’s
Merku Thodarchi Malai , the key roles in this film are not played by actors, or at least by those who are familiar to audiences. This is clearly done for the purpose of authenticity. Except for Vijay Sethupathi and Yogi Babu, both of whom appear in cameos, there are no other prominent faces. The central character, Maayandi (Nallandi), is played by a person who cannot be anyone else but an inveterate farmer himself. Other supporting roles are also essayed by locals of a village near Usilampatti, where the film is set in. What differentiates these characters and actors from typical Tamil films with a rural backdrop, is that these are not simply bystanders or spectators who occupy screen space, but look and behave like real people.
 The dose of realism imbued to the characters and the settings is what sets the stage for the message being delivered by the director: that farming as an activity requires the protagonist to put forth the hard yards to keep it going against heavy odds. It is no surprise that every other landowner-farmer in the village has sold their holdings for a quick buck; one of them even buys an elephant and uses it for remunerative purposes. Maayandi is not just the “last farmer” in the village; he is a simpleton untouched by the comforts of modernity, as evident from the absence of electricity in his household or mechanised equipment for farming. A loner, he sticks to his profession not just as a means of livelihood, but as his way of oneness with nature. It is no wonder that when some village elders decide to appease the village deity by performing rites with the presence of all communities, they put the onus on Maayandi to provide the fresh offering of grains harvested in his small farm. Maayandi goes about his job with his typical fervour, even as land grabbers seek to buy his fecund land holdings only for their offer to be resolutely turned down. They try to fix Maayandi for this. A case is pinned on him by the police for killing peacocks. The magistrate who hears his case is easily convinced of his innocence, stuck by Maayandi’s desperation to go to the field and tend to his life-bearing crops. But the long arm of the law doesn’t spare him. He is kept in remand for days before the police take their sweet time to fix their bureaucratic mistakes. It falls on his fellow villagers and a police constable (due to a reprimand by the magistrate) to take care of his crop and without Maayandi’s knowhow and nurture, this task is clearly not easy for them. Finally, when Maayandi is released from remand, the entire village transcends its bitter casteist divide, and even the magistrate is moved by his dedication. They take part in helping reap the produce with a happy ending.  It is the process of how this transformation occurs within the village that drives the second half of the film, and the director tugs at the heart of the viewer as much as that of the fellow villagers and the agencies of the state to realise the importance of the
kadaisi vivasayi . It is not just realism or emotional intrigue that are used by Manikandan to make his point. He relies on surrealism in Vijay Sethupathi’s character as Ramaiah. Ramaiah has issues with mental health and has lost his moorings because of a personal tragedy. Unlike other villagers who regard Ramaiah with amusement or mirth, Maayandi sees it to be perfectly fine in breaking bread or sharing his emotions with him. This is in sharp contrast to his interactions with others which are laced with biting wit, a bit of derision or indifference. It is as if Maayandi is as out of tune with reality in his insistence on dedication to his craft as Ramaiah is, but their innate humanity and bond with nature binds them as kindred spirits.
 To this writer, Maayandi, Ramaiah and other characters in the film are not too different from the farmers from Tamil Nadu who went to New Delhi a few years ago to register their pain against the Government in bizarre ways. For the Indian peasant, an oneness with nature, expressed in monsoon cycles, soil, reliance on domestic animals and even the presence of wild birds such as peacocks is a given and faith in divinity, is tied to their dependence on nature. Manikandan expresses this not through the typical cinematic method of dialogues and messaging, but through a combination of realism and surrealism. This might seem incongruous to urban viewers, but I suspect it will strike a chord with the villager in rural Tamil Nadu — who is the key audience that Manikandan seems to target in his ode to the old-fashioned farmer. Kadaisi Vivasayi will release in theatres on February 11

Even as Roscoe, Ritchie and Colin discover themselves, while having a bunch of wild adventures, there is a disquieting disease that is infecting and killing their friends.

It’s a Sin As AIDS comes closer, the boys confront the disease with denial, fear, bravery, guilt, suspicion and shame. What is obvious from the show is that public reactions to a killer virus have not changed that very much in the last 40 years. There are the wild rumours jostling for space in the public consciousness including faddish cures, dire warnings and knee-jerk legislations including the repressive Section 28 prohibiting the promotion of homosexuality. Jill works to spread awareness even as Britain reacts with disgust and distrust. Russell T Davies has created a loving tribute to the lost boys of the decade.

The show, which begins in September 1981, ends in 1991, with the flatmates of the Pink Palace unalterably changed just like the world around them. Though the show was originally going to be called Boys, the name was changed to avoid confusion with the superhero show,
The Boys . Using the Pet Shop Boys’ single for the title is apt for a series that looks at the agony and ecstasy of growing up in a rigidly-compartmentalised world, that does not look kindly at anyone or anything that marches to a different drum.

You can subscribe for free here Reportedly based on Sean Payton’s stint as the coach of the New Orleans Saints, the movie begins with a peek into the 2009-11 NFL scandal that came to be known as ‘Bountygate’. However, the narrative promptly brushes the incident under the carpet, and instead points the floodlights on a hapless football team of 12-year-olds (Payton’s estranged son among them) who enlist Payton as their coach. If it were not for the passing references to Payton’s former life as an NFL guru, one could easily mistake him for another dad-turned-coach training his son’s football team.  With notable names including Kevin James, Taylor Lautner and Rob Schneider gracing the screen, the movie comes close to finding an emotional hook that could anchor its insipid storyline. But a string of unresolved plotlines, impossible scenarios and stereotypical characters sound the death knell early on. Sean Payton (played by James) is portrayed as a no-nonsense, aggressive coach who tells his players to ‘suck it up’ when they’re tired. When his mistrusting son confronts him about his decision to coach a gaggle of preteens, he has no answer. The tension between them is acknowledged, but never fully explored.  Home Team  The movie is barely consistent in its tone. Although it claims to be a ‘sports comedy’, the story is interspersed with moments of forced humour that feel misplaced, and it is unclear whether
Home Team  aspires to be a biopic, a sports movie or a family film. Even in its relatively serious scenes, it falls short of conjuring meaningful moments. The final nail in the coffin comes in the form of an unrealistic victory... during which Payton’s team secures a win by puking on their opponents. While the slapstick humour may appeal to children, this brand of comedy rarely elicits a chuckle in older audiences.
 The story is also dented by a host of uninspiring personas; a bumbling assistant coach who doubles as a (sometimes literal) punching bag, a simpering single mom on the lookout for love, and a dull-witted assistant, to name a few. The saving grace of the film can be found in its child actors, who joyfully sink their teeth into their roles. The result is a pack of talkative, happy-go-lucky boys who understand football mostly through food metaphors.  Home Team takes too many detours, and tests the limits of its genre in trying to address everything from teenage awkwardness and young love to a career crisis. Much like the players in the movie, it is rather content with a touchdown than aspire for victory.

 The eight-episode series pragmatically debates patriotism, pacifism, and the perils of the arms race. Well-researched, the scientific and political jargons seamlessly flow into dialogues, and the scale matches the weight of the people whose story it tells. The series manages to transport us into the era when a bullock cart-driven nation was struggling to take a leap. The classrooms, the labs, the equipment, and the overall ambiance permeate with the scent of chalk and a spirit of adventure. When the big boys play with their toys, it generates infectious energy that is hard to define, but the goosebumps aren’t easy to ignore either. Amidst the sprawling canvas spread over decades before and after 1947, the focus is on Bhabha (Jim Sarbh) and Sarabhai (Ishwak Singh). How they move from a student-teacher relationship and forge a life-long friendship and, along the way, inform each other’s world view, forms the crux of the story. Because of Sarabhai, Bhabha sheds his individualistic approach and, in turn, instills worldly confidence into the seemingly-docile Sarabhai. Their casual conversations open a window to the role of scientists in society. Abhay also brings in the conflict between machine and man and, like any good conversation, it comes across as a two-way process. Not to forget the politics, espionage, and betrayal that find their way into the scholarly universe as well. Putting the present-day controversies in context, Jawaharlal Nehru’s (Rajit Kapoor) dilemmas on China and the atomic bomb have been effectively dealt with. In easily his most fleshed-out performance , Jim imbues the character with mercurial energy that keeps you invested in the series even when he is not in the frame. A multifaceted personality who could quote Einstein and Shakespeare in the same sentence, Bhabha comes across as a mix of erudition and audacity and Jim lives the contradiction effortlessly.
 As the genteel but determined Sarabhai, Ishwak Singh proves to be an effective foil to Sarbh. His honest smile wins half of the battle in essaying a complex role. The creative liberties and fictitious characters don’t come in the way of storytelling. What we get to see are the human faces behind the great scientists, with their flaws and limitations. Be it Sarabhai’s inability to measure the thin line between arts and science, or his struggle with understanding the ambitions of his highly talented wife, we get to feel the limitations of the bright persona. Similarly, Bhabha’s inorganic bond with Parvana Irani (Saba Azad) gives us a sense of the times and how circumstances corrode relationships. At times, the dialogues — by Abhay and Kausar Munir — feel very today in terms of the expressions used, but are consistently sharp and laced with subtle wit, conveying the differences between the big boys about reaching the same goal.  The immaculate casting and measured performances ensure that the problems with pacing don’t wean you away from the in-between episodes. Kapoor pitches it just right as Pandit Nehru.
Regina Cassandra is quite magnetic as Mrinalini Sarabhai , who deserves a separate film.
 As the fictitious disgruntled scientist Mehdi Raza, Dibyendu Bhattacharya provides an immensely likable counterpoint to Sarbh. Both Regina and Dibyendu add the much-needed texture to the proceedings as they hold their own in front of Sarbh. Arjun Radhakrishnan’s physical presence might not match Kalam’s well-documented persona, but his earnest performance makes up for it. Just like the manual intervention won the day for Sarabhai and Bhabha, Abhay’s human touch puts this rocket of a series in the right trajectory. Rocket Boys is currently streaming on SonyLIV

Veeramae Vaagai Soodum to become one. These interconnected events, though taking place under varying circumstances, have one thing in common. A similar situation unfolds to the three main characters where they are put in a tight spot and have to make up their minds: either succumb to power or take the bull by its horns. They decide for themselves and pay the price too. But the way these scenes are put together by the editor NB Srikanth and director Thu Pa Saravanan is perhaps the only time in the nearly three-hour-long film we get to see the flourishes of the director at the helm. The rest of the film is mostly dull and dead.

You can subscribe for free here  By the impression of the interval point, we get a sense of a “big” hero moment. But the result it produces is far and few in between. An idea without execution remains just an idea and
Veeramae Vaadai Soodum seems content with a few interesting ideas; some of these aren’t exactly great and give us a sense of deja vu from the textbook of
masala cinema. But the problem is deeper; the film does not have a spine to hold your attention for three hours and comes across as a culmination of
masala moments from previous films. And these “mass” moments aren’t new, aren’t effective or big enough.
  At the centre, we have Porus aka Purushothaman (Vishal who seems equally disinterested with the proceedings), who aspires to be a police officer but gets sucked into a cycle of violence. Think of Mohanlal’s
Kireedam , minus the brilliant star cast and writing. But Porus remains porous throughout. He has a sister (Raveena Ravi) whose name I did not care to notice. She could be Shanthi, Mala, Kavitha or Jennifer, or just a
thangachi . But what you do know is, she wouldn’t last beyond the interval.
  As is the case with the heroine (Dimple Hayathi), about whom you were right all along. She comes here and there, just to remind us she had given call sheets. In her introduction scene, she makes a loud statement about sexual harassment which is easily the most laugh-out-loud moment. You have to pore through
Veeramae... to find with such gems.
 But these films are never about women, right? And even if so, it is to accentuate the high points for the hero. Anyway, Porus has to find his purpose, which will lead him to the villain. Hence, Porus’ sister is the sacrificial lamb.  If revenge is the core idea, then Vishal himself has acted in a superb revenge-drama called
Pandiya Naadu , where he goes against the people who killed his brother with a terrific performance by Bharathiraja. But revenge is not
Veeramae ’s main concern. It wants the hero to have a larger purpose. Think of this: Porus loses his sister to become
anna for the other. There is a brilliant scene involving a crocodile feeder towards the end. Again, an idea without execution is just an idea. The writing in
Veeramae… is awful; heroic moments needed more thought and perhaps the film needed a bigger budget too. Actors and dialogues don’t help either; they give a
very television serial vibe.
 Veeramae ... is the kind of film that has a lame sex joke involving Porus and his girlfriend, whose name could be Malarvizhi, Janaki or Sentamizhselvi. It is the kind of film where a doctor would say, “It is not in our hands” when a character asks if another character would make it till the end credits. It is the kind of film where extras look way scarier than villains. It is the kind of film that shows least empathy towards sexual assault and harassment. Let us not even get started about a social activist and his fight for justice, written as an excuse.
 All of this makes you wonder if Thu Pa Saravanan finished the final draft, tore it in frustration, and decided to go-ahead with the film by pasting together all the random bits of paper. The final product looks scattered, feels scattered.  Veeramae Vaagai Soodum

 The problem is he over-explains the idea, diluting some of the fun of the concept. Perhaps, he underestimates the pace of millennials. So much so that towards the end, a song plays in the background that says it is about the circle of life; the loop as the title suggests. Anyway, the savvy Savitri becomes Savi here and Satyavan is simply Satya. At a time when the Hindi film heroine is breaking every glass ceiling, it is time to retell Savitri’s tale who brought her love from the clutches of death. Here Savitri becomes Savi (Tapsee Pannu) who attempts the impossible for her gambler man, simply named Satya (Tahir Raj Bhasin).  With moody lighting, arresting colour schemes, and pulsating background score, the film begins as an interesting battle between luck and determination, chance and
karma , but as the storytelling gets increasingly self-aware and the main protagonists even more so, the ‘accidents of fate’ lose their charm.
 Recurrence is the inherent limitation of the idea, and also the challenge for the filmmaker to keep you invested in a loop. When the whole exercise begins to look pretentious, one starts looking at the green walls of the washroom, and the pink colour scheme of the worn-off bedroom. We know it is the official adaptation of the German film, we understand that we are following Savi who is running in her sub-conscience, but somehow it doesn’t pass the intrinsic logic of the film and the running part feels gratuitous after a point. Perhaps, the makers wanted to make use of Tapsee’s physique that she built for the sports films that she has been doing. Tapsee gets into the spirit of Savi but, once again, she is a little too earnest. As a result, the emotions remain adsorbed on the surface. Shreya Dhanwanthary shows how to do it in a cameo. Tahir gets the laidback attitude right but with three outings in less than a month, the actor is a little overexposed. The immensely-likable Dibeyendu Bhattacharya — as the crime lord — tries hard to chew the dialogues to generate some interest, but it doesn’t work.

#Alive,  2020), but have also inserted the undead in their period dramas (
Kingdom,  2019).
  However, what makes
All of Us Are Dead  stand out amidst this growing list of K-Zombie content are the central protagonists in the series. The motley crew of survivors are not your gun-slinging, machete-wielding, adept zombie-killing protagonists, these are teenagers who quite literally have to grab the object nearest to them and hastily fashion a weapon out of it.
 This is also where the show finds its sparingly lighter moments. Friends dole out advice on dealing with high school crushes as bloody zombies snarl in the background (!) But beyond these interactions, the series takes a massive departure from the traditional route of keeping a zombie apocalypse setting somewhat comically chaotic. Instead, directors Lee JQ and Kim Nam-su choose not to shy away from tackling the emotional weight of death and mayhem. The best example of this is seen when the show deals with the zombification or “turning” of humans. A shot usually reserved to fulfil the horror quota is turned on its head to play out poignantly heartbreaking scenes. In place of a hastened transformation, we get a drawn-out process, in which the horror stems from the now-undead zombie reconciling with the loss of their humanity, often right in front of their classmates.  All of Us Are Dead The directors do not whiplash the audience back into zombie-infested reality; instead we sit with the students in numbing grief as they lose their friends, classmates and teachers, over and over again. The heavy storyline doesn’t feel misplaced, as writer Chun Sung-il richly fleshes out these teen characters to carry forward the complex tale. Nam On-jo (Park Ji-hu) serves as a narrative protagonist who bands together with her childhood friend Lee Cheong-san (Yoon Chan-young), her crush Lee Su-hyeok (Park Solomon), and the aloof overachieving class President Choi Nam-ra (Cho Yi-hyun) among other classmates to fight zombies and school bullies alike.  Director Lee JQ’s choice to cast actors “unfamiliar to the audience” pays off masterfully.  The makers also ensure that the layered storytelling does not come at the cost of high-adrenaline action scenes, jump scares and well-executed VFX gore. Mirroring the title sequence, the directors slowly descend the audience into a zombie-filled reality, and the series conveys the same visually. What starts off as a brightly-lit, vividly colourful school, eventually transforms into a nauseatingly dull place with the colour saturation dialed back, as the virus spreads. When required, the filmmakers also immerse us into the zombie experience. The cinematography during the zombie-human confrontation scenes moves fast, never quite fixating on a single character, which makes for quite unsettling viewing. It is havoc heightened for the students, as well as the audience watching, as we learn along with them, who survived and who didn’t.  Another unconventional directorial choice comes in the form of how the show is paced out. With 12 episodes, each almost an hour long, the story stretches out the events of each day over multiple episodes. The material to fill this time comes from the pockets of survivors it creates throughout the city.  Though the storyline follows a core group of students trapped in high school, we are also given glimpses of a politician scrambling to escape her office; a social media influencer trying to farm the crisis for viral content; and two police officers, mismatched in their levels of courage, racing to retrieve the antidote. These different dynamics are crafted for the series to also address multiple systemic issues. With the origin of the zombie virus itself rooted in a history of bullying, the school becomes ground zero for the show to explore social class hierarchies.  Additionally, for the senior students of Hyosan High, the zombie apocalypse does not even figure as a priority stressor. With the university entrance exams looming over, Park Mi-jin, a student, laments, “It’s impossible for me to get into college even if I live,” while practicing her zombie killing techniques.  The dynamic between how the State handles this crisis and its effect on students also serves as a microcosm for how authorities react to apocalyptic situations. Unfortunately, this is also where the plot wavers a bit. The series often attempts to pack in too much, as it stretches two separate storylines involving teenage pregnancy and sexual assault across multiple episodes. Not enough time is spent on either narrative to create meaningful conclusions or provide these characters with a kinder, more humane ending. Ultimately, in a genre teeming with Hollywood’s undying need to provide the perfect post-apocalyptic male-hero zombie killer tale, South Korea has bravely put forth a story of survival. Oscillating between the alive and the undead, the show makes an impact by centering the fact that endurance doesn’t always mean strength, sometimes it is born out of repeated acts of kindness.  All of Us Are Dead is currently streaming on Netflix

413,"February 02, 2022",16:24 IST,entertainment,reviews,‘Shane’ documentary review: An intimate portrayal of the man they call ‘Hollywood’,"  In the new documentary film
Shane , there are instances where people known to Shane Warne try to downplay his image or his remarkable talents as a cricketer. Friend and British pop superstar Ed Sheeran calls him, “an everyday bloke who happens to be good at bowling”. Warne’s daughter Brooke affectionately terms him a “dorkey, blokey dad”. And the man himself downplays his “ball of the century” by calling it “a fluke, because I never bowled it again!” (more on that later).

You can subscribe for free here Let’s not kid ourselves. Shane Warne remains anything but a humble bloke. The Australian spin-bowling legend has always been larger than life, on and off the field. He has long been credited with making spin bowling, especially leg-spin bowling, fashionable again from the 1990s following a golden era of fast bowling in the previous decade. 15 years after his international retirement, little has changed. You can still hear the ball “whirr” as he tosses it up for the camera and mesmerises you with his variations and subtle tricks. As a commentator and expert analyst, his forceful views prove to be either pinpoint-accurate or downright flippant, lacking in any basis. That’s Warne for you. Over the course of 90 minutes of film, Warne describes his no-holds-barred brand of aggression and intimidation which he acknowledges may be joyous for some, unpalatable for many. Team-mates and commentators say that Warne was a gamechanger in the way he brought a fast bowler’s brand of aggression into spin bowling. “He had the ability to make the batsman always second guess himself,” says former England captain Andrew Strauss, also Warne’s 700th Test victim. “You were playing the man, and not the ball,” summed up commentator Mark Nicholas. Shane One of the interesting anecdotes from his childhood was how a freak leg injury forced him to use his hands more, which helped develop strong wrists to spin the ball. Like many suburban Australian kids, “footy” (Australian Rules Football) was his first love. But his AFL dreams went up in smoke when he was dropped by St. Kilda Football Club. He admitted he “wasn’t good enough” for the big league and he certainly didn’t fancy delivering beds and pizzas for too long. Footy’s loss was cricket’s gain. The fear of rejection was to shape Warne’s future. After a horrible Test match debut against India, Warne was dropped. Fearing history was repeating itself, he sought help from former Australian spinner Terry Jenner. Warne showed up at Jenner’s estate, music blaring from the stereo, and the latter took one look at the chubby youngster from Melbourne with shoulder-length blonde hair, and said bluntly he had to get fit quickly. Only a year later, the world took notice of Warne when he bowled that “ball of the century” that bamboozled Mike Gatting at Old Trafford in 1993. The film thankfully gives generous airtime to this delivery, described from all angles by players and commentators who witnessed that historic moment. Gatting, in the film, almost feels proud that the flamboyant leg-spinner went on to make history, while inadvertently playing his part in it. For an authorised biography of a celebrity sportsman, the film mentions his various indiscretions and controversies, though it’s a mixed bag. Warne describes in detail his bizarre meeting with Saleem Malik in his hotel room where the Pakistan captain offered him $200,000 to bowl poorly and throw away the 1994 Karachi Test, which he rejected. However, the episode of Warne and Mark Waugh accepting money from an Indian bookie to provide information — and the Australian cricket board’s messy cover-up— is merely glossed over. The most poignant moments in the film are the reflections on his personality and character. His ex-wife Simone Callahan opens up about the pain she and her kids went through when British tabloids laid bare his infidelity just before the 2005 Ashes tour began. She returned to Australia with the kids, and the eldest Brooke chokes when she recollects that period. A melancholic and unusually reclusive Warne felt the rug being pulled under his feet, admitting to raiding the mini-bar in his hotel every night. Crude chants from the Barmy Army England supporters didn’t wreck his game though; he still took 40 wickets that series. The other noteworthy episode is a dining room conversation with his parents and brother recalling the 2003 doping controversy just before the World Cup. Warne’s mum innocently gave him a pill to lose weight, to look “slim as a chick”, which he took unknowingly. It turned out to be a banned diuretic that led to a year-long ban. With the past long behind them, Warne clarifies that he never blamed his mum for it. It was the same kind of stupidity that landed him in the match-fixing scandal in the first place. Warne humbly acknowledges he overstepped the line several times, and “paid the price for it and rightfully so”, dating back to his teens when he was sent home from the academy in Darwin for “mooning” (indecent exposure). Warne’s nickname “Hollywood” seemed to stick through his life. Though nowhere in the film does he explain why he happens to be a repeat offender. The film has some other significant omissions too. The rivalry with Sachin Tendulkar and the nightmares the batsman caused him in the late 90s barely gets a mention. Tendulkar’s presence in the film however brings out a fun incident, when Warne had his mouth on fire after one bite of spicy chicken at Tendulkar’s Mumbai home! The film also highlights Warne’s celebrated Test achievements and comebacks from surgeries and bans, but makes only sporadic mentions of his one-day career. Warne’s repeated transgressions cost him a full-time Australian captaincy, but we never get to hear his views or regrets on missing out on the top job. Meanwhile, Warne’s cricketing acumen and leadership saw merit when he led the unfancied Rajasthan Royals to the IPL title in 2008. That season is truly worth a film on its own.

Reacher , based on the Child’s first novel,
Killing Floor (1997), detailing the adventures of a nomadic ex-MP, has got everything right from the explosive action to the many twists and turns, including a vital clue based on a punctuation mark.

You can subscribe for free here Best of all in Alan Ritchson, there is the perfect Rambo-Rimbaud combination that Jack Reacher signifies... if a little too gym-toned. In an interview with this writer, Child had spoken of the discussions about when to set the show: in the 90s when the book was written, or in the present. The makers finally opted for a timeless look where smartphones and social media are a fact of life, but not the driving force of the show. That has proved a smart decision with Reacher being comfortable around cell phones but not chained to it. So he does not come across as some kind of weird luddite, but rather as someone coolly quirky counting his folding toothbrush, wad of cash and passport as his only possessions. Even the central mystery works like a charm. Reacher A perfect hero—he even punches out a bad man ill-treating a dog (yay), Reacher gets off a bus at Margrave, Georgia, when he remembers his brother Joe telling him about a Blues musician, Blind Blake, who had died there. Reacher is immediately hauled off to jail for murder and when Reacher realises the sleepy town of Margrave is covering a gigantic conspiracy, he gets to work with his wits and fists to clear it all up. While some people including chief of detectives, Finlay (Malcolm Goodwin) and Roscoe (Willa Fitzgerald) believe in his innocence, there are others like Mayor Teale (Bruce McGill) and Kliner Sr (Currie Graham), who seems to have bought the town with all his donations, and his horrible son KJ, (Chris Webster), who do not.  Frances Neagley (Maria Sten), who worked with Reacher in the Army, she was Master Sergeant, now works in the private sector and provides Reacher with crucial information—yes, she does not appear in
Killing Floor , but it makes sense to introduce the series regulars in the first season. Fitzgerald and Sten make for ideal Reacher women—smart, strong and resourceful.
 We also learn of Reacher’s growing up years in bases around the world, and where he learnt to fight dirty, and also that he can eat any amount of junk without getting a heart attack thanks to genetics. He finally gets to eat the peach pie...  Jack Reacher fans, who have followed the ex-military policeman’s adventures over 26 novels will be pleased at the care taken over creating the character. From his need to wander away from the campfire and his theory of aliases, to his habit of binning his clothes rather than do laundry, (that T-shirt was fun and he even wears a suit!) it is all there. That is not to say there is not enough in the show to attract newbies.
Reacher , like the books, is brutally efficient, with an interesting central mystery and character. It definitely has the legs for a long haul.
 Reacher streams on Amazon Prime Video from February 4

Good Luck Sakhi  been a short story in a book, it could have been a young adult fiction that harks back to simpler times, narrating the story of a young woman from a village who dusted off her bad luck tag. As a film, it unravels like a throwback to less complicated narratives of the Hindi cinema of the 1970s. Kukunoor had stated that he wrote the story trying to keep the vibe of Hrishikesh Mukherji. The first hour pretty much exists in such a zone, despite the story being set in a fictitious Rayalaseema village where a Telangana origin Sakhi (Keerthy Suresh) takes centre stage.

baraat  is on the way to Sakhi’s house and a bunch of kids think it is fun to welcome the groom with crackers. Taken aback, the horse goes rogue and leaves the groom with a broken limb. Apparently, he is not the first groom to have suffered as a result of Sakhi’s bad luck. Nobody thinks the firecrackers are a problem! It all unfolds like a Hollywood musical, with Devi Sri Prasad setting the mood with the delightful
 ‘Adigo vastundi bad luck Sakhi…’
Good Luck Sakhi The milieu is charming. Chirantan Das’s cinematography captures the earthiness and the pop of colours. Sakhi is unmindful of her unlucky tag and asserts that she will rewrite her doomed fate. The portions where she meets her childhood friend ‘goli’ Raju aka Ramarao (Aadhi Pinisetty), now a theatre actor, are fun to watch, accentuated with the game of marbles and the village candy seller. The arrival of a former Colonel (Jagapathi Babu) who wants to mentor shooting enthusiasts in the village changes the course of things. These portions are also set in a familiar zone, with humour pervading the narrative until the Colonel finds Sakhi and Suri (Rahul Ramakrishna) to be worthy of mentoring. The unspoken romance between Ramarao and Sakhi, the vicious nature of Suri and the growing confidence of Sakhi, coupled with her admiration and fondness for her guru are the various aspects the story deals with. Keerthy Suresh plays Sakhi with an innocent charm and Jagapathi Babu and Aadhi Pinisetty are adequate in their parts. There are a few good touches. For instance, the scene in which Sakhi speaks up in a panchayat and lets people know what she wants. Elsewhere, she shows that she is capable of defending herself when harassed. But all this does not feel enough as the story progresses. Nothing feels insurmountable in Sakhi’s journey — neither the conflicts that arise due to matters of the heart nor the troublemaker who surreptitiously tries to derail her. The story needed gravitas. It is one thing to show how Sakhi’s razor-sharp focus that helped her in marbles in childhood also coming in handy for shooting. But we never get the feeling that Sakhi truly yearns to be a sportsperson. What does winning mean to her, beyond getting rid of her bad luck tag? We never know. Above all, what made the Colonel open a shooting range in the village even before he knew there would be takers for it?  If the story had more depth, it could have been another
Iqbal  —
 an underdog story of small town aspirations and triumph against all odds. But it falls way short. Kukunoor’s Telugu debut film could have been so much more.

417,"April 08, 2022",20:18 IST,news,national,KAT stays general transfers of higher secondary school teachers," The Kerala Administrative Tribunal (KAT) on Friday stayed the general transfers of higher secondary school teachers in the State.  The Principal Bench of the tribunal led by chairman C.K. Abdul Rehim issued an interim order on the basis of a plea by six English higher secondary school teachers who faulted the transfer proceedings by the General Education department this year.  The petitioners, all of them from Thiruvananthapuram and had applied for transfers to their home station, approached the KAT citing the transfers violated the prescribed norms since they had been finalised without inviting applications from those eligible.  Instead, the department had considered the applications received the previous year. The criteria that had been fixed a year ago was also taken into consideration while preparing the provisional transfer list published on February 15, they claimed.  Last year, the department had invited applications for transfers from those teachers who had completed three years in a station. Its circular had stated that the posts of teachers who had completed five years of service in their home station will be among those that would be treated as open vacancies for transfer. However, the transfers could not be effected for various reasons, including the spread of COVID-19.  The petitioners, who were represented by advocate Fathahudeen M., contended that more teachers would have been eligible to apply had the department invited fresh applications this year. Likewise, more vacancies would have opened up. They also faulted the transfer proceedings to the 34 vacancies that were reported in the capital district. While only four vacancies were reserved for home station transfers, as many as 26 were proposed for priority categories such as compassionate, preferential and retirement transfers.  They claimed the ‘arbitrary’ move would defeat the objective of general transfers to accommodate eligible employees in their home station.  The government informed that the transfer proceedings, which is estimated to involve roughly 5,000 teachers, would be kept on hold until further instructions were issued by the KAT when the case is considered on April 13.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kat-stays-general-transfers-of-higher-secondary-school-teachers/article65303615.ece

420,"April 08, 2022",20:11 IST,news,national,Telangana Health Dept. mulls ban on private practice by govt. doctors," The Telangana Health Department is mulling the possibility of imposing a ban on private practice by government hospital doctors. If a clause to implement it comes into being, it would be effective on those recruited into government service in the coming years. This is in line with the move initiated by the Andhra Pradesh cabinet, which has already decided to ban private practice by government doctors. This is not the first time such a proposal is being mulled. In 1983, the then NT Rama Rao government took a similar decision but was met with resistance.  “Right now, the plan is only in discussion stage,” said a source in the Health department. Meanwhile, doctors said that implementing it would be a tough task as there are thousands of doctors in Telangana. “Who and how will anyone keep track. A doctor might offer service at three private hospitals. Who will go around to check the thousands of doctors? Sufficient incentive need to be offered to government doctors so that they don’t practise at private health facilities,” said a senior doctor. If functional, this would be one of the series of steps being mulled to ensure patients get quality service, without delays, at government health centres.  Other measures being mulled include installing CCTV cameras in PHCs to monitor the work of healthcare workers, and check if doctors are skipping work during duty hours at major hospitals.  The government is also planning GPS tracking system in official vehicles, and taking action against anyone who is part of the referral system to private hospitals. “The pilot project of using cameras to monitor work of HCWs has begun in a few places, and would be extended across the State. Three cameras are placed to monitor the work of the doctor, pharmacist and lab technician. We were told GPS could be installed in official vehicles also,” said a source. However, officials are anticipating resistance to the new move of tracking doctors. “No one will openly object to this. How can somebody oppose efficient medical services at government health centres to serve the poor? But, practically, some of the aspects have to be worked out such as incentives for doing overtime or post duty hours, resources including equipment, medical disposables, and sufficient human resources, among others. If these are not provided, the lapses would remain,” said another source.",K Shiva Shanker,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/telangana-health-dept-mulls-ban-on-private-practice-by-govt-doctors/article65303258.ece
421,"April 08, 2022",20:10 IST,news,national,No one has fundamental or absolute right to receive foreign donations: SC," The Supreme Court on Friday upheld amendments introducing restrictions in the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) while holding that no one has a fundamental or absolute right to receive foreign contributions. In a judgment that may hit non-governmental organisations (NGOs) working at the grass-root level with no direct link to foreign donors, the court reasoned that unbridled inflow of foreign funds may destabilise the sovereignty of the nation. The restrictions involve a bar on using operational FCRA accounts to receive foreign contributions; mandatory production of the Aadhaar card for registration under the FCRA. They require NGOs and recipients to open a new FCRA account at a specified branch of the State Bank of India in New Delhi as a “one-point entry” for foreign donations. The petitioners, including individuals and NGOs engaged in cultural, educational, religious activities, argued that the amendments suffered from the “vice of ambiguity, over-breadth or over-governance” and violated their fundamental rights. They said the new regime amounts to a blanket ban on the capacity of intermediary organisations in India to distribute foreign donations to smaller and less visible NGOs. But the court countered that the amendments only provide a strict regulatory framework to moderate the inflow of foreign funds into the country.  “No one can be heard to claim a vested right to accept foreign donations, much less an absolute right,” a three-judge Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar, who authored the verdict, said. Free and uncontrolled inflow of foreign funds has the potential to impact the socioe-conomic structure and polity of the country. “Philosophically, foreign contribution (donation) is akin to gratifying intoxicant replete with medicinal properties and may work like a nectar. However, it serves as a medicine so long as it is consumed (utilised) moderately and discreetly, for serving the larger cause of humanity. Otherwise, this artifice has the capability of inflicting pain, suffering and turmoil as being caused by the toxic substance (potent tool) — across the nation,” Justice Khanwilkar wrote in a 132-page judgment. The court said charity could be found at home. NGOs could look within the country for donors. “The presence/inflow of foreign contribution in the country ought to be at the minimum level, if not completely eschewed. The influence may manifest in different ways, including in destabilising the social order within the country,” it noted.  Fundamental rights have to give way in larger public interest to the need to insulate the democratic polity from the “adverse influence of foreign contributions”.  “The third-world countries may welcome foreign donations, but it is open to a nation, which is committed and enduring to be self-reliant and variously capable of shouldering its own needs, to opt for a policy of complete prohibition of inflow/acceptance of foreign contribution (donation) from a foreign source,” the court said. Unregulated inflow of foreign donations would only indicate that the government was incapable of looking after its own affairs and needs of its citizens, Justice Khanwilkar observed.  The court noted how 19,000 certificates of registration under the FCRA were cancelled for violating statutory compliances. The annual inflow of foreign contribution had almost doubled between the years 2010 and 2019. There was a spurt of criminal investigations. Donations had been re-routed. Successive transfers and creation of a layered trail of money had made it difficult to trace the flow and final utilisation of foreign donations despite the “firm regime” in place since 2010. “The amendments do not prohibit inflow of foreign contributions, but are a regulatory measure to permit acceptance by registered persons or persons having prior permission to do so with condition that they must themselves utilise the entire contribution,” Justice Khanwilkar observed. The court held that the restrictions in the amendments were “reasonable” and “founded on intelligible criteria”. It fixed accountability on the recipients, increased the efficacy of “continual supervision” over foreign contributions, did not discriminate and served the purpose of the FCRA 2010.  “Mere plea of inconvenience is not enough to attract constitutional inhibition… There is intrinsic evidence to indicate that the change effected by the amendments is to serve the legitimate government purpose and has a rational nexus to the object of the principal Act of 2010,” Justice Khanwilkar observed. However, the court read down one of the provisions — Section 12 (A) — of the 2020 Amendment Act, which mandated the production of Aadhaar card for registration. The Bench allowed the office-bearers of NGOs to use their Indian passports as an identification document.

422,"April 08, 2022",20:10 IST,news,national,Kunnamkulam aims to be carbon-neutral," The Kunnamkulam municipality is on a mission to achieve zero carbon footprint and emulate Meenangadi in Wayanad, the first carbon-neutral grama panchayat in the country. As part of the initiative, the municipality conducted an assessment of the carbon levels in soil and plants. The College of Climate Change and Environmental Sciences under the Kerala Agricultural University conducted the assessment. Carbon neutrality or zero carbon footprint means achieving zero carbon emission to reverse drastic climate changes and patterns. Measuring and controlling emission of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (CO 2); methane (CH 4), nitrous oxide (N 2O), is the first stage of achieving carbon neutrality. “As part of the more than a-year-long study, we visited 777 houses in 37 wards of the municipality. We included petrol pump workers, bus and lorry drivers and farmers in the study to calculate carbon emission in the municipal area,” said P.O. Nameer, Dean, College of Climate Change and Environmental Sciences. According to the study, current carbon emission in Kunnamkulam municipality is 50,278.70 tonne CO 2 eq. While the carbon stock in the area is 35,198.32 tonne CO 2 eq. So the municipality has an excess of 15,080.38 CO 2 eq. They studied carbon emission from sources such as traffic, industry, domestic purposes, waste management, and farming. As per the study, if the municipality wants to achieve carbon neutral status by 2030, it needs to plant at least 38 lakh saplings in its area. Use of solar energy should be encouraged in offices and houses. Electric vehicles and cycles also should be encouraged.  Scientific waste management and continuing awareness programmes on carbon neutrality are some of the suggestions given by the College of Climate Change and Environmental Sciences for achieving the zero emission stage. The college is preparing an action plan to achieve the goal, Mr. Nameer said.",Mini Muringatheri,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kunnamkulam-aims-to-be-carbon-neutral/article65303440.ece

428,"April 08, 2022",19:55 IST,news,national,Shettar’s meeting with Amit Shah attracts political attention," The meeting of senior BJP leader and former Chief Minister Jagadish Shettar with Union Home Minister Amit Shah in Delhi on Thursday night has aroused political curiosity due to the timing of the meeting that took place back on Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai leaving Delhi. The main reason for the political curiosity is that though the Chief Minister was camping in Delhi for two days, he could not meet Mr. Shah. However, Mr. Shettar managed to meet him. Mr. Shettar has said that it was an informal and cordial meeting in which several political issues too were discussed. Sources in the BJP State unit argue that it could be an effort by the party high command to consult party senior leaders ahead of preparing a road map for the 2023 Assembly elections in Karnataka. Referring to the speculation that the party high command is looking at the possibility of either ministerial expansion or reshuffle as well as effecting an organisational rejig, they feel that Mr. Shettar’s meeting could be related to such an exercise. Meanwhile, the ministerial aspirants are disappointed as the high command is yet to give its approval for immediate expansion. The matter is expected to be discussed further when BJP national president J. P. Nadda would arrive in Karnataka to participate in the party State executive to be held in Hosapete on April 16 and 17. This is being seen in BJP circles as a cautious approach by the party high command as it does not want either the disappointed ministerial aspirants or those to be dropped from Ministry to rebel against the party just when elections are less than a year ahead. Also, the proposal for appointing veteran leader B.S. Yediyurappa’s son B.Y. Vijayendra as party’s prominent office-bearer or including him in the Ministry has also made the party high command to tread cautiously in this regard, sources in the party said. Earlier, there were expectations of a ministerial expansion soon after the Chief Minister’s return from his Delhi visit. However, now it turns out that things in this regard may move forward only after the State executive if at all the central leadership wants a ministerial expansion or reshuffle.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/shettars-meeting-with-amit-shah-attracts-political-attention/article65302726.ece

The inhuman treatment of Loknath Dalei, the Nilagiri correspondent of the Odia daily, Sambad, at the Baleshwar District Headquarter Hospital followed his arrest over a ‘minor altercation’ with a home guard after a collision involving their bikes. On April 4, the journalist’s bike collided with the bike of Niranjan Rana, a home guard with the Nilagiri police station. An annoyed Mr. Dalei snatched Mr. Rana’s helmet, saying he would return it only after the damage to his bike was paid for. However, he then returned Mr. Rana’s helmet and left the place. “The home guard had perhaps felt offended and lodged a complaint against me.

I fell unconscious. Subsequently, I was admitted to the Nilagiri hospital and then referred to the Baleshwar district hospital.”  And while he was under treatment for the assault, Mr. Dalei was kept shackled to the hospital bed like a hardened criminal from 7 a.m. to 12 noon on Thursday. On Friday, Mr Dalei was admitted to the intensive care unit after he complained of chest pain, his wife Ms Nirupama said.  The OHRC on Friday observed that shackling Mr. Dalei was a gross violation of his human rights by the police.

Hundred per cent of the reserved trains have resumed services as also more than 90% of the trains passing through the zone these days. This is apart from special trains running on busy routes and augmentation of coaches in high wait-listed trains. Such has been the increasing demand that 127 coaches have been permanently augmented in 82 regular trains, mostly with extra 3 AC and sleeper coaches. ”About 49 3AC coaches were added additionally as against 31 sleeper coaches based on the patronage and demand from the passengers in some trains. Occupancy has been 101% in January, which increased to 119% in February and touched 120% in March.

442,"April 08, 2022",19:39 IST,news,national,Model by-laws soon for agri-credit societies," The Union government is all set to bring in model by-laws to govern around 63,000 Primary Agricultural Credit Society (PACS) across the country. The newly created Ministry of Cooperation is also formulating a national level policy for cooperatives that is likely to be finalised by the end of this year, a senior government official has said. The formation of the Ministry of Cooperation was announced on July 5, 2021 and Home Minister Amit Shah was allocated the portfolio during the Cabinet expansion. Many cash rich cooperatives in several States are controlled by Opposition parties such as the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress and they play a crucial role in political events in States such as Maharashtra, Kerala, Gujarat, parts of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal. The official said on Friday that plan was afoot to expand the role of cooperatives to economic and social spheres also. “India’s demography is changing. Eighty percent of the population in urban areas will be above 60 years of age, their needs are different and presently, they are catered by the private sector. Such services can be rendered by the cooperatives in future,” the official stated. The ministry has planned a two-day National Conference on Cooperation Policy on April 12 and 13. It will be inaugurated by Mr. Shah. More than two dozen Central Ministries represented by Secretaries and Joint Secretaries, all State governments and Union Territories represented by their Chief Secretaries, Additional Chief Secretaries, Principal Secretaries and Registrars of Cooperatives and heads of around 40 cooperative and other major national institutions will participate in the conference. A statement by the Ministry said the conference would explore the “present legal framework, identification of regulatory policy, operational barriers and measures required for their removal, leading to Ease of Doing Business and providing a level playing field to cooperatives and other economic entities.” The conference would discuss ways to promote new cooperatives and revitalise the defunct ones, cooperation among cooperatives, ways to increase membership and measures to address regional imbalance. “We have received 54 suggestions from 20 State governments and other stakeholders, they will be incorporated in the new policy that is being framed,” the official said. The draft of the national database of cooperative societies was being finalised and the digitisation of PACS would be completed soon, he added.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/model-by-laws-soon-for-agri-credit-societies/article65303359.ece
443,"April 08, 2022",19:39 IST,news,national,TS writes to MoJS to refer its Section 3 plea to KWDT-II,"  The Telangana Government has requested the Ministry of Jal Shakti (MoJS) one more time to refer its complaint made under Section 3 of the Inter State River Water Disputes Act, 1956, to the existing Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal-II or Brijesh Kumar Tribunal immediately to finalise the fair and equitable share of Telangana in Krishna waters. In a letter addressed to Secretary of the Department of Water Resources (MoJS) Pankaj Kumar, Special Chief Secretary (Irrigation) of Telangana Rajat Kumar drew the former’s attention to the second Apex Committee meeting held on October 6, 2020 and the categorical decision there to refer Telangana complaint under Section 3 of the ISRWD Act to a tribunal. He stated that Telangana had already communicated to MoJS about withdrawal of its petition in the Supreme Court. On whether the complaint be referred to KWDT-II, which is not dissolved under Section 12 of the ISRWD Act, or to a new tribunal, the Telangana official wrote that it would be appropriate to refer the it to the existing Tribunal. Stating that one of the issues being deliberated in the matter now was whether the reference of the complaint made under Section 3 of the ISRWD Act was necessary when another reference under Section 89 of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014, was pending adjudication before KWDT-II. “There can’t be any ambiguity on it. A clear judicial pronouncement with regard to the scope and ambit of reference under Section 89 of the APRA is spelt out by KWDT-II in its order dated October 19, 2016”, Mr. Rajat Kumar said. He further pointed out that the scope of reference under Section 89 of APRA was limited as observed by KWDT-II in its 2016 order: “Purpose of this provision is also not apparently well ascertainable from Section 89 itself. Maybe that it may have been considered to be helpful in any way at the time of sharing of water of erstwhile AP between two successor States. This may only be a possibility, nothing beyond that”. Mr. Rajat Kumar reiterated that only a complaint under Section 3 of ISRWD Act would ensure equitable allocation of the Krishna river water between AP and Telangana. “There can’t be any legal bar for referring Telangana’s complaint made under Section 3 since the scope and ambit of both (Section 3 and Section 89) the provisions are different. Telangana’s plea can’t be viewed as affecting the rights or interests of upper riparian States (Karnataka and Maharashtra) as it’s only a process of adjudication of the legitimate rights of Telangana”, he explained. Further, he noted that the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) was sharing Krishna water between AP and Telangana on ad-hoc basis, as was being followed in erstwhile AP, stating that revising the shares was not in its purview and only an appropriate tribunal could review it.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ts-writes-to-mojs-to-refer-its-section-3-plea-to-kwdt-ii/article65303403.ece

In a statement, Mr. Naidu questioned the police for not filing an ‘abetment to suicide’ case based on the selfie video where Parthasarathy had reportedly blamed his own party leaders from the YSRCP for resorting to the extreme step.  Mr. Naidu said YSRCP had brought in the toxic culture of selling posts for money in the Kuppam segment. “Parthasarathy belonged to a Backward Caste and became a victim of his own partymen,” he said. Demanding that the police treat the selfie video left behind by the victim as his dying declaration and file a case against those responsible for his death, Mr. Naidu said Parthasarathy had clearly mentioned that his own party colleagues had been harassing him.

A single Bench of Justice P.D. Naik set aside the special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court order against Mr. Wadhawan, which had directed him to be shifted to the State-run JJ Hospital from the privately-run Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital in Mumbai, where he has been lodged for the last 15 months. The court allowed Mr. Wadhawan to undergo nasal surgery at the Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital and said he shall be taken to hospital for carrying out tests on April 12 and 13. The court added that after the schedule for the surgery was fixed, he may be admitted for surgery and post-surgery care for two weeks.  Mr. Wadhawan was arrested by the CBI in 2020 in connection with the Yes Bank case. He was later placed under arrest by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). The special CBI judge had, last month, directed the Superintendent of Taloja Central Jail, to shift Mr. Wadhawan to JJ Hospital. It had also sought an explanation from the Superintendent on how Mr. Wadhawan was shifted to the Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital without its permission. The court had passed the order in response to the CBI’s plea stating that there was no medical emergency to keep Mr. Wadhawan in the private hospital for 15 months. Earlier, another court designated under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), which was hearing a plea in the ED case against Mr. Wadhawan, was told that the private hospital had proposed that Mr. Wadhawan needed to undergo a surgery as he was suffering from severe nasal congestion and had difficulty in breathing. Senior advocate Amit Desai, representing Mr. Wadhawan, had previously submitted that his client was continuously on blood thinners and could not take a nasal test which required him to be off blood thinners for a certain duration, and his right to life and personal liberty should also be considered by the court. However, advocate Hiten Venegaonkar, representing the CBI, had opposed the plea and said that no prejudice had been caused to the petitioner by the special CBI court order as there has been “no break in his medical treatment and there is no change of circumstances”. He added that the agency had requested an assessment of Mr. Wadhawan’s health by a medical board and that the JJ Hospital was well-equipped to conduct a nasal surgery. However, Mr. Wadhawan was avoiding treatment at a State-run hospital, Mr. Venegaonkar said.",Sonam Saigal,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bombay-hc-allows-dfhls-wadhawan-to-have-surgery-in-private-hospital/article65303257.ece
446,"April 08, 2022",19:36 IST,news,national,Human-animal conflcit: Minister promises solution,"    Minister for Forests Umesh Katti held discussions with the local community and stakeholders in Madikeri on Friday and promised resolution of human-animal conflict plaguing the region.  The Minister said the Government had sanctioned ₹100 crore this year to erect barricades along the forest boundary to prevent wild animals, especially elephants, from straying into villages.  Additional funds will be sought from the Centre and steps will be taken to increase compensation of ₹7.5 lakh paid to the family members of the victims killed in elephant or tiger attack.  Responding to the public outcry, Mr.Umesh Katti said forest department staff will be directed to be more empathetic with the victims of human-animal conflict and respond to their grievances at the ground level.  The Minister admitted that conflict was high in the region and as many as 5 deaths were reported from Kodagu in recent times alone and barricading was one of the solutions to mitigage the conflict to a large extent.  The Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife), Vijaykumar Gogi, said the Government was sanctioning ₹50 crore each year to take up barricading and this year the amount has been doubled to ₹100 crore. At the current rate of allocation, the barricading exercise can be completed within the next 6 to 7 years and will help reduce conflcit by 90 per cent.  Sherry Subbaiah of Kodagu District Growers Federation called for increased efforts and measures to mititage conflict situations including a special task force for the purpsoe and wanted special focus on Nagarahole and Brahmagiri region. Others present in the meeting drew attention of the Minister to their daily predicament and said they were hesitant to venture out and work in their fields fearing attack from elephants and tigers.  A section of the farmers waned the Forest Department to eschew the growth of nilgiri and teak and instead focus on plants and trees that are fodder to the animals so as to prevent them from straying out of their natural habitat.  Opinions were also expressed that steps should be taken to incrase bamboo coverage in the forest area and maintain elephant-proof trenches along the forest boundary to minimise conflicts.  Mr. Umesh Katti also visited the family memebrs of Ganesh of Gaddemane who was killed in a tiger attack recently and expressed his sorrow over the developments. He also handed over a cheque for ₹5.50 lakh to the wife of the victim as compensation. The Minister also said that social security benefits of the Government would be ensured to the family members of Ganesh.

448,"April 08, 2022",19:35 IST,news,national,Infection squeezes life out of Marayur’s sandalwood trees," Sandalwood spike disease (SSD) is fast killing sandalwood trees in Marayur, the largest natural sandalwood reserve in the world. Currently, 1,000-odd infected trees have dried up in the reserve. The disease, caused by bacterial parasites and transmitted by insects, had resulted in massive loss of sandalwood in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, which along with Kerala contribute nearly 90% of sandalwood in the country.  M.G. Vinodkumar, Divisional Forest Officer, Marayur Sandalwood Division, told The Hindu that SSD mainly affected Reserve Number 52 and 54 near to the Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary. He said it was first identified at Reserve Number 51 nearly 20 years ago. There are no sandalwood trees in the area now. Whether the bacteria is water-borne, air-borne or through other mediums like earth is not known, he said. The sandalwood trees dry up once affected with SSD. Leaves turn thin and yellow and no new leaves will sprout. Within four years, the tree dies. It is feared that the newly grown sandalwood trees could also be affected by SSD in slow phases.  Marayur Sandalwood Division has nearly 57,000 sandalwood trees and it is considered the best one in the country in terms of quality of sandalwood oil.  Mr. Vinodkumar said seeds are collected from only the healthy trees to develop saplings so as to prevent possible disease in future.  The SSD was first identified in Kodagu in 1899 and it was the main reason for large-scale felling of sandalwood trees in Kodagu and Mysuru till 1916. The disease also caused widespread loss of sandalwood trees in Tamil Nadu, one of the reasons for the State-supported felling of sandalwood there. Earlier studies said that 1% to 5% of sandalwood trees are lost every year in the country due to SSD. A study conducted in the Marayur Sandalwood Division by a team of scientists led by R. Sundar Raj of the Bengaluru-based Institute of Woods Science and Technology in 2017 found SSD to be a major threat to the sandalwood reserve. Dr. Sundar Raj told The Hindu that he would visit the Marayur Sandalwood Division in May as a follow-up to the earlier survey. He said a remedy for SSD was yet to be discovered and experiments were on. Scientists of the Kerala Forest Research Institute (KFRI) had also conducted research in the Marayur Forest Division in connection with SSD.",Giji K.

Forest Minister A.K. Saseendran, who convened a meeting of people’s representatives and senior Forest officials here on Friday, also assured local bodies to urge the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) to review its draft notification by incorporating the revised proposals that were submitted last year.  According to him, the State government had excluded human habitations completely from its recommendations in 2021. While the draft notification has proposed to bring an area of 71.27 sq.km under the ESZ, the State had demanded that the extent be confined to 52.036 sq.km. This would limit the zone to those parts of the Amboori, Kallikkad, Vithura and Kuttichal grama panchayat that remained unoccupied. Besides, the tribal communities in these regions would be provided priority.  “While the MoEFCC received the revised proposal, it has evidently ignored the recommendations while preparing the draft notification. The State government will bring the issue to the notice of the Centre,” Mr. Saseendran said.  He assured the leaders of the civic bodies that the final notification would be issued only after addressing the concerns of the local populace. Amboori and Kallikkad grama panchayats had held hartals in protest against the provisions of the draft notification during the last few days.  The Minister also flagged the misinterpretation of the buffer zone of the protected areas that has paved the way for confusion among various sections. Wildlife sanctuaries are generally divided into core zone, buffer zone, and tourism zone for administrative purposes. While these areas come within the protected areas, the ESZ are designated in areas outside their periphery. He, however, pointed out that some tribal settlements were often found in buffer zones.

454,"April 08, 2022",19:29 IST,news,national,Tourism property owners weighed down by debts,"  The impact of COVID-19 coupled with the loan recovery measures initiated by financial institutions by invoking the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securities Interest (SARFAESI) Act have cast a cloud over the lives of hundreds of resort, hotel, and homestay owners in the State.  K.G. Rajesh, 52, a coffee planter at Meppadi, took a farm loan of ₹15 lakh from the Kalpetta branch of the former State Bank of Travancore in 2005 by mortgaging 6.5 acres of land to enter into the hospitality sector by converting his house to a six-room home stay. The business flourished. The planter closed the loan and borrowed ₹35.5 lakh in March 2016 to expand the property. A considerable increase in the inflow of tourists, especially from the U.K., and Germany, was a major motivation. However, he has not been to repay the debts since 2018 once the inflow of tourists came to a halt owing to the recurring incidences of deluge and a Nipah virus outbreak in the adjacent district of Kozhikode.  The government announced moratoriums in 2018 and 2019 on loans due to floods and again in 2020 and 2021 following the outbreak of COVID-19. However, the bank authorities informed him a few months ago that his loan had become a non-performing asset in January 2022 as he was not able to repay on time. “A few weeks ago the bank authorities told me that if I did not pay ₹61.4 lakh, including penal interest, they would take over my property invoking (SARFAESI) Act,” he said. Recently the officials of the asset recovery management branch of the SBI stuck a notice on the property, which reads that the bank authorities have taken its possession following his failure to repay the debt. “I don’t know how to repay the amount as I have not received any serious enquiries from tourists for the past five years,” Mr. Rajesh said, adding that he was also forced to spend a large amount for the maintenance of his property.  More than 30% of the hospitality firms in Wayanad are yet to take off after the pandemic, C.P. Shylesh, secretary, Wayanad Tourism Organisation said. Though many owners are trying to sell their property to repay their debts, there are not many takers due to the uncertainties in the industry and land-related issues in Wayanad , Mr. Shylesh added. “The plight of 80% of the property owners in the tourism industry is almost similar,” V. Sajeev Kurup, general secretary, Confederation of Kerala Tourism Industry, a consortium of 32 tourism-related associations in the State, told The Hindu.  “If a financial institution initiates takeover of a property invoking SARFAESI Act, the property owner has no choice, except to repay the debt or give up the property. As per norms, a borrower cannot challenge the financial institution’s move in a court and can only approach the newly opened Revenue Recovery Tribunal bench in Ernakulum. There, because of dearth of staff, the grievance will be heard only after a long time,” Mr. Kuruppu said.  “Things are looking up and we are organising programmes, including roadshows, to promote tourism, but we need time to repay debts,” he said .  “What we need is quick intervention by the government to halt revenue recovery measures till next March,” Mr. Kurup said.

The second phase will cover targeted public distribution system and other welfare schemes in all 291 aspirational districts as well as districts with high burden of stunting by March 2023. In the final phase the remaining districts of the country will be covered by March 2024.

459,"April 08, 2022",19:15 IST,news,national,Andhra Pradesh: 9th century temple spruced up for Rama Navami festival," Having missed the splendour of the Rama Navami Brahmotsavams due to the COVID-19 pandemic for two consecutive years in 2020 and 2021, people of Valmikipuram town are now eagerly awaiting the ‘Sitarama Kalyanotsavam’ scheduled on Monday night. The annual brahmotsavams of the 9th century Sri Pattabhirama Swamy temple are currently in full swing, with processions being arranged for the temple deities on various 'vahanas' (vehicles) on the temple streets.  Located on the busy Tirupati-Madanapalle highway, the mandal headquarters draws its very existence from the name of sage Valmiki. The temple’s recorded history dates back to a millennium ago. Rama Navami is a household festival here. Residents of the town are known to not allow their visitors from elsewhere leave without first having a darshan of the deity at the temple. Interestingly, the temple happens to be the only one with idols of Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata, Shatrughna, and Sita Devi presented as a cluster in the sanctum sanctorum. The temple, which came under the ambit of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) a few years ago, was witness to the royal visits of Chhatrapati Shivaji, Krishnadevaraya, and several Vijayanagara kings. Inscriptions and temple records also refer to the visits of saint-poet Tallapaka Annamacharya and many British officers. The temple’s glory is also mentioned in one of the sankeerthanas of Annamayya.  Immediately after the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh in 2014, the people of Valmikipuram undertook a vibrant campaign to win the ‘State temple’ status for the Sri Pattabhirama Swamy Temple in order to celebrate Rama Navami on the lines of Bhadrachalam, but lost to Vontimitta of Kadapa district. Local elders said that the ensuing Rama Navami, Kalyanotsavam, and Rathothsavam are major events which are celebrated with gaiety in the town. After a two-year gap in festivities due to the COVID-19 pandemic, they are now expecting a huge congregation of devotees this year.",K.

Justice N. Anand Venkatesh ordered that the training programmes, spanning over six to eight weeks, could be conducted with the assistance of non-governmental organisations working for the LGBTQIA+ community, medical professionals and persons belonging to the community. Since the summer vacation was due for the educational institutions, he said, the programmes could be started forthwith. The directions were issued on a writ petition in which the judge had been issuing a series of directions to the Centre as well as the State government to ensure that the community gets relieved of social prejudices and to ensure that it gets the dignity it deserves. A lesbian couple from Madurai had filed the petition, through their counsel S. Manuraj, alleging harassment by their parents through the police. During the course of hearing on Friday, the judge told Additional Advocate General S. Silambanan that children who undergo biological changes hesitate to disclose it to their parents because of fear of being reprimanded or abandoned. They sometimes confide it to their friends but if the latter turns out to be a pervert, he starts exploiting the child and life becomes hell for them due to the physical and mental trauma. “Many commit suicides because of this but these reasons do not get reported. Therefore, it is essential that the State creates a mechanism for students to get the support they require. There should be at least one person in schools to whom the children can confide in. Otherwise, a child will have no protection at all. If these suicides can be prevented, it will be a great start towards their social integration,” the judge said. Earlier, the judge recorded the submission of Tamil Nadu State Legal Services Authority (TNSLSA) that it had conducted a similar six-week training programme for 96 advocates by selecting three advocates from each district. TNSLSA counsel C.K. Chandrasekhar said this was the first of its kind programme conducted in the country and that the 96 advocates would now serve as resource persons to educate others on problems faced by the transgender.

Jagan Mohan Reddy would give priority to the community in the ensuing Cabinet reshuffle.  After Kapu community, Koppula Velama community has a significant population in the north Andhra region. The community which has around 20 lakh population plays a vital role in the elections. Its support is essential for victory for any party in elections, according to political analysts. Peddinti Jaganmohana Rao, Kolla Appala Naidu, Bandaru Satyanarayana, Chintakayala Ayyannapatrudu and other leaders used to get Cabinet berths in previous governments. However, their importance has gradually come down in Andhra Pradesh politics particularly after the bifurcation of the State in 2014.  Currently, the community has five YSRCP legislators,  including Sambangi Venkata China Appala Naidu (Bobbili), Kadubandri Srinivasa Rao (S.Kota), Budi Mutyalanaidu (Madugula), Annamreddy Adeep Raju (Pendurthi) and P. Ganesh (Narsipatnam).  Among them, Mr. Appala Naidu is the seniormost legislator and got elected to Assembly four times. Budi Mutyalanaidu got elected twice for Assembly and remaining three persons were elected for the first time to the Assembly in 2019 general elections. Among those five legislators, none could get an opportunity to work as the Minister in Jagan’s Cabinet. Now, the community has stepped up pressure on the Chief Minister to get representation in the Cabinet reshuffle scheduled on April 11. Andhra Pradesh Koppula Velama Association’s State president Gottapu Chinnam Naidu, who interacted with community leaders in Vizianagaram, said that it was high time the community get political respect and recognition. “At least one Minister post has to be given to the legislators of Koppula Velama community which is playing a vital role in 35 Assembly constituencies. Although the community does not get many MLA seats, its role and support help candidates win elections in East and West Godavari districts too,” said Mr. Chinnam Naidu.  Meanwhile, Sambangi China Venkata Appala Naidu’s followers are eagerly waiting for positive news from the CMO’s office. “Mr. Appala Naidu was elected to Assembly in 1983 itself. He could defeat TDP’s heavy weight and Bobbili Raja Sujay Krishna Ranga Rao in 2019 elections. Considering his age, political seniority and clean image, he should be given an opportunity to become Minister in Jagan’s cabinet,” said M. Ramesh, a local YSRCP leader. Supporters of S.Kota MLA Kadubandi Srinivasa Rao are also hopeful that he would be given a chance since Mr. Jagan provided an opportunity for the first-time MLAs in his Cabinet.

466,"April 08, 2022",19:03 IST,news,national,Centre asks Kerala to acquire more land for runway expansion at Calicut airport,"  The Union Ministry of Civil Aviation has suggested that the State government acquire 45 acres of land additionally as a long-term measure to increase the length of the tabletop runway at Calicut International Airport from 2,700 m to 3,400 m. The development comes close on the heels of the government moving apace with plans to acquire 18.5 acres of land for reconstructing of the Runway End Safety Area (RESA) at the airport. The current proposal to acquire 11 acres on the western side of the runway (Runway 10) and 7.5 acres on the eastern side (Runway 28) will enable the Airports Authority of India (AAI) to utilise the full length of the airport’s 2,860-m runway. At present, the runway length is 2,700m. M.K. Raghavan, Kozhikode MP, who met Union Minister of Civil Aviation Jyotiraditya Scindia in Delhi has proposed that the length of the runway could be increased if the State government additionally acquired 45 acres of land to avoid recurring land acquisition proceedings for the future development of the Calicut airport. Mr. Raghavan said the AAI already had in its possession 19.464 acres of land with a length of 721 m and width of 108 m on the eastern side at the airport. Thus the length of the runway could be increased from the proposed 2,860 m to 3,400 m by acquiring 45 acres of land, he said. Sources said that the Directorate General of Civil Aviation would take a decision on the issue of giving its approval to resume the operation of wide-bodied aircraft at the Calicut airport only after the completion of RESA works. The acquisition of 18.5 acres of land for this purpose was expected to be completed this fiscal. The AAI had initiated the process for executing the RESA expansion activities, they said. Initially, the Calicut airport was certified for Aerodrome Reference Code 4D as per the International Civil Aviation Organisation. However, operations of wide- bodied were taking place from 2002. But the services of big aircraft were halted in May 2015 due to extensive damage to the runway surface at the airport as well as a recommendation by the court of inquiry that looked into the Air India Express accident at the Mangalore airport. The operation of wide-bodied aircraft was resumed after the runway strengthening and re-carpeting work in 2017. It was suspended again after the Air India Express flight crash at the airport on August 7, 2020.

The Telangana government is to stage a dharna in Delhi on April 11 to protest against the Centre’s alleged discriminatory paddy procurement policy. The entire Telangana Cabinet, MPs and legislators will sit on a day-long protest. The Centre has refused to procure paddy from Telangana this Rabi season, reiterating its stand that it would purchase only raw rice and not parboiled rice, which the majority of the State produces this season.  Mr. Tagore said the protest by the Telangana government in Delhi was merely an eyewash. “Both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR) are doing politics over the issue. They are shifting the blame on each other and it is the farmer who is at the receiving end,” he stated. The Congress government in Chhattisgarh, Mr. Tagore, pointed out, bought the produce from farmers. “The farmer has invested at least ₹15000 an acre. Thanks to the TRS and the BJP’s insensitivity, their produce will be thrown on the roads. Didn’t the KCR government know about the Centre’s procurement policy? Why is it now staging this drama?” Mr. Tagore said that instead of spending money on vanity projects and publicity, the Telangana government should buy the produce directly from farmers. “It will cost the State exchequer close to ₹10,000 crore. Instead of doing this drama, the State government should simply buy the entire produce,” he observed. The State will go to the polls in December 2023. The Congress currently holds 19 seats in the 119-member Assembly.  Assured MSP (minimum support price) and buying the produce would be part of the Congress’s manifesto in the election. The dharna in Delhi was also aimed at Mr. Rao’s efforts to build a national profile for himself, Mr. Tagore added.  In the last few months, Mr. Rao has met several Opposition leaders, including his Tamil Nadu counterpart M.K. Stalin and NCP (Nationalist Congress Party) patriarch Sharad Pawar.

These instruments will enable students to detect and measure radiation and handle radioisotopes safely. The instruments include a Geiger Muller counter for the measurement of Beta radiation and a Gamma Scintillation Detector to measure Gamma radiation.  The BARC scientists were at GITAM Hyderabad to deliver a five-day national workshop on “Radiochemistry and Application of Radioisotopes” for 45 GITAM School of Science faculty members and 20 professors from other universities around the country. Principal, School of Science, GITAM, G.A. Rama Rao, a retired scientific officer from BARC, thanked the centre for gifting such important equipment to GITAM.  “This will help us hold practical training sessions for our radiochemistry students to measure Beta and Gamma radiation. Nuclear energy is a vital option for India to meet the ever-increasing demand for power. Though the subject is introduced to students from 10th standard onwards in schools, the teachers themselves, whether at school, college or university, hardly have any hands-on experience of radioactivity. This five-day workshop by IANCAS at our Hyderabad campus provided an opportunity for the participants to experience handling radioisotopes and detecting and measuring radiation in a real-world setting,” he said.  The BARC scientists used the instruments to demonstrate to the participants that daily use of products such as soap and salt contain enough naturally occurring K-40 radioisotopes to emit Beta radiation. They said that the air we breathe also includes Beta radiation in the form of Radon gas and demonstrated by collecting air samples from the classroom.  The BARC experts taught the basics of radioactivity, decay, radiation, detection and measurement, as well as the application of radioisotopes in areas like chemical sciences, physics, medicine, industry and agriculture. Lab experiments were conducted using radioisotopes like Cobalt-60, Cobalt-67, Thallium-204, Potassium-40 and Cesium-137.  Dr. S.

While Parthasarathy ended his life by jumping before a train on the outskirts of Kuppam on Thursday morning, a video of him blaming “three scribes” and “one person” for his extreme step appeared late at night, and went viral, leading to a tense atmosphere. Parthasarathy was appointed the chairman of the temple before the COVID pandemic. The temple trust board could not celebrate the jatara in the last two years. Now that the pandemic’s threat was over, the trust board embarked on arrangements to celebrate the event on a grand scale.  However, in a swift move, Parthasarathy was dropped and a new chairman was nominated to the board. Seemingly hurt by the development, the outgoing chairman allegedly took the extreme step while the swearing-in ceremony was going on.  The Government Railway Police at Kuppam registered a case and handed over the body to the family members on Friday. In the video, Mr. Parthasarathy said that he had to spend ₹15 lakh for getting the post of temple chairman, and another ₹20 lakh for giving a facelift to the temple. He said he had requested senior party leaders to retain him till the “jatara” of 2022, but in vain.  In his last words, he reportedly referred to the title “Peddayana” (which is generally used for the YSRCP’s strongman in the erstwhile Chittoor district), and said that no one had helped him. He claimed that he was in a rundown state as he had to pay huge interest for the debts he had incurred so far.  The episode led to a protest from members of the Valmiki community, to which Mr. Parthasartahy belonged, from Kuppam and the surrounding regions.  Expecting a law and order problem, additional police forces were deployed in Kuppam from Palamaner and Chittoor. “Four circle-inspectors took up the bandobast duties in Kuppam with additional forces. As of now, the situation is under control,” a senior police officer said. The Kuppam circle inspector said that at present the case was with the GRP police. “An assurance was given to the family members that steps would be taken to register criminal cases under IPC Section 306 against the persons named by the victim,” he said.  Chittoor MP N. Reddappa rushed to Kuppam and paid tributes to Mr. Parthasarathy, and took part in the funeral, besides announcing an ex gratia of ₹10 lakh to his kin. Meanwhile, the development is largely seen as a big turning point in Kuppam politics. A section of the ruling party cadres deplored that Parthasarathy’s suicide had exposed the monopolised politics in the region and the hardships of cadres vying for prominence, spending huge amounts for getting party and nominated posts, and ending up in tragedy.  “We feel sorry for him as he was with us before joining the YSRCP. Now, the people of Kuppam will realise the ‘use and throw’ politics of the ruling party leaders,” said a senior TDP leader in Kuppam.",K.

Indrakaran Reddy has condemned the reported remarks of Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan made after meeting Union Home Minister Amit Shah in New Delhi on Thursday on the State Government and on dissolving the State Assembly. Speaking at Nirmal on Friday, Mr. Indrakaran Reddy said the Governor’s comments that the Telangana Legislative Assembly would have been dissolved had she wished were made beyond her purview and forgetting history. He also refuted the Governor’s allegation that protocol was not being followed by the State Government in her case.  Suggesting that such comments from persons holding gubernatorial posts was highly uncalled for, he recalled the revolt by people after dismissing the N.T. Rama Rao Government in August 1984 by the then Governor of Andhra Pradesh Thakur Ram Lal. However, bowing to the public outrage Rama Rao was reinstalled as Chief Minister a month later, Mr. Indrakaran Reddy recollected. Recollecting the State Government’s cordial relations with Dr. Soundararajan’s predecessor E.S.L. Narasimhan, the Minister said Mr. Narasimhan used to give suggestions to the State Government on several issues. However, the incumbent still appears to be in the mood of State BJP president of Tamil Nadu and was acting as a BJP leader by acting in support of that party in Telangana in her capacity as Governor.  On the protocol issue, the Minister said information on the Governor’s visit to Yadadri was given to the State Government only 20 minutes before her departure by the Raj Bhavan authorities and in such a short time all possible arrangements were made and the Chairman of Yadadri Temple Development Authority had welcomed her at the temple. In regular procedure, information about the visit of Governor to any place in the State would be given to the State Government at least a day in advance, he said.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/law-minister-condemns-governors-comments/article65303082.ece

The order was passed by Special CBI judge Santosh Snehi Mann who directed Mr. Patel to not leave the country without the court’s permission. The next date of the hearing has been posted to April 14 and a response has been sought from Mr. Patel by the court. Staying the direction passed on Thursday by Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Pawan Kumar, the Special CBI judge orally noted: “There has to be a reasonable time to a party, who feels that the order isn’t favourable to approach the authority. The remedy is there”. The court further observed that it was necessary that due opportunity be given to the CBI to file a formal response in the matter. “In the meantime, it is necessary that the cause is not frustrated,” the order observed. During the course of the proceedings, Advocate Nikhil Goel argued that just because one had not been arrested, it could not be said that no LOC could be issued against them as it was “against the basic purpose of issuing an LOC”. “We are dealing with a situation where there is a gap between the end of investigation and beginning of proceedings before the court,” he submitted. CBI’s counsel further argued that the agency’s investigation was not biased and that they (CBI) had been fair in its probe. “Court has not even applied mind, proceedings before court have not begun, that stage has not come,” he stated. Mr. Patel tried to leave the country twice without giving the agency any opportunity to approach the court, he noted.  However, advocate Tanvir Ahmed Mir, appearing for Mr. Patel, argued that the investigating officer was well aware that Mr. Patel had to leave for the U.S. by midnight and the court’s order clearly stated that the CBI should inform the immigration authorities about the same. In a separate case, Mr. Patel filed a contempt plea before Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Dharmender Singh over non-compliance of the order directing the CBI to withdraw the LOC against him. The court has issued notice to the CBI in the matter and it will be heard on April 13. On April 6, Mr. Patel was stopped by the immigration authorities at the Bangalore International Airport while boarding a U.S.-bound flight, citing the LOC issued by the CBI against Amnesty International India in an FCRA case. The court earlier noted that there cannot be any unfettered control or restriction on the right to travel and that the CBI Director should issue Mr. Patel a written apology.",The Hindu Bureau,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/court-stays-order-withdrawing-cbi-look-out-circular-against-aakar-patel/article65303157.ece

District coordinator of SSK A.K. Abdul Hakeem said that Kerala was the first State to implement such a project, which would enable school students to have a deeper knowledge of weather conditions as climate change. “At a time when we experience continuous flooding, for which climate change is responsible to an extent, it is necessary for our kids to know the phenomenon better”, Mr. Hakeem said. The weather stations, being set up at a total cost of ₹10 lakhs in 18 government schools that have geography as an optional subject, will have 13 pieces of equipment, including rain gauge, wind wave, thermometer, monitor, and weather data bank. The students will be able to observe the measure of rain, speed of the wind and atmospheric temperature and to record it scientifically.

482,"April 08, 2022",18:22 IST,news,national,Second powerhouse for Sabarigiri project," After announcing its plans for a second power station for the Idukki hydroelectric project, the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) is pursuing a similar scheme for the Sabarigiri hydel project in Pathanamthitta district. On the cards is an additional powerhouse at Moozhiyar with an installed capacity of ''at least 200 MW,'' says a KSEB official. The director board of the State-run power utility has cleared a proposal to entrust WAPCOS Ltd., the consultancy firm under the Union Ministry of Jal Shakti, with the preparation of the feasibility study report and detailed project report (DPR) for the Sabarigiri extension scheme.  Kerala's second biggest hydel project, the 340-MW Sabarigiri project was commissioned in the late 1960s. It has an installed capacity of 340 MW, but age-related problems plague the powerhouse situated at Moozhiyar. On April 1, the KSEB was forced to shut down one of the six generators at the station after it tripped due to a stator winding failure. Another unit has been down for over a year owing to technical glitches. The additional powerhouse is planned in the vicinity of the existing facility. The project does not require a new reservoir, but will have a separate tunnel and penstock system to draw water, KSEB chairman and managing director B. Ashok said. The Sabarigiri hydel project draws water from the Kakki and Pampa reservoirs. An additional power house will enable the KSEB to increase in-house hydroelectric generation, thus reducing the expenditure on peak-hour power purchases, according to the Capital Investment Plan for 2022-23 filed by the KSEB before the Kerala State Electricity Regulatory Commission. It will further reduce the burden on the existing power station and help meet the morning and evening peak-hour power demand. Since no additional reservoir is required, environmental issues are lesser and hence obtaining statutory clearances will be a relatively easier task, according to the KSEB. For the Idukki hydel project, the KSEB has already announced plans for a new 800-MW power station at Moolamattom to complement the existing 780-MW power generation facility. WAPCOS is also carrying out studies for the Idukki Golden Jubilee Extension Scheme, which is estimated to cost ₹2,669.67 crore. As environmental concerns prevent implementation of big hydel projects, enhancing the capacity of existing storage hydro power facilities is seen as an alternative by the KSEB.",Tiki Rajwi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/second-power-house-for-sabarigiri-project/article65303059.ece

He urged Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai to have the video checked for authenticity by sending it to the forensic laboratory.  He also criticised the BJP Government for provoking fringe groups to take up a campaign against Muslims in the State by taking up one issue after another, the latest being the opposition to Muslims sculpting idols of Hindu deities.

487,"April 08, 2022",18:10 IST,news,national,Kozhikode farmers demand realignment of buffer zone around Malabar Wildlife Sanctuary," In the wake of the Kerala High Court order that extended the deadline for filing objections related to the draft notification on buffer zone around the Malabar Wildlife Sanctuary, various farmers’ organisations in Kozhikode district are preparing to launch a series of campaigns and protests to make people aware about the alleged flaws in finalising boundaries for the proposed buffer zone. The Chakkittapara grama panchayat is likely to emerge as the centre of protest as the majority of affected residents are from there. One of the major issues raised by the farmers’ organisations is the “faulty geo-coordinates” used to fix the boundaries for the buffer zone. They said no scientific study or field survey was done to properly measure the protective zone around the sanctuary. According to them, the available geo-spatial data on Google Maps is the sole source of the existing boundary and it is hardly reliable. “The majority of the landholders are not yet aware of the unscientific measures used for fixing the buffer zone boundaries. We have reasons to believe that all the existing boundary details were prepared in an amateur way by a few officers without visiting the spots,” said Joy Kannanchira, chairman of ‘We Farm’, who approached the court for the extension of the deadline for filing objections.  Functionaries of various farmers’ organisations such as Indian Farmers Movement and Karshaka Raksha Samithi pointed out that the buffer zone regulations, if implemented without proper amendments, would affect the lives of people in 13 villages in Kozhikode and Wayanad districts. Residents in Chembanoda, Chakkittapara, Changaroth, Perambra, Koorachundu, Kanthalad, Puthuppadi, Kattippara, Kedavoor, Thariyod, Pozhuthana, Achooranam and Kunnathinadu villages would primarily face the impact of the proposal, they claimed.  The farmers’ organisations said it was an attempt at massive evacuation and acquisition of farmland for forest conservation. A concerted effort is under way to ensure the support of church authorities, political parties and social movements for the farmers’ agitation. The main demand of the agitators is that the buffer zone proposal should be withdrawn and the sanctuary must be conserved by creating a clear boundary within the forestland alone.   “Whatever be the plan of the government, we will fight by all means to prevent the implementation of a wrong plan. Farmers are willing to join massive street protests for the cause,” said Mr. Kannanchira, one of the State-level coordinators of the upcoming campaign. He said the geo-coordinates for defining the boundaries would not be accepted without conducting a fresh field-level assessment.",A.

Jagan Mohan Reddy on Friday hit out at Telugu Desam Party (TDP) national president N. Chandrababu Naidu for allowing his MPs to “twist” facts related to Andhra Pradesh and malign the image of the State in Parliament. He advised the TDP chief to cooperate with the ruling party like the Opposition parties in other States do for the development of their State. Urging people to continue their unstinted belief in his capability to protect the interests of the State and their welfare, Mr. Jagan reminded people of his promise as an Opposition leader way back in 2017 to create 13 new districts when he came to power. His speech was preceded by a short video clipping of the 2017 Nandyal byelection campaign from the SPG Grounds in the town. Referring to the promise, Mr. Jagan said: “Unlike Mr. Naidu, who failed to keep most of his electoral promises, I am here to tell you that I have kept my word.”  Releasing ₹1,024 crore as the second tranche of the Jagananna Vasathi Deevena financial assistance (boarding and lodging charges) to 10,68,150 students, the Chief Minister detailed the reforms that were undertaken in three years, which had resulted in an 8.64% increase in the Gross Enrolment Ratio for the higher studies and migration of seven lakh schoolchildren from private schools to government schools.  During the TDP rule in 2018-19, the GER was 32.4%, which jumped to 41.04% in 2019-20 and dropouts in schools were reduced with enrolment increasing from 37 lakh to 44.30 lakh, he said. Addressing mothers of children who got Jagananna Vasathi Deevena benefits, he said: “I am here as your elder brother, who will take care of studies of your children and not limited to one per family.”  Mr. Jagan said the government had been continuously improving the school environment through Nadu-Nedu and Gorumudda schemes to ensure good health and education in addition to introducing bilingual textbooks for students to learn English. At  the college level, he said the focus was on skill development through a tie-up with Microsoft, and an internship was made compulsory. The TDP government had not paid ₹1,780 crore of fee reimbursement amount, which the present government had to clear, he pointed out, while dishing out figures on how much was spent in the last three years on education.

The summoning of the five was a direct indictment of the Chief Minister, RPP leaders said. Joel Naga and Vitho Zao, the party’s leaders said two of the five individuals summoned to appear before the ED in Guwahati have Central Bureau of Investigation cases pending against them since 2019. Also among the five is Kuovesieo Rio, appointed in the Chief Minister’s Office as the personal assistant to Mr Rio. The other four are believed to be close confidants of the CM, the RPP said.  “This is nothing less than a direct indictment of the CM himself. Interestingly, all the summoned persons — Kuovisieo Rio, Mengutuo Rio, Dsesevi Pielie, Vibeilietuo Kets and Mhalelie Rio — have given their addresses as Sovima village, Dimapur,” the party said in a statement. “It’s incumbent upon the CM to clear the air regarding the money laundering case. The ED summons letter was issued on February 24 of this year but the deafening silence of the CM and the CMO in this matter till now is a story in itself,” the RPP said.  The party asked the CM to publicly address the issue to put all speculation to rest. The five persons had approached the Kohima bench of the Gauhati High Court with a plea to declare the money laundering case filed against them as “void, non-operative” but the court rejected their plea.  The RPP requested the ED to pursue the case to its logical conclusion based on available facts.  “This summon is a first in the history of the State and the harried general public reeling under blatant corruption is beginning to believe that the long arm of the law will finally prevail. The charge of ED being used as a ‘political weapon’ by the ruling government at the Centre should not surface in this case,” the party said.

Alex, member of the State Planning Commission. Speaking at a special District Planning Committee meeting held here to present the development vision and ideas that can be implemented by various departments in collaboration with the local bodies for the implementation of the 14th Five Year Plan, Mr. Alex said that the development model of Kerala would be based on what was achieved in the 14th Plan. He said people working in the unorganised sector had lost their jobs in the past two years. There was a loss of income for many, including small business owners and traders. The consequence of the COVID-19 outbreak was that many had suffered financial losses, which could not be met even after four or five years, he said. He said the main objective of the 14th plan was economic recovery. The growth in all sectors must be achieved. Production and productivity in the agricultural sector should be increased. There should be more jobs related to it. There should be more capital investment. Growth should be achieved in all sectors, including dairy, animal husbandry, fisheries, small scale industries and arts and culture, he said. Mr. Alex said that the Local Self Government (LSG) should prioritise activities such as job creation, productive growth, sustainable development and combating climate change.  There should be a plan to create jobs in each sector. LSGs should be responsible for the implementation of the scheme, he said, adding that available resources should be used efficiently.

The court of Justice Raj Mohan Singh also disposed of the plea filed by a Patiala resident who had challenged the furlough granted to Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh in February. The order was pronounced on Thursday. The petition was disposed of as infructuous as Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh had already returned to jail. The Dera Sacha Sauda chief, who is lodged in Rohtak's Sunaria jail, was granted a three-week furlough on February 7 to meet his family in Gurugram after the Haryana government concluded that he does not fall in the category of hardcore prisoners. Furlough is a short-term temporary release of convicts from jail.  Kanika Ahuja, one of the counsels of the Dera chief on Friday said the court has held that Ram Rahim does not fall in the category of ""hardcore prisoners"". Petitioner Paramjit Singh Saholi had contended that Ram Rahim had committed a heinous crime for which he has been convicted and therefore he should not be granted furlough. The counsel for the Dera chief argued that he does not fall in the category of ""hardcore prisoners"" as he was convicted for the charges of criminal conspiracy in the two murder cases. Ram Rahim is serving a 20-year jail term for raping two women disciples at his ashram in Sirsa, where the 'dera' is headquartered. He was convicted by a special CBI court in Panchkula in August 2017. Last year, the Dera sect head was also convicted along with four others for hatching a conspiracy to kill Dera Manager Ranjit Singh in 2002. In 2019, Ram Rahim and three others were also convicted for the murder of a journalist in 2002. He had been held guilty of hatching a criminal conspiracy with his co-accused for these killings and convicted under Section 120-B read with Section 302 IPC. The punishment of life term in the two separate murder cases will commence after he completes his sentence in the rape case.  Ram Rahim had been given Z-plus security cover during his 21-day release on furlough in February considering the ""high-level threat"" to his life from ""pro-Khalistan"" elements.

While the ‘hasi Karaga’ will be taken out on April 14, the ‘Karaga Shakyotsava’ (the main event) will be held on April 16. The Karaga will be celebrated on a grand scale after a gap of two years. Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the celebrations were restricted to within the Dharmaraya Swamy Temple in 2020 and 2021. As per the ritual, the Karaga will visit the Hazrat Tawakkal Mastan Dargah and then proceed along the traditional route. There were rumours that certain persons identifying with a few right-wing groups had objected to the Karaga visiting the dargah. However, Chikpete MLA Uday Garudachar and MLC P.R. Ramesh stated that there would be no change in any ritual that has been practised for decades.  “The Karaga visiting the dargah is a tradition that will not be tampered with.

Members of the dargah committee had met the Karaga committee and extended all cooperation for smooth conduct of the festivities.

The British government said on Friday that it is imposing asset freezes and travel bans on Putin’s daughters Katerina Tikhonova and Maria Vorontsova, as well as Yekaterina Vinokurova, daughter of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. The EU included Maria Vorontsova and Katerina Tikhonova in its updated list of individuals facing an assets freeze and travel ban. The two EU officials from different EU member countries spoke on Friday on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press because the updated list of individuals and entities sanctioned has not been published yet. The move from the European bloc follows a similar move two days earlier by the United States. In the wake of evidence of torture and killings emerging from war zones outside Kyiv, the EU decided to impose a fifth package of measures. “These latest sanctions were adopted following the atrocities committed by Russian armed forces in Bucha and other places under Russian occupation,"" said Josep Borrell, the EU's top diplomat. “The aim of our sanctions is to stop the reckless, inhuman and aggressive behaviour of the Russian troops and make clear to the decision makers in the Kremlin that their illegal aggression comes at a heavy cost."" In addition to sanctions on individuals and members of their families, oligarchs and high-ranking Kremlin officials, the 27-nation bloc also formally approved on Friday an embargo on coal imports starting in August, as well as a full transaction ban on four key Russian banks representing 23% of market share in the Russian banking sector.  Also, vessels registered under the Russian flag are now prohibited to access EU ports, with an exception for agricultural and food products, humanitarian aid and energy. This is the first time that EU sanctions target Russia’s lucrative energy industry over its war in Ukraine. According to the EU council, imports of coal into the region are currently worth 8 billion euros per year. The EU has already started working on additional sanctions, including on oil imports. Britain says it has sanctioned more than 1,200 Russian individuals and businesses since the invasion of Ukraine on February 24, including 76 oligarchs and 16 banks. It says Western nations have collectively frozen 275 billion pounds ($360 billion), amounting to 60% of Russian foreign currency reserves.  EU officials said the impact of the bloc’s sanctions so far over the first four weeks shows that imports into the 27 nations from Russia dropped off by 9% in terms of value, and over 20% in terms of volume.

500,"April 08, 2022",15:33 IST,news,international,Foreign businesses question Myanmar foreign currency rules," Foreign business groups in Myanmar have raised concerns about new rules requiring businesses and individuals to convert all foreign currency held in bank accounts into the local currency.  A statement issued on April 8 by the American Chamber of Commerce and British, French, Australian chambers and similar groups says the rules would lower Myanmar standards of living, stop foreign business activity and foreign investment and cause trade tensions.  “As written, the regulations effectively prevent the use of foreign currency in Myanmar which disconnects Myanmar from the global economy and global financial system,"" it says. “Implementation of these measures and the associated lack of clear exemptions for foreign investments creates significant and for some, insurmountable challenges to all businesses operating in Myanmar,"" the statement says.  Details of the new rules have yet to be announced. But the central bank said in another notice that they would apply to income from export and other sources such as services, investments, loans for investment and other transactions. The change appears aimed at helping make up for a shortfall in hard currency following a February 1, 2021 military takeover that ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi.  The U.S. and other Western countries have imposed targeted sanctions on the military, army-affiliated businesses, military leaders and their families. The economy has slumped amid widespread public resistance to the takeover and the pandemic, which has in turn kept away tourists whose spending accounts for a large share of the country's foreign exchange earnings.  A deputy governor of Myanmar’s Central Bank was shot at her home on Thursday, days after the tough new regulations were issued. There were conflicting accounts of whether Than Than Swe, appointed to her post after the military seized power, survived the attack. Myanmar has been ruled by the military for most of the time since it gained independence from the British in 1948. But for about a decade beginning in 2011 the country began a faltering transition toward democracy and its economy began to take off as it opened further to foreign investment. Scores of foreign businesses have opted to leave since the military seized power last year.

For weeks, Sri Lankans have been out on the streets every day, protesting the government’s “mishandling” of the economic crisis that has left them scrambling for food, fuel, and medicines, amid long power cuts. Demonstrators across the country are asking President Gotabaya and the ruling family to step down. While all ministers in cabinet resigned last weekend, amidst the growing public outrage, the President and his brother Mahinda Rajapaksa, who is the Prime Minister, stubbornly remain in office. All opposition parties have rejected Mr. Gotabaya’s offer to form a national government under his Presidency.  Speaking in parliament during the adjournment debate on the International Monetary Fund report on Sri Lanka’s economic situation, Mr. Premadasa told Mr. Gotabaya: “Either lead, follow, or get out of the way.” In addition to demanding that the President step down, Mr. Premadasa, leader of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB or United People’s Force) also sought the abolition of Executive Presidency, a system of governance that gives sweeping powers to the office.  While Mr. Premadasa appeared to echo the chief demand of citizens across the country in the House, getting a No Confidence Motion through may not be all that simple. Even with the support of all other parties sitting in opposition the SJB, which has 54 seats, can muster just over 70 votes. A simple majority needed to pass a trust vote in the 225-member legislature, would be impossible without support from the 42 government MPs, now sitting independently, and other potential defectors.  Impeaching the President, too, is not possible without two-thirds of the House backing a motion for it, along with a favourable hearing from the Supreme Court. However, as the government’s popularity dips further by the day its lawmakers – some of their homes have already been attacked by angry protestors – are under significant pressure.  The President or Prime Minister are yet to make any public address since protests escalated in the country. Citizens have rejected the Mr. Gotabaya’s efforts to appoint a “new cabinet”, as their slogans and posters showed. Curiously, the “new” Finance Minister appointed by the President earlier this week, who resigned the following day, on Friday told Parliament he was still holding the portfolio.  Meanwhile, protests continue surging across the country, with now IT professionals, teachers, lawyers, health workers, and students coming out in larger numbers. Police used tear gas and water cannons on university students who marched to the Parliament on Friday. More agitations and rallies are expected in Colombo this weekend, ahead of the Sinhala and Tamil New Year next week, one of the biggest festivals in Sri Lanka that will be marked amid severe shortages this time.

Photos from the scene showed bodies covered with tarps on the ground and the remnants of a rocket with the words “For the children” painted on it in Russian. About 4,000 civilians were in and around the station, the office of Ukraine’s prosecutor-general said, adding that most were women and children heeding calls to leave the area before Russia launches a full-scale offensive in the country’s east. President Volodymyr Zelensky reported 300 were injured, saying the strike showed “evil with no limits”. AFP journalists on the scene saw the bodies of at least 30 people grouped and lying under plastic sheets next to the station, before being loaded onto a military truck. Russia, however, accused Kyiv of carrying out the deadly attack. ""The purpose of the Kyiv regime's attack on the railway station in Kramatorsk was to disrupt the mass exit of residents from the city in order to use them as a 'human shield' to defend the positions of Ukraine's armed forces,"" the Defence Ministry said. ""Tochka-U tactical missiles, the fragments of which were found near the railway station of Kramatorsk, are used only by the Ukrainian armed forces,"" the Ministry added. The station is used to evacuate civilians from areas under bombardment from Russian forces. ""Two rockets hit Kramatorsk railway station. There are casualties,"" Ukrainian Railways said in a statement. It gave no other details. Three trains carrying evacuees were blocked in the same region of Ukraine on Thursday after an air strike on the line, according to the head of Ukrainian Railways. Ukrainian officials say Russian forces have been regrouping for a new offensive, and that Moscow plans to seize as much territory as it can in the eastern part of Ukraine known as Donbas bordering Russia.

503,"April 08, 2022",14:21 IST,news,international,World food prices hit record high over Ukraine war: FAO," World food prices hit an all-time high in March as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent “shocks” through markets for staple grains and vegetable oils, the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization said on Friday. The disruption in export flows resulting from the February 24 invasion and international sanctions against Russia has spurred fears of a global hunger crisis, especially across the Middle East and Africa, where the knock-on effects are already playing out. Russia and Ukraine, whose vast grain-growing regions are among the world’s main breadbaskets, account for a huge share of the globe’s exports in several major commodities, including wheat, vegetable oil and corn. “World food commodity prices made a significant leap in March to reach their highest levels ever, as war in the Black Sea region spread shocks through markets for staple grains and vegetable oils,” the FAO said in a statement. The FAO’s food price index, which had already reported a record in February, surged by 12.6 percent last month, “making a giant leap to a new highest level since its inception in 1990”, the UN agency said. The index, a measure of the monthly change in international prices of a basket of food commodities, averaged 159.3 points in March. The jump includes new all-time highs for vegetable oils, cereals and meats, the FAO said, adding that prices of sugar and dairy products “also rose significantly”. Russia and Ukraine together accounted for around 30 percent and 20 percent of global wheat and maize exports respectively, over the past three years, the FAO said. The war continues to rage as sowing season has started in Ukraine. Wheat prices rose by almost 20 percent, with the problem exacerbated by concerns over crop conditions in the United States, the organization said. The FAO’s vegetable oil price index surged by 23.2 percent, driven by higher quotations for sunflower seed oil, of which Ukraine is the world’s leading exporter. Spanish supermarkets have rationed the sale of sunflower oil to stop customers stockpiling over shortage fears due to the war. The United States has accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of creating “this global food crisis”. France has warned that the war has increased the risk of famine around the world. The conflict has also sent oil and gas prices through the roof, causing inflation to rise further across the world and raising concerns that it could derail global economic growth.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/world-food-prices-hit-record-high-over-ukraine-war-fao/article65302489.ece
504,"April 08, 2022",12:54 IST,news,international,"U. S. lawmakers introduce Bill to utilise 3,80,000 unused family- and employment-based visas"," A group of influential U. S. lawmakers has introduced a Bill in Congress to recapture nearly 3,80,000 unused family and employment-based visas to reduce a massive Green Card backlog, a move which could benefit thousands of highly-skilled IT professionals from India.  A Green Card, known officially as a Permanent Resident Card, is a document issued to immigrants to the U. S. as evidence that the bearer has been granted the privilege of residing permanently. As per a 2020 report, the backlog for an Indian national to get permanent residency or Green Card is more than 195 years.  The Jumpstart Our Legal Immigration System Act, introduced by House Immigration and Citizenship Subcommittee Chair Zoe Lofgren, proposes to recapture about 2,22,000 unused family-sponsored visas and about 1,57,000 employment-based visas.  Among other things, it would allow immigrant U. S. residents eligible for adjustment to Legal Permanent Residence (LPR) status to apply for adjustment after paying a fee but are not able to do so presently due to the lack of an available visa number.  In a major boost to a large number of Indians, this will allow them to receive work authorisation while they wait for a visa number to become available and will prevent dependent children from “ageing out” of eligibility for the LPR status. Indian IT professionals, most of whom are highly skilled and come to the U. S. mainly on the H-1B work visas, are the worst sufferers of the current immigration system which imposes a 7% per country quota on allotment of the coveted Green Card or permanent legal residency.  The H-1B visa, the most sought after among Indian IT professionals, is a non-immigrant visa that allows U. S. companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. Technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries such as India and China.  The legislation also seeks to allow immigrants in the U. S. to receive an exemption from the immigrant visa numerical limits and adjust their status to a green card if their immigrant visa petition has been approved for two years and they pay a supplemental fee. Its co-sponsors are House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerrold Nadler and Congresswoman Judy Chu and Congressman Ritchie Torres.  “We all know that our immigration system is dysfunctional and it has been in dire need of reform for decades,” said Ms. Lofgren.  “The basic framework for allocating immigrant visas dates back to the middle of the 20th century and was updated last seriously in 1990 when Congress established the worldwide numerical limits on visas and the 7% per-country cap that still exists today. Over time, these limitations have led to backlogs that were unimaginable in 1990,” she said.  “The Act will help reduce the backlogs, thereby enabling immigrants to fully contribute to their communities and our national economy, while also allowing the U. S. companies to attract and retain high-skilled workers. That will enhance our country’s competitive advantage and our position as a global leader in innovation,” she said.  Mr. Nadler said: “By restoring the availability of immigrant visas lost due to COVID-19 or bureaucratic delay and enhancing green card processing, we are investing in our families and the U. S. businesses. Our immigration system is in desperate need of reform and this legislation is a vital step in the right direction... the Act will recapture some 4,00,000 family - and employment-based visas, create an accelerated path to adjustment of status for those already here and give much needed funds to the U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to improve visa processing”.  Congresswoman Chu said that there are over four million people in the family immigration backlogs waiting to be reunited with their loved ones. “Recapturing unused visas that were lost to delays and bureaucracy would help ease the already burdensome backlogs for immigrant families and workers,” Ms. Chu said.

505,"April 08, 2022",12:02 IST,news,international,Russia’s suspension from UN Human Rights Council ‘meaningful step’ by global community: US President Joe Biden," U. S. President Joe Biden has lauded the suspension of Russia, a veto-wielding permanent member of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), from the world organisation's leading human rights body, saying this ""meaningful step"" by the international community has further demonstrated how President Vladimir Putin’s war has made his country an “international pariah”.  The 193-member United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on April 7 voted to adopt a draft resolution moved by the U. S. to suspend Russia from the Geneva-based United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) over allegations that Russian soldiers killed civilians while retreating from towns near the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.  The ‘Suspension of the rights of membership of the Russian Federation in the Human Rights Council’ resolution was adopted with 93 votes in favour, 24 against and 58 abstentions. India abstained from voting. Reacting to Russia’s suspension from the UNHRC, U.S. President Mr. Biden said: “this is a meaningful step by the international community further demonstrating how Vladimir Putin’s war has made Russia an international pariah”.  Mr. Biden said the U. S. worked closely with its allies and partners around the world to drive this vote because Russia is committing gross and systemic violations of human rights. “Russian forces are committing war crimes. Russia has no place on the Human Rights Council. After today’s historic vote, Russia will not be able to participate in the Council’s work or spread its disinformation there as the Council’s Commission of Inquiry investigates Russia’s violations and abuses of human rights in Ukraine,” he said.  No permanent member of the United Nations Security Council has ever had its membership revoked from any organ of the world body. The UNHRC is a United Nations body whose mission is to promote and protect human rights around the world.  Observing that the images coming out of Bucha and other areas of Ukraine as Russian troops withdraw are horrifying, he said the signs of people being raped, tortured, executed — in some cases having their bodies desecrated — are an outrage to our common humanity.  “Russia’s lies are no match for the undeniable evidence of what is happening in Ukraine. That’s why nations in every region condemn Russia’s unprovoked and brutal aggression against Ukraine and support the brave people of Ukraine in their fight for freedom.  The U. S. will continue to work with responsible nations around the world to gather evidence to hold Russia accountable for the atrocities being committed, increase the pressure on Russia’s economy and isolate Russia on the international stage, Mr. Biden said. In a statement, U. S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, on Russia’s suspension from the UNHRC, said “a wrong has been righted”. “Today, a wrong has been righted. The world is sending another clear signal that Russia must immediately and unconditionally cease its war of aggression against Ukraine and honour the principles enshrined in the UN Charter,” Mr. Blinken said.  “By suspending Russia from the UN Human Rights Council, countries around the world chose to hold Moscow to account today for gross and systematic violations of human rights in its premeditated, unprovoked and unjustified war of choice against Ukraine,” he said.  “We have seen growing evidence of Russia’s brutal disregard for international law and human rights in Ukraine, most notably in the death and devastation it has caused in communities such as Bucha, Irpin and Mariupol. The atrocities the world has witnessed appear to be further evidence of war crimes, which serves as another indication that Russia has no place in a body whose primary purpose is to promote respect for human rights,” Mr. Blinken said.  U. S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield, in her remarks at the UN General Assembly Emergency Special Session to suspend Russia from the UN Human Rights Council, described this as an important and historic moment. “Countries from around the globe have voted to suspend Russia from the UN Human Rights Council for its gross and systematic violations of human rights. We have collectively sent a strong message that the suffering of victims and survivors will not be ignored,” she said.  “After all, this is not only about accountability for Russia. It’s about standing with the people of Ukraine. And it’s about the credibility of the UN. Right now, the world is looking to us; they are asking if the United Nations is prepared to meet this moment. They are wondering if we are a platform for propaganda and a safe haven for human rights abusers – or if we are prepared to live up to our highest ideals, enshrined in the UN Charter,” she said.  “The international community has taken a collective step in the right direction,” Thomas-Greenfield added. The Human Rights Council consists of 47 Member States, elected directly and individually by secret ballot by the majority of the members of the General Assembly. The General Assembly, by a two-thirds majority of the members present and voting, “may suspend the rights of membership in the Council of a member of the Council that commits gross and systematic violations of human rights.” ",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/joe-biden-says-russias-ouster-from-un-human-rights-council-meaningful-step-by-global-community/article65302176.ece
506,"April 08, 2022",11:51 IST,news,international,Explained | The Infosys assets controversy involving Rishi Sunak and wife Akshata Murthy," The story so far: It was reported in British newspapers on Thursday, April 7, that Akshata Murthy, the wife of Indian-origin United Kingdom Finance Minister Rishi Sunak and daughter of Infosys co-founder Narayan Murthy, claims a non-domiciled tax status in the UK. Under British law, this essentially means that one does not have to pay taxes on dividend benefits received from overseas companies.  Rishi Sunak is the current Chancellor of the Exchequer or Finance Minister of the UK, the second most important government position in the country. Major political observers in the UK have pegged him as the next candidate for the Prime Minister’s position after the country's current leader Boris Johnson.  He was appointed to the position in February 2020 by Mr. Johnson, at a time when the pandemic-hit UK was facing its most difficult economic challenge since the 2008 recession and even the Second World War. It was simultaneously bracing for post-Brexit trading arrangements with the European Union to kick in.  Mr. Sunak’s father is an Indian-born general physician with the UK’s National Health Service (NHS), and his mother runs an independent pharmacy. He got elected as an MP from Richmond (Yorks) in 2015. He got his degree in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics from Oxford, and pursued an MBA from Stanford University. He served at the Parliament Under Secretary level during former British PM Theresa May’s second term. He regularly supported the Brexit move and Mr. Johnson’s prime ministerial campaign. In 2019, after Mr. Johnson took charge, the MP was given the high-profile role of Chief Secretary to the Treasury.  In his term as the Finance Minister, the social-media-savvy politician, known for creating his own “brand”, has presented two national budgets and other interim financial statements. While studying at Stanford, Mr. Sunak met Akshata Murthy, the daughter of N.R. Narayana Murthy, the co-founder of Bengaluru-headquartered IT services giant Infosys. Ms. Murthy has been residing in the UK since 2015. She worked at Deloitte and Unilever before going for the Stanford MBA. She now co-owns a London-based startup investment company called Catamaran Ventures UK with her husband.  Ms. Murthy also holds a 0.93% stake in Infosys, having $900 million (£690 million) to her name.  At a time when UK citizens face the highest levels of taxation since the 1940s, major British dailies carried the news on Thursday that the Finance Minister’s wife claims a non-domiciled tax status in the country, which allows her to not pay taxes on the annual dividend benefits of £11.5 million that she receives off her stake in Infosys.  The Guardian reported that all other British taxpayers pay a 38.1% tax on dividend payouts. According to the daily, the non-domicile status was introduced in 1799. Under this, those not domiciled in the UK can avoid paying taxes on their overseas income received in the form of dividends, bank interests and foreign property rents. A person automatically gets deemed as domiciled after living in the UK for 15 years, and Ms. Murthy has been residing in the country since 2015.  The news kicked up a storm, giving rise to questions from Opposition MPs directed at the Chancellor and elicited a clarification from Ms. Murthy’s spokesperson.  Labour Party leader and opposition Treasury spokesperson, Tulip Saddiq said Mr. Sunak should come out and clear whether he benefited from the Infosys dividend payouts received by his wife.  Ms. Murthy’s spokesperson put out a statement on Thursday saying that she pays taxes on all her income generated within the UK.  ""Akshata Murty is a citizen of India, the country of her birth and parent's home. India does not allow its citizens to hold the citizenship of another country simultaneously. She has always and will continue to pay UK taxes on all her UK income."" According to Reuters, a person familiar with the matter said that Mr. Sunak had informed the British government and the Treasury about his wife’s tax status at the time of becoming a Minister. The source also said that Ms. Murthy pays foreign taxes on her foreign income.  Just a few weeks before this, as trouble was intensifying in Ukraine as a result of the Russian incursion, another row unfolded over Ms. Murthy’s income from Infosys, when the company was still operating some of its functions in Russia.  Since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the special military operation in Ukraine, the West and major European nations have retaliated with draining economic sanctions against Moscow, with a list of major global corporate giants such as Netflix, Shell, KPMG, PwC, Goldman Sachs and so on, pulling out of Russia.  Since the start of the Ukraine crisis, Mr. Sunak himself has regularly urged British companies to exit Russia to “inflict maximum economic pain” on the Vladimir Putin administration.  It was revealed in late March that Infosys runs a small part of its operations in Russia; Sky News had said that the company has a delivery office there and relations with the Russian Alpha Bank.  Opposition politicians from Labour and liberal parties, aside from the press mounted pressure on Mr. Sunak to answer “very serious questions” about Ms. Murthy’s stake in Infosys, which at the time had not shut down its operations in Russia.  The Treasury spokeswoman of the Liberal Democrat party, Christine Jardine, asked Mr. Sunak to put out a clarification. She said: “The public deserves full transparency on this issue. It cannot be one rule for the chancellor and another for everyone else.” Labour Party’s Louise Haigh said it was “shocking” that the Chancellor’s family “itself was benefitting from business in Russia”.  When questioned on whether his family benefited from the Russian regime in a television interview on Sky News, the Finance Minister had said: “I don’t think that’s the case. I am an elected politician and I am here to talk about what I am responsible for. My wife is not.” A spokesperson of Mr. Sunak had said that neither his wife nor her family members were empowered to make any operation decisions in Infosys.  The sparking of questions prompted Infosys to release a statement saying that it had a small team of employees based out of Russia to serve some of the firm’s global clients, adding that it did not have “any active business relationships with local Russian enterprises”.  The statement read further: ""Infosys supports and advocates for peace between Russia and Ukraine and has committed $1m to relief efforts for the victims of war from Ukraine.” As pressure kept mounting on the Chancellor, it was reported that Infosys eventually decided to move its services from Russia to its other global delivery centres, ",Diksha Munjal,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/rishi-sunak-akshata-murthy-controversy-over-infosys-assets-tax/article65299708.ece
507,"April 08, 2022",10:25 IST,news,international,Elon Musk earns a seat on Twitter’s board; what next?," The story so far: On Monday, Elon Musk took a 9.2% stake in Twitter, according to a U.S. securities exchange filing. He reported owning 73.5 million shares of the social media company as of March 14, an announcement that sent the company’s shares soaring 27% at the New York Stock Exchange. Mr. Musk’s stake is valued at $2.9 billion based on Friday’s closing price, and makes him Twitter’s largest shareholder, holding more than the company’s co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey. That size has earned him a seat at the social media firm’s board. The CEO of Tesla is Twitter’s most famous ‘blue tick’ personality with over 80 million followers on the platform. He is a regular user of the micro-blogging site, and its most vocal critique. While Mr. Musk did not share any details about why he bought shares of Twitter, except posting a tweet on Monday saying: “oh hi lol”, there are some cues to what he might end up doing at the California-based company.  In recent times, the billionaire had weighed up the platform’s commitment to free speech. In some of his tweets, he had broached the idea of starting his own social media firm, without disclosing specifics.  On March 24, Mr. Musk tweeted a poll asking his followers whether the platform “rigorously adheres” to free speech. Over 70% of the two million users, who voted, clicked ‘no’. Mr. Musk’s poll came two weeks after the Twitter handle of a U.S.-based parody website, Babylon Bee, was taken down ‘for hateful comment’. The website had derisively awarded Rachel Levine, a transgender U.S. government official, the title “Man of the Year”. The site’s award was in response to USA Today naming the government health official one of the “Women of the Year”.  That piece of satire was posted on Twitter, which led the platform to block the parody account’s handle. Reacting to Twitter’s suspension, Seth Dillon, the CEO of Babylon Bee, explained in a series of tweets that the platform would not restore the account until the tweet on Ms. Levine was deleted. Mr. Dillon refused. The site’s handle is now unblocked, but it has been kept from posting new content.  After Mr. Musk joined Twitter’s board, Mr. Dillon replied to the two-week old poll tweet on Tuesday saying, “Musk reached out to us before he polled his followers about Twitter's commitment to free speech. He wanted to confirm that we had, in fact, been suspended. He even mused on that call that he might need to buy Twitter.” In a separate episode, several conservatives took to the micro-blogging site on Monday expressing hope that Mr. Musk would overturn Twitter’s decision to de-platform former U.S. President Donald Trump after the infamous January 6 U.S. Capitol attack.  Later, on the same day, on March 24, Mr. Musk once again reached out to his followers on Twitter. This time, he conducted a poll on whether the platform’s algorithm be made open source or not. The poll was retweeted by co-founder Mr. Dorsey with a note “the choice to which algorithm to use (or not) should be open to everyone.” Over 80% of the million odd users who took the poll voted ‘yes’.  Some experts note that making social media algorithms open source could weed out misinformation and hatred from these platforms. Having an idea of what a platform prioritises over another will help users to be more informed, and keep bad actors from manipulating the system. But others point out that the codes that run these platforms are part of the corporation’s trade secret. Balancing disclosure and corporate secrecy will be a tough act to follow as most tech firms may not even have a team that has a full view of how their algorithm works. It continues to be a black box that few have complete access to.  While crafting policies around content moderation and open-source algorithm could take much of Mr. Musk’s time at Twitter in the long-term, a fight with financial regulators in the U.S. will be an urgent priority. That’s because, according to the filing, Mr. Musk’s disclosed 9.2% holding was submitted in a form that is required for investors to use when they pick more than 5% stock, without planning to seek control of the company. But the Tesla CEO will have an active role to play at Twitter. Also, Mr. Musk’s notice to the exchange was sent several days later.  According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) has previously brought enforcement actions against some people who missed ownership-disclosure deadlines repeatedly. And Mr. Musk’s disclosure could hurt him in his ongoing legal battles with the SEC.

508,"April 08, 2022",09:23 IST,news,international,"Russia-Ukraine crisis live updates | Death toll in Kramatorsk railway station strike rises to 50, including 5 children"," A rocket attack on a train station in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk killed dozens on Friday as civilians raced to leave the Donbas region in the crosshairs of the Russian Army. At least 50 people were killed, including five children, Pavlo Kyrylenko, the Governor of the Donetsk region said, in one of the deadliest strikes of the six-week-old war. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reported 300 were injured, saying the strike showed “evil with no limits”. The station is used to evacuate civilians from areas under bombardment from Russian forces. Russia has accused Kyiv of staging the attack.  Russia, however, accused Kyiv of carrying out the deadly attack. ""The purpose of the Kyiv regime's attack on the railway station in Kramatorsk was to disrupt the mass exit of residents from the city in order to use them as a 'human shield' to defend the positions of Ukraine's armed forces,"" the Defence Ministry said Britain and the European Union have added two adult daughters of Russian President Vladimir Putin to their sanctions list, as part of a new package of measures targeting Russia's economy, businessmen and oligarchs in retaliation for the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine.  Here are the latest updates: At least 50 people, including five children, were killed in strikes on a train station in the east Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk, the local governor said Friday. “Fifty dead, five of them children. This is the death toll at this hour after the strike by Russian occupational forces on the train station in Kramatorsk,” Pavlo Kyrylenko, the Governor of the Donetsk region, said on Telegram.  He warned that the number of victims is likely to change, saying there are still 98 people wounded, including 16 children. Mr. Kyrylenko said 12 of the victims died from their wounds in hospital, while 38 were killed “on the spot.” He said, “The occupiers must be punished for their crimes.”  The attack on the train station came on Friday morning, when hundreds gathered, waiting to be evacuated out of east Ukraine where a renewed Russian offensive looms. Russia on Friday accused Kyiv of carrying out a deadly attack on a railway station in the city of Kramatorsk in eastern Ukraine that claimed dozens of lives. ""The purpose of the Kyiv regime's attack on the railway station in Kramatorsk was to disrupt the mass exit of residents from the city in order to use them as a 'human shield' to defend the positions of Ukraine's armed forces,"" the Defence Ministry said in a statement. The Ministry claimed that the attack was carried out by Ukraine's forces from the town of Dobropillya, some 45 kilometres (27 miles) southwest of Kramatorsk.  ""Tochka-U tactical missiles, the fragments of which were found near the railway station of Kramatorsk, are used only by the Ukrainian armed forces,"" the Ministry added. Earlier on Friday, the Ministry denied it was behind the attack that killed at least 39 people, including at least four children, and said it was a ""provocation"" from the Ukrainian side. - AFP The European Union nations have agreed to ban Russian coal in the first sanctions on the vital energy industry over the war in Ukraine, but it has underlined the 27 countries' inability to agree so far on a much more sweeping embargo on oil and natural gas that would hit Russia harder but risk recession at home. The coal ban should cost Russia 4 billion euros ($4.4 billion) a year, the EU's executive commission said. Energy analysts and coal importers say Europe could replace Russian supply in a few months from other countries, including the U.S. Slovak Prime Minister Eduard Heger on Friday said the EU member had given Ukraine an S-300 air defence system, adding that it did not mean Slovakia had joined the conflict with Russia.  “I can confirm that the Slovak Republic has donated the S-300 air defence system to Ukraine, following Ukraine’s request for assistance,” Heger posted on Facebook.  “The donation of the system does not mean that the Slovak Republic has become a part of the armed conflict in Ukraine,” he added. - AFP Thirty-nine people were killed, including four children, Ukraine’s SBU security service said, in one of the deadliest strikes of the six-week-old war.  President Volodymyr Zelensky reported 300 were injured, saying the strike showed “evil with no limits”.  AFP journalists on the scene saw the bodies of at least 30 people grouped and lying under plastic sheets next to the station, before being loaded onto a military truck. Blood was pooling on the ground and packed bags were strewn outside the building in the immediate aftermath of the attack. The remains of a large rocket with the words “for our children” in Russian was lying just adjacent to the main building. - AFP Britain and the European Union have added two adult daughters of Russian President Vladimir Putin to their sanctions list, as part of a new package of measures targeting Russia's economy, businessmen and oligarchs in retaliation for the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine.  The British government said on Friday that it is imposing asset freezes and travel bans on Putin’s daughters Katerina Tikhonova and Maria Vorontsova, as well as Yekaterina Vinokurova, daughter of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. The EU included Maria Vorontsova and Katerina Tikhonova in its updated list of individuals facing an assets freeze and travel ban. — AP World food prices hit an all-time high in March as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent “shocks” through markets for staple grains and vegetable oils, the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization said on Friday. Russia and Ukraine, whose vast grain-growing regions are among the world’s main breadbaskets, account for a huge share of the globe’s exports in several major commodities, including wheat, vegetable oil and corn. Two Russian rockets have struck a railway station in Kramatorsk in eastern Ukraine, causing casualties, Ukraine's state railway company said on Friday. The station is used to evacuate civilians from areas under bombardment from Russian forces. ""Two rockets hit Kramatorsk railway station. There are casualties,"" Ukrainian Railways said in a statement. It gave no other details. Russian troops retreating from this northern Ukrainian city left behind crushed buildings, streets littered with destroyed cars and residents in dire need of food and other aid — images that added fuel to Kyiv's calls Thursday for more Western help to halt Moscow's next offensive.  Dozens of people lined up to receive bread, diapers and medicine from vans parked outside a shattered school now serving as an aid-distribution point in Chernihiv, which Russian forces besieged for weeks as part of their attempt to sweep south towards the capital before retreating. - AP Civilians in eastern Ukraine struggled to evacuate Friday as Russia redirects its firepower, with President Volodymyr Zelensky warning of ""even more horrific"" devastation being uncovered around the capital. Ukrainian allies tightened the screws on Moscow further in response to shocking images from Bucha and other regions around Kyiv, with the European Union announcing an embargo on Russian coal and a ban on Russian vessels at its ports. - AFP The US government has banned exports to Russian state airline Aeroflot as well as two other carriers for flying aircraft in violation of sanctions, the Commerce Department said Thursday. Washington warned last month that the carriers had gone against penalties imposed on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine by flying Boeing aircraft, as had billionaire Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich for his use of a Gulfstream jet. - AFP Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Thursday he expected NATO members to send Kyiv the weapons it needs but insisted they had to act quickly as Russia readies another major offensive. “Either you help us now – and I’m speaking about days, not weeks, or your help will come too late, and many people will die, many civilians will lose their homes, many villages will be destroyed. Exactly because this help came too late,” Kuleba said after meeting NATO foreign ministers in Brussels. India will be “glad” to help in bringing about a resolution to the crisis in Ukraine, External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishankar said on Wednesday. Speaking in the Lok Sabha during a discussion under Rule 193 regarding the crisis in Ukraine and its implications, Dr. Jaishankar said that Russia is “a very important partner” but also held that India is against the conflict. He acknowledged the support provided by Russia, Ukraine and even Indian nationals based in Eastern Europe during Operation Ganga to evacuate Indian students from Ukraine.   “In terms of diplomacy, India continues to press forcefully for an immediate cessation of hostilities and an end to violence. We encourage talks between Ukraine and Russia, including at the level of their Presidents. The Prime Minister has spoken to them both in this regard. This was precisely the message that was conveyed to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov when he was in Delhi. If India can be of any assistance in this matter, we will be glad to contribute,” Dr. Jaishankar said, reiterating India’s commitment to supply humanitarian goods to Ukraine.",The Hindu Bureau,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/russia-ukraine-crisis-live-updates-civilians-flee-east-ukraine-amid-warnings-of-horrific-abuses/article65302032.ece

510,"April 08, 2022",00:29 IST,news,international,U.S. Senate confirms Ketanji Brown Jackson as first black woman Supreme Court justice," The Senate confirmed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court on Thursday, shattering a historic barrier by securing her place as the first Black woman Justice and giving President Joe Biden a bipartisan endorsement for his effort to diversify the court.  Judge Jackson, a 51 year-old appeals court justice with nine years experience on the federal bench, was confirmed 53-47, mostly along party lines but with three Republican votes. Presiding was Vice-President Kamala Harris, also the first Black woman to reach that high office.  “This is a wonderful day, a joyous day, an inspiring day — for the Senate, for the Supreme Court and for the United States of America,"" exulted Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.  Judge Jackson will take her seat when Judge Stephen Breyer retires this summer, solidifying the liberal wing of the 6-3 conservative-dominated court. She joined Mr. Biden at the White House to watch the vote, embracing as it came in. During the four days of Senate hearings last month, Judge Jackson spoke of her parents’ struggles through racial segregation and said her “path was clearer” than theirs as a Black American after the enactment of civil rights laws. She attended Harvard University, served as a public defender, worked at a private law firm and was appointed as a member of the U.S. Sentencing Commission.  She told Senators she would apply the law “without fear or favour,” and pushed back on Republican attempts to portray her as too lenient on criminals she had sentenced.  Judge Jackson will be just the third Black justice, after Thurgood Marshall and Clarence Thomas, and the sixth woman. She will join three other women, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan Amy Coney Barrett — meaning that four of the nine justices will be women for the first time in history.  Her eventual elevation to the court will be a respite for Democrats who fought three bruising battles over former President Donald Trump’s nominees and watched Republicans cement a conservative majority in the final days of Trump's term with the confirmation of Coney Barrett. While Judge Jackson won't change the balance, she will secure a legacy on the court for Biden and fulfill his 2020 campaign pledge to nominate the first Black woman justice.  Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said ahead of the vote that Judge Jackson's confirmation would be a “joyous day -- joyous for the Senate, joyous for the Supreme Court, joyous for America.”  Despite the efforts to tarnish her record, Judge Jackson eventually won three GOP votes. The final tally was far from the overwhelming bipartisan confirmations for Justice Breyer and other justices in decades past, but it was still a significant bipartisan accomplishment for Mr. Biden in the 50-50 split Senate after GOP senators aggressively worked to paint Jackson as too liberal and soft on crime.  Statements from Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney of Utah all said the same thing — they might not always agree with Jackson, but they found her to be enormously well qualified for the job. Collins and Murkowski both decried increasingly partisan confirmation fights, which only worsened during the battles over Trump’s three picks. Collins said the process was “broken” and Murkowski called it “corrosive” and “more detached from reality by the year.”  Mr. Biden, a veteran of a more bipartisan Senate, said from the day of Breyer's retirement announcement in January that he wanted support from both parties for his history-making nominee, and he invited Republicans to the White House as he made his decision. It was an attempted reset from Mr. Trump’s presidency, when Democrats vociferously opposed the three nominees, and from the end of President Barack Obama’s, when Republicans blocked nominee Merrick Garland from getting a vote.  Once sworn in, Judge Jackson will be the second youngest member of the court after Judge Barrett, 50. She will join a court on which no one is yet 75, the first time that has happened in nearly 30 years.  Her first term will be marked by cases involving race, both in college admissions and voting rights. She has pledged to sit out the court’s consideration of Harvard’s admissions programme since she is a member of its board of overseers. But the court could split off a second case involving a challenge to the University of North Carolina’s admissions process, which might allow her to weigh in on the issue. Republicans spent the confirmation hearings strongly questioning her sentencing record, including the sentences she handed down in child pornography cases, which they argued were too light. Jackson declared that “nothing could be further from the truth” and explained her reasoning in detail. Democrats said she was in line with other judges in her decisions. The GOP questioning in the Judiciary Committee showed the views of many Republicans, though, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who said in a floor speech Wednesday that Jackson “never got tough once in this area.”  Democrats criticised the Republicans’ questioning.  “You could try and create a straw man here, but it does not hold,” said New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker at the committee’s vote earlier this week. The panel deadlocked on the nomination 11-11, but the Senate voted to discharge it from committee and moved ahead with her confirmation.  In an impassioned moment during the hearings last month, Booker, who is Black, told Jackson that he felt emotional watching her testify. He said he saw “my ancestors and yours” in her image.  “But don’t worry, my sister,” Booker said. “Don’t worry. God has got you. And how do I know that? Because you’re here, and I know what it’s taken for you to sit in that seat.”",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-senate-confirms-ketanji-brown-jackson-as-first-black-woman-supreme-court-justice/article65300862.ece
511,"April 07, 2022",22:44 IST,news,international,‘Pelosi’s Taiwan trip to impact China ties’," China warned on Thursday it would take strong measures if U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan and said such a visit would severely impact Chinese-U.S. relations, following media reports she would go next week. China considers democratically ruled Taiwan its own territory and the subject is a constant source of friction between Beijing and Washington, especially given strong U.S. military and political support for the island. The possible visit has not been confirmed by Ms. Pelosi’s office or Taiwan’s government, but some Japanese and Taiwanese media reported it would take place after she visits Japan this weekend. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told reporters that Beijing firmly opposed all forms of official interactions between the United States and Taiwan, and Washington should cancel the trip. “If the United States insists on having its own way, China will take strong measures in response to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity. All possible consequences that arise from this will completely be borne by the U.S. side,” he added, without giving details. In Taipei, Taiwan Foreign Ministry spokesperson Joanne Ou said that inviting U.S. officials and dignitaries had always been “an important part” of the Ministry’s work, and that it would announce any official visits at an appropriate time. Sunday marks the 43rd anniversary of the U.S. signing into law the Taiwan Relations Act, which guides ties in the absence of formal diplomatic ties and enshrines a U.S. commitment to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself. The last time a House speaker visited Taiwan was in 1997, when Newt Gingrich met then-President Lee Teng-hui.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pelosis-taiwan-trip-to-impact-china-ties/article65300043.ece
512,"April 07, 2022",22:38 IST,news,international,Ukraine pleads for weapons as fight looms on eastern front," Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Thursday he expected NATO members to send Kyiv the weapons it needs but insisted they had to act quickly as Russia readies another major offensive.  ""Either you help us now – and I'm speaking about days, not weeks, or your help will come too late, and many people will die, many civilians will lose their homes, many villages will be destroyed. Exactly because this help came too late,"" Kuleba said after meeting NATO foreign ministers in Brussels. ""I have no doubts that Ukraine will have weapons necessary to fight. The question is the timeline. This discussion is not about the list of weapons. The discussion is about the timeline,"" he told journalists.  Ukraine is pushing the West to increase its arms supplies with heavier weaponry including air defence systems, artillery, armoured vehicles and jets, as Moscow refocuses its offensive on the east of the country. ""The battle for Donbas (in eastern Ukraine) will remind you of the Second World War with large operations manoeuvres, the involvement of thousands of tanks, armoured vehicles, planes, artillery,"" Mr. Kuleba said. ""Russia has its plan, we have ours -- and the outcome of this battle will be decided on the battlefield."" NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said ""it was a clear message from the meeting today that allies should do more and are ready to do more to provide more equipment"". ""They realise and recognise the urgency,"" Stoltenberg told the media.  British foreign minister Liz Truss said there ""was support for countries to supply new and heavier equipment to Ukraine, so that they can respond to these new threats from Russia."" She said Britain had agreed to help Ukrainian forces ""move from their Soviet era equipment to NATO standard equipment"", but gave no details on how this would be carried out. Alongside arms deliveries to Ukraine, the West has imposed a barrage of sanctions on Moscow aimed at battering Russia's economy.  Kuleba welcomed a fresh wave of sanctions announced by the US, Britain and EU in the wake of revelations of killings in the town of Bucha, but insisted Europe especially must go further on Russia's key oil and gas exports. ""As long as the West...continues buying Russian gas and oil it is supporting Ukraine with one hand while supporting Russia's war machine with another hand,"" he said.  ""We need steps which will stop Russia's war machine today."" He lamented that it was only after revelations of killings in Bucha that the EU had bolstered its latest round of sanctions to include tougher measures like a coal ban.  ""How many Buchas have to take place before you take the sanctions? How many children, women, men have to die?"" he said.  Asked about video footage circulating on social media of Ukrainian soldiers allegedly shooting a Russian captive, Kuleba said ""there might be isolated incidents"", but that Ukraine's army ""observes the rules of warfare"" and that violations would be investigated. However, he added, observers failed to understand how it feels ""knowing that the person you know was raped four days in a row"" and surviving other atrocities. ""This is not an excuse to those who violate the rules of warfare on either side of the frontline, but there are some things which you simply can't understand, I'm sorry."" He also rounded on his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov for maintaining Moscow's denial of responsibility for civilian deaths.  ""The fact that he justifies the bombing of a hospital in Mariupol and war crimes committed in Bucha and other Ukrainian cities and villages of Ukraine and calls them fake, makes him an accomplice to these crimes,"" Kuleba said. ""But I am ready to meet him because he is an official. If it is a question of peace in Ukraine and cessation of deaths, then I am ready to meet with anyone.""",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ukraine-pleads-for-weapons-as-fight-looms-on-eastern-front/article65299899.ece

514,"April 07, 2022",22:23 IST,news,international,Defiant Trump defends actions during US Capitol assault,"  Former President Donald Trump defended his conduct during the U.S. Capitol assault in an incendiary interview published Thursday, saying he did not regret summoning his rioting supporters to Washington. He told The Washington Post he would have accompanied his ultra-loyal followers as they marched on the complex on January 6 last year, but was stopped by his security detail.  He offered no contrition for whipping up the crowd with bogus claims that victory was stolen from him through widespread fraud — although he was clear in his condemnation of the violence that ensued.  ""Secret Service said I couldn't go. I would have gone there in a minute,"" he said, in the wide-ranging interview, adding that it was the largest crowd he had ever spoken to.  Thousands of Mr. Trump's supporters stormed the Capitol last year in an effort to halt the peaceful transfer of power after Joe Biden won a decisive victory in 2020, described by the government as one of the most secure elections in U.S. history.  Mr. Trump repeatedly boasted about the ""tremendous"" size of the crowd at his rally ahead of the riot and glossed over his explosive rhetoric that whipped up the crowd. ""I don't know what that means, but you see very few pictures. They don't want to show pictures, the fake news doesn't want to show pictures,"" he said.  The ex-president defended his long silence during the attack, deflecting blame to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, even though she isn't responsible for policing at the Capitol and was a target of the mob herself.  He also pointed a finger at Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser, who ""furiously tried to reach Trump's team that day,"" according to the Post. ""I hated seeing it. I hated seeing it. And I said, 'It's got to be taken care of,' and I assumed they were taking care of it,"" Mr. Trump said of the violence, which has been linked to at least five deaths.

515,"April 07, 2022",22:11 IST,news,international,Yemen president cedes powers to council as ceasefire holds," Yemen's president said Thursday he is handing his powers to a new leadership council, in a major shake-up in the coalition battling Houthi rebels as a fragile ceasefire takes hold. But Huthi spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam dismissed the move as ""a desperate attempt to rearrange the ranks of the mercenaries"" fighting in Yemen, and said peace would only come once foreign forces leave. President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi made the announcement in a televised statement on the final day of Yemen talks held in the Saudi capital Riyadh. ""I irreversibly delegate to this presidential leadership council my full powers,"" he said. Saudi Arabia said it welcomed Hadi's announcement and pledged $3 billion in aid and support for its war-torn neighbour, some of it to be paid by the United Arab Emirates. Hadi's internationally recognised government has been locked in conflict with the Iran-backed Huthis, who control the capital Sanaa and most of the north despite a Saudi-led military intervention launched in 2015. Hadi has been based in Saudi Arabia since fleeing to the kingdom that year as rebel forces closed in on his last redoubt, the southern port city of Aden. A United Nations-brokered truce that took effect last Saturday — the first day of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan — has offered a glimmer of hope in the conflict which has triggered what the UN calls the world's worst humanitarian crisis. The truce came as discussions on Yemen were unfolding in Riyadh without the participation of the Huthis, who refused to attend talks on ""enemy"" territory. ""The path to peace is by stopping the aggression, lifting the siege, and taking the foreign forces out of the country,"" said Abdulsalam, the Huthi spokesman.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/yemen-president-cedes-powers-to-council-as-ceasefire-holds/article65300330.ece

The continental powerhouse has maintained a non-aligned stance, touting negotiation as the best option to end the conflict despite international outrage and condemnation.

517,"April 07, 2022",21:51 IST,news,international,UN General Assembly votes to suspend Russia from Human Rights Council; India abstains from vote," Russia’s membership to the Human Rights Council (HRC), to which it was elected in 2020, was suspended on Thursday after the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) voted, 93 to 24, with 58 abstentions, including India, to adopt a resolution suspending Moscow from the UN body.  The resolution, ‘Suspension of the rights of membership of the Russian Federation in the Human Rights Council’ , was proposed by a group of countries that included Ukraine, the U.S., the EU, several Latin American countries and required a two-thirds majority of those present and voting for adoption. Abstentions do not count in the tally of those ‘present and voting’. India abstained for reasons of “substance and process”, its Permanent Representative to the U.N. (UNPR), T.S. Tirumurti said. “We firmly believe that all decisions should be taken fully respecting due process as all our democratic polity and structures enjoin us to do so. This applies to international organisations as well, particularly the United Nations,” Mr. Tirumurti said during his ‘Explanation of Vote’ speech at the UNGA. The U.S. , which has had uneven relationship with the HRC itself (having quit it under the Trump administration only to rejoin it last year) had been a driving force behind the resolution.  “If India has chosen any side, it is the side of peace. And it is for an immediate end to violence,” Mr. Tirumurti said, calling for diplomacy and reiterating India’s message to the UN Security council earlier this week: that the murder of civilians in the Bucha suburb of Kyiv was “deeply disturbing” and that India “unequivocally condemned” them. India, however, has refrained from blaming Russia for these murders.  The New York Times had reported earlier this week that its analysis of satellite images showed that the bodies of civlians, some with hands bound behind their backs, were present before the Russians withdrew from the area — and were not planted there - as Moscow has said — after Russian troops withdrew. The German government had satellite information implicating Russians in the killing of civilians in Bucha, Reuters reported. Moscow has denied that Russian troops were behind the deaths.  Mr. Tirumurti called for an early resolution of the conflict saying its impact was being felt beyond the region — such as via rising food and energy prices.  Thursday’s UNGA action was India’s third abstention on votes regarding the HRC. The first two abstentions were around the setting up of a Commission of Inquiry, on March 4, to look into violations of human rights and international law in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Thursday’s resolution sought the suspension of Russia from the HRC, and accused Moscow of “gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights”. The HRC is a UN body, comprising 47 states, that describes itself as “responsible for the promotion and protection of all human rights around the globe”. Countries are elected for three-year terms.   Several countries opposed the resolution on the grounds that it had been put to vote before an independent inquiry had presented its findings. Some countries, like India, were of the view that adopting the resolution would violate due process and impact the credibility of the organisation. In addition to the Commission of Inquiry established on March 4, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, as well as various U.N. countries, including India, had called for an independent inquiry into the brutal killing of civilians in the Bucha suburb of Kyiv. Speaking before the vote, South Africa’s UNPR said the draft resolution of Thursday was  “premature and prejudges the outcomes of the commission of inquiry”. Brazil was also of the view that the inquiry must first be completed. Both countries abstained during the vote. Countries in India’s neighbourhood — Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh and the Maldives — abstained. China, a member of the Council and itself accused of systematic and extensive abuses against its Uighur Muslim minority, voted against the resolution, citing, among its reasons, a lack of proper consultation prior to the vote and the risk that the move would exacerbate the conflict.  “The vote at the UNGA was difficult for India as it subverts and short circuits the whole Human Rights Council-led process,” former Indian UNPR Asoke Mukerji said, adding that India’s vote would not please either side of the conflict. “On the one hand its abstention would please neither Russia, nor would it suffice for the U.S., and on the other India will be asked to do more in terms of peace initiatives to end the Ukraine crisis.

518,"April 07, 2022",19:19 IST,news,international,"As currency plunges, Sri Lanka braces for more shortages this month"," The plunging Sri Lankan rupee, a political stalemate, and the coming holiday season, are threatening to further stall imports and impair supplies in the island nation battling one of its worst economic downturns.  On Thursday, the Sri Lankan rupee hit a new record low at 310 (roughly ₹ 79) to a US dollar officially, signalling a steep fall in the span of a month. The buying and selling rates on the black market are about 400, according to traders.  Although the Sri Lankan rupee has been declining in value since the pandemic hit in 2020, it began dropping rapidly after March 7, when the Central Bank of Sri Lanka devalued it from LKR 200 to 230 against the American dollar, to allow for ""greater flexibility"" in exchange rate. The move was also deemed necessary to obtain support from the International Monetary Fund.  “In fact, the Sri Lankan rupee has been hitting a record low every day after that,” said Nisthar Cassim, Editor of the Colombo-based business newspaper Daily Financial Times. The rupee is “still struggling to find its level in the market”, he observed, pointing to dwindling inflows by way of worker remittances, and larger bilateral borrowings that are yet to materialise.  For months now, Sri Lanka is grappling with severe shortages and high inflation amid an aggravating forex crisis. Citizens and professionals are taking to the streets in large numbers every day, in a show of rare, nation-wide public outrage against the Rajapaksa administration. On Sunday, cabinet ministers and top officials stepped down, amid the massive wave of protests demanding that the President and the ruling clan immediately quit office for “failing” the country.  Already in the grip of an economic meltdown, Sri Lanka now faces a political conundrum, with President Gotabaya Rajapaksa refusing to resign despite mounting calls, and the Opposition rejecting his offer to form a national cabinet under him.  It is this political impasse that is making the rupee plunge further this week, Mr. Cassim contended. As of Thursday, Sri Lanka does not have a Finance Minister, among other key ministers and officials, following the spate of recent resignations.  “Given this political instability and market uncertainty, exporters are putting off conversion, and it’s a double whammy for importers to cope with the sliding rupee and to actually find dollars which are not easily available,” he told The Hindu. The importers’ challenge, he anticipates, would soon translate to a severe shortage of essentials from food to medicines. “This is only the beginning of the shortages and high prices, as the rupee will remain under growing pressure.”  The government has declared April 11 and 12 as public holidays, ahead of the Sinhala and Tamil New Year holidays, one of the biggest festivals in Sri Lanka, effectively shutting down the country for the whole of next week. Traders and citizens fear the move might further impact supplies.  On Thursday, leading exporters, importers, and traders in Sri Lanka wrote to the Parliamentary Speaker, party leaders and lawmakers, seeking urgent action to avert a “economic catastrophe”. They sought political stability by the end of the week, and “a pragmatic interim solution” from sitting MPs along with the executive branch to address the concerns of citizens that has led to a massive public uprising, the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce said in a statement.  The Parliament convened on Thursday, as legislators debated the crisis for the second day. While those left in government – 42 MPs are sitting separately – sought to defend its moves, opposition MPs slammed the President for his crisis response.

The tweet, which has since been deleted, appeared to show people preparing to shoot a film, with the words ""Film set, Bucha town"" written above the image. The embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It is the third time in as many weeks that Paris has called in the envoy. The embassy previously posted a picture depicting a body lying on a table called ""Europe"" with characters representing the United States and European Union jabbing needles into it. “In the face of the indecency and provocation of the communication of the Russian embassy in France on the acts perpetrated in Bucha, I have decided to summon .... the ambassador of Russia,” Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said in a statement. President Emmanuel Macron has sought to keep dialogue with Russian President Vladimir Putin. He speaks regularly with Mr. Putin as part of efforts to get a ceasefire and begin a credible negotiation between Kyiv and Moscow. Mr. Macron has faced criticism for maintaining that channel. The French Presidency says the contact is at the request of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Bucha, 37km (23 miles) northwest of Kyiv, was occupied by Russian troops for more than a month following the February 24 invasion of Ukraine.

520,"April 07, 2022",17:45 IST,news,international,Sanctions on Putin’s daughters recall defection of Svetlana Stalin and burden of patronym," On Wednesday, the United States government, in a renewed round of sanctions, extended them to the two daughters of Russian president Vladimir Putin - Katerina Tikhonova and Maria Vorontsova. Little is known of the two ladies, but the extension of sanctions to them and the end of the unipolar post-Cold War world order due to the Russian attack on Ukraine, has evoked memories of an incident involving another daughter of a Russian leader that took place during the height of the Cold War - the defection of Svetlana Alliluyeva, daughter of Josef Stalin, in March 1967 to the U.S., the defection taking place from New Delhi.  While Ms Tikhonova and Ms. Vorontsova's cases are different from that of Alliluyeva- neither of Mr. Putin's daughters have reportedly any intention to defect or denounce their father, who is still the supreme leader of Russia, while Stalin had by then been deceased for over a decade - the tangled history of the defection with India as the site of it still makes for an interesting story.  According to the biography of Alliluyeva (Svetlana had taken on the name of her mother's family) by Rosemary Sullivan, Stalin's Daughter - The Extraordinary and Tumultuous Life of Svetlana Alliluyeva"", Stalin's daughter had had a hot and cold relationship with her father, losing many relatives to the frequent purges undertaken by him. After his death, she felt that she was being treated like a ""national relic"" or government property.  In the mid 1960s, she had met and fallen in love with Brajesh Singh, leader of the Communist Party of India, belonging to the royal family of Kalakankar near Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh and nephew of then Minister in the Indian government Dinesh Singh. Though the two fell in love, the Soviet authorities refused Alliluyeva permission to marry him. They, however, lived together till Singh, in Moscow for treatment of a lung ailment, passed away in 1966. Her trip to India, was ostensibly to immerse his ashes in the Ganga as per Hindu rituals, and she was reluctantly given permission to visit the country. She had two children from a previous marriage who she left behind in Russia.  On March 6, 1967, three months into her trip and on the verge of her return to the Soviet Union, then 41-year-old Alliluyeva walked into the U.S. embassy in New Delhi as the Soviet mission was hosting a cocktail party. She had, the previous year itself, managed to smuggle out the manuscript of her memoirs, Twenty Letters to a Friend, via then Indian envoy in Moscow T.N. Kaul, and was carrying it with her.  Needless to say there was consternation in the U.S. embassy with this high-profile defector at their doorstep, with then Consul George Huey reportedly asking her, ""So you say your father was Stalin? The Stalin?"" It took a few hours to determine whether the U.S. wanted the international incident to occur with not just the Soviet Union but also the Indian government, which would be upset at having been caught in the midst of the Cold War tangle.  According to Ms. Sullivan's book, Danny Rayle, then second secretary in the U.S. embassy, took his own time to verify her identity and was amazed that she had managed to get her passport from the Soviet authorities who had assumed she would return to Moscow in a couple of days. In the midst of it, she recalled that she was due for a dinner party at Kaul's residence, she called Preeti Kaul, his daughter, to make her excuses. This was also a test put by the Americans to verify whether she was who she claimed she was.  Ambassador Chester Bowles and his then special assistant, Richard Celeste, then cabled Washington, stating that unless advised to the contrary, they were spiriting Alliluyeva on a Qantas flight to the U.S. with a stopover in Rome. It was only when they were mid-air that Washington cabled back with misgivings over the caper, and Alliyuleva had to cool her heels in Switzerland for months before her case was decided.  Alliluyeva’s future life in the U.S. was also tumultuous, but Ms. Sullivan writes that she bore it with a laconic humour and reports her as having said: “I don’t any longer have the pleasant illusion that I can be free of the label ‘Stalin’s daughter’.... you can’t regret your fate, though I do regret my mother didn’t marry a carpenter.”",Nistula Hebbar,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sanctions-on-putins-daughters-recall-defection-of-svetlana-stalin-and-burden-of-patronym/article65299297.ece
521,"April 07, 2022",17:04 IST,news,international,Anil Kumble felt he was unfairly treated: Ex-CoA chief Vinod Rai writes on Kohli-Kumble controversy in his book," Anil Kumble felt that he was treated ""unfairly"" and forced to resign as head coach of the Indian team but then skipper Virat Kohli opined that players were not happy with his ""intimidating"" style of enforcing discipline, according to former Committee of Administrators head Vinod Rai.  In his recently published book ‘Not Just A Nightwatchman: My Innings with BCCI’, published by ‘Rupa’, Rai touched upon various issues that he dealt with during his 33-month tenure.  One of the issues and perhaps the most controversial, was when Kohli complained about his breakdown of relationship with Kumble, who announced his resignation publicly just after Champions Trophy in 2017.  Kumble was handed a one-year contract in 2016.  ""In my conversations with the captain and team management, it was conveyed that Kumble was too much of a disciplinarian and hence the team members were not too happy with him,"" Rai has written in his book.  ""I had spoken to Virat Kohli on the issue and he did mention that the younger members of the team felt intimidated by the way he worked with them.""   Rai reveals that the then Cricket Advisory Committee comprising Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, VVS Laxman had recommended Kumble's re-appointment.  ""Soon, the CAC met in London and interacted with the two separately in a bid to resolve the issue. After deliberations over three days, they decided to recommend Kumble's reappointment as the head coach."" However it was evident from what followed was that Kohli's point of view was given more respect and hence Kumble's position became untenable.  ""We had long conversations with Kumble after he had returned from the UK. He was obviously upset about the manner in which the entire episode had panned out. He felt he had been unfairly treated and a captain or team should not be given so much importance.  ""It was the duty of the coach to bring discipline and professionalism into the team and as a senior, his views should have been respected by the players."" Rai also wrote that Kumble felt that more credence was given to following protocols and process and less emphasis was laid on how the team performed under his guidance.  ""He was disappointed that we had given such importance to following process, and that, in view of the team's performance over the previous year, he deserved an extension."" Rai had further written that he had explained to Kumble as to why he didn't get an extension.  ""I explained to him that considering the fact that even his earlier selection in 2016 had followed a process, and that his one-year contract had no extension clause, we were bound to follow process, even for his reappointment. And that is exactly what was done."" Rai however found it mature and prudent on both Kohli and Kumble's part to maintain a dignified silence on the issue or else the controversy would have continued.  ""It is indeed very prudent of captain Kohli to have maintained a dignified silence. Any utterance from him would have set off a fusillade of opinions.  ""Kumble, on his part, too, kept to himself and did not go public on any issue that had transpired. That was the most mature and dignified manner of dealing with a situation which could have become unpleasant for all parties involved.""  In 2017, when Ravi Shastri was reappointed as head coach (earlier he was Cricket Director), the BCCI had in its initial mail stated that Rahul Dravid and Zaheer Khan were appointed batting and bowling consultants respectively.  However the decision had to be overturned and later Shastri's right-hand man and confidante Bharat Arun was also reinstated as bowling coach.  Rai, in his book, mentioned that there were practical difficulties which led to Dravid and Zaheer not being able to take up the role.  ""Laxman called to say that news reports were emerging that the CoA had reportedly given the impression that the CAC had exceeded its remit in recommending Dravid and Zaheer as consultant/coach.  ""He called to convey the 'pain of the CAC'. I assured him that these were media speculations and somebody was quite unnecessarily adding his unsolicited two bits to the process."" ""The fact remained that Dravid was far too occupied with the U-19 team to spare time for the senior team. Zaheer was contracted with another team and could not have been engaged. And hence that recommendation could not be acted upon. That put the lid on the process,"" he wrote.  However Rai's recollection for all those who had covered the issue back then, seems a bit inaccurate.  ""Had they known that Dravid and Zaheer would be unable to take up, why would have Rai sanctioned their appointments,"" a senior official, who was active back then told PTI.  ""The truth is that Shastri, after his appointment had made it clear that he would only work when his choice of support staff is given and that roster needs to have Bharat Arun,"" the official added. While Rai is absolutely spot on in mentioning that it was Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who recommended an A+ category in the central contracts, the figures mentioned on page 36 of the book do not match with reality.  ""As per the suggestion of team management, we devised four categories, A+, A, B and C, and the remuneration contemplated was '8 crore, 7 crore, 5 crore and 3 crore, respectively."" However, the BCCI's Centrally contracted cricketers get Rs 7 crore (A+), Rs 5 crore (A), Rs 3 crore (B group) and Rs 1 crore (group C).  A factual error noted in the book is England all-rounder Ben Stokes' salary which Rai has quoted as $4 million (Page 71) for eight weeks.  ""Another remarkable example has been that of Ben Stokes. He was barred from playing due to some infractions not related to cricket. That seemed not to have caused him too much of consternation as he earned $4 million in the IPL, and that too for a mere eight-week engagement,"" he wrote.  However it must be mentioned that Stokes was bought by Rajasthan Royals for $2.16 million (£1.63 million) and not for the amount mentioned in the book.

Since a military-led coup ousted Aung San Suu Kyi's administration last year, Myanmar has been increasingly isolated internationally — with foreign governments urging an end to deadly crackdowns on mass democracy protests.  Australia's outgoing ambassador Andrea Faulkner met with junta leader Min Aung Hlaing in Naypyidaw on Wednesday, with state-owned media outlet  Global New Light of Myanmar reporting the pair discussed ""enhancement of cooperation in various sectors"".  The ambassador was accompanied by Australia's defence attache to Myanmar, Colonel Tony Egan, the report said. Katrina Cooper from Australia's Foreign Affairs Department said the ambassador had used the meeting to reiterate calls for Myanmar to cease violence and release detainees.  ""The Australian government does not consider that the outgoing meeting legitimises the current regime,"" Ms. Cooper told a Senate committee in Canberra. But HRW said the meeting and subsequent coverage in state media did just that.  ""This is meeting is not only deeply unacceptable, but it undercuts efforts by other governments to isolate the military commander implicated in serious abuses,"" HRW's Myanmar researcher Manny Maung said. ""By taking photo ops and accepting gifts, Australia only serves to lend credibility to a military junta that is accused of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity against its own population."" Ms. Maung urged Australia to ""align with its traditional allies"" by avoiding further high-level meetings with the junta and immediately imposing sanctions.  Australian officials outlined seven other meetings and phone calls with the junta since the coup, but denied any sectors were engaging with the regime. Canberra has repeatedly called for the release of Australian economist Sean Turnell, who was working as an adviser to Suu Kyi when he was detained shortly after the coup.  He has been charged with violating Myanmar's official secrets law and faces a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison if found guilty. Myanmar has been in chaos since a putsch in February 2021, with more than 1,700 people killed in crackdowns on dissent, according to a local monitoring group.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/australia-myanmar-junta-meeting-unacceptable-human-rights-watch/article65299123.ece

Minutes later, President Ari Alvi dissolved the National Assembly on the advice of Prime Minister Khan who had effectively lost the majority. Chief Justice Bandial, who is heading a five-member Bench comprising Justices Ijazul Ahsan, Mohammad Ali Mazhar Miankhel, Munib Akhtar and Jamal Khan Mandokhel, declared as unconstitutional the controversial ruling by the Deputy Speaker. In a unanimous verdict, the Bench also declared dissolution of Parliament as unconstitutional. The Bench restored Parliament and declared the advice by Mr. Khan to President Alvi to dissolve the Assembly as unconstitutional. The court ordered the Speaker to call the session of the Assembly on April 9 at 10 a.m. to organise the no-confidence vote. The Opposition has said it has 172 votes in the 340-seat House to oust Mr. Khan, after several members of his own party and a key coalition partner defected. Security in and around the apex court was beefed up. Riot police forces were deployed outside the court building. During the hearing, Chief Justice Bandial noted that the Deputy Speaker's ruling was prima facie a violation of Article 95. Apart from leading lawyers representing various parties, the court called at the rostrum Shehbaz Sharif, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz president and main opposition leader, and asked about his view on the way forward in the wake of uncertainty due to the dissolution of the Assembly and announcement of fresh elections. Mr. Shehbaz said how could the opposition leaders take part in the election after being labelled as “traitors”. He left it to the court to decide but urged that rule of law should be adhered to and added that “we cannot face even our families after being called as traitors”. He was referring to the ruling by the Deputy Speaker that the no-confidence motion was linked to a so-called ""foreign conspiracy"". With the court ruling against the Deputy Speaker, Parliament is likely to reconvene and hold the no-confidence vote against Mr. Khan. The latest political chaos has spilled over to the country's largest province of Punjab, where 60% of Pakistan's 220 million people live and where Mr. Khan's ally for chief provincial minister was denied the post on Wednesday, after his political opposition voted in their own candidate.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pakistan-supreme-court-reinstates-national-assembly-rules-no-trust-vote-against-imran-khan-government-will-go-ahead/article65299090.ece
524,"April 07, 2022",14:22 IST,news,international,Slaying of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi | Turkey suspends trial of Saudi suspects," A Turkish court ruled on April 7 to suspend the trial in absentia of 26 Saudis accused in the gruesome killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi and for the case to be transferred to Saudi Arabia. The decision comes despite warnings from human rights groups that turning the case over to the kingdom would lead to a cover up of the killing which has cast suspicion on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It also comes as Turkey, which is in the throes of an economic downturn, has been trying to repair its troubled relationship with Saudi Arabia and an array of other countries in its region. Some media reports have claimed that Riyadh has made improved relations conditional on Turkey dropping the case against the Saudis. Last week, the prosecutor in the case recommended that the case be transferred to the kingdom, arguing that the trial in Turkey would remain inconclusive. Turkey’s Justice Minister supported the recommendation, adding that the trial in Turkey would resume if the Turkish court is not satisfied with the outcome of proceedings in the kingdom. It was not clear however, if Saudi Arabia, which has already put some of the defendants on trial behind closed door, would open a new trial.  Human rights advocates had urged Turkey not to transfer the case to Saudi Arabia. “By transferring the case of a murder that was committed on its territory, Turkey will be knowingly and willingly sending the case back into the hands of those who bare its responsibility,” said Amnesty International’s Secretary General Agnes Callamard. “Indeed, the Saudi system has repeatedly failed to cooperate with the Turkish prosecutor and it is clear that justice cannot be delivered by a Saudi court.” “What has happened to Turkey’s declared commitment that justice must prevail for this gruesome murder and that this case would never become a pawn in political calculations and interest?” she asked. The New York-based Human Rights Watch said: “Given the complete lack of judicial independence in Saudi Arabia, the role of the Saudi government in Khashoggi’s killing, its past attempts at obstructing justice, and a criminal justice system that fails to satisfy basic standards of fairness, chances of a fair trial for the Khashoggi case in Saudi Arabia are close to nil.”  Kaghoggi, a United States resident who wrote for the Washington Post, was killed on October 2, 2018, at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, where he had gone for an appointment to collect documents required for him to marry his Turkish fiancee, Hatice Cengiz.  Turkish officials allege that Khashoggi, who wrote critically about the crown prince, was killed and then dismembered with a bone saw inside the consulate by a team of Saudi agents sent to Istanbul. The group included a forensic doctor, intelligence and security officers and individuals who worked for the crown prince’s office.

525,"April 07, 2022",13:17 IST,news,international,Reconsider travel to Sri Lanka: U.S. cautions its citizens amid Sri Lankan economic crisis," The United States has advised its citizens against travelling to Sri Lanka, pointing to the fuel and medicine shortages, as well as the COVID-19 and terror threats in the Island nation where the worst-ever economic crisis has triggered political unrest.  Sri Lanka is facing its worst economic crisis since gaining independence from the U.K. in 1948.  Sri Lankans have protested for weeks over lengthy power cuts and shortages of gas, food and other basic goods. The public anger has prompted nearly all Cabinet ministers to quit, and scores of lawmakers to leave President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's government.  “Reconsider travel to Sri Lanka due to COVID-19 and fuel and medicine shortages. Exercise increased caution in Sri Lanka due to terrorism,” the State Department said on Wednesday in its latest travel advisory which has now been placed on Level 3.  The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a Level 3 Travel Health Notice for Sri Lanka due to Coronavirus, indicating a high level of COVID-19 in the country.  “Your risk of contracting COVID-19 and developing severe symptoms may be lower if you are fully vaccinated with an FDA-authorised vaccine. Before planning any international travel, please review the CDC's specific recommendations for vaccinated and unvaccinated travellers,” it said.  The State Department said Sri Lanka is experiencing shortages of fuel and cooking gas as well as some medicines and essential food items, due to the ongoing economic situation in the country. There have recently been protests over the economic situation and queues at gas stations, grocery stores, and some pharmacies. Protests have occurred throughout the country and have mostly been peaceful. In some instances, police have used water cannons and tear gas to disperse protesters,” it said. “There have also been daily planned power outages across the island, as well as some unplanned power outages, as fuel for backup generators is increasingly scarce. Public transportation in some instances has been limited or curtailed. Travellers should monitor local media for updates on the ongoing situation,” said the State Department. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets, shopping malls, government facilities, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, parks, major sporting and cultural events, educational institutions, airports, hospitals, and other public areas, the travel advisory said. Despite the declaration of a state of emergency and a weekend curfew, people joined the protests calling for the resignation of Rajapaksa throughout the island nation on Tuesday. Protesters even blocked the access roads to parliament.  The President late Tuesday night revoked the emergency after huge public protests demanded his resignation.  The president and his older brother, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, continue to hold power in Sri Lanka, despite their politically powerful family being the focus of public ire.  President Rajapaksa has defended his government's actions, saying the foreign exchange crisis was not his making and the economic downturn was largely pandemic driven with the island nation’s tourism revenue and inward remittances waning.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-cautions-its-citizens-against-travelling-to-sri-lanka/article65298820.ece
526,"April 07, 2022",12:57 IST,news,international,Spain PM Pedro Sánchez in Morocco to mend ties after Western Sahara shift," Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez is set to meet with Moroccan King Mohammed VI on April 7 during a two-day visit to Rabat that seeks to mark an easing of diplomatic tensions centred on Morocco's disputed region of Western Sahara. The King will invite Mr. Sánchez and his family to share in the Iftar meal to break the day’s fast during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, according to a Spanish government official not authorised to be named in media reports. Spain’s government calls the meeting an opportunity to open a “new stage” in ties with Morocco based on “mutual respect,” but also to discuss ""restraint from any unilateral action to honour the importance of all that we share and to avoid future crises.” Relations between the two countries separated by the Strait of Gibraltar were severely frayed last April. Morocco was angered by Spain allowing the leader of the pro-independence movement for Western Sahara to receive medical treatment for COVID-19 at a Spanish hospital on request by Morocco's neighbour Algeria, an ally of pro-independence Sahrawis. Morocco responded by loosening its border controls around Spain’s North Africa enclave of Ceuta, provoking the unauthorised crossing of thousands of young Moroccans and migrants from other African countries. The mood did not improve until last month, when Mr. Sánchez took the surprising decision to alter Spain’s long-standing position on Western Sahara, a former Spanish colony. In a letter to King Mohammed, Mr. Sánchez backed Morocco’s plan to give more autonomy to Western Sahara as long as it remains unquestionably under Moroccan grip. The Spanish leader called Rabat’s proposal “the most serious, realistic and credible” initiative for resolving the decades-long dispute over the vast territory — that’s largely barren but rich in phosphates and faces fertile fishing grounds in the Atlantic Ocean — which Morocco annexed in 1976. Morocco, in turn, sent back its ambassador to Spain 10 months after he was recalled. Morocco is now seeking assurances that Spain’s support for the autonomy proposal is a strategic shift in its foreign policy. King Mohammed said last year that his country will not sign any economic partnerships with countries that oppose Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara. Morocco has grown in strategic importance to Spain over the past decade. Rabat is considered critical both in the fight against radical jihadi groups as well as in holding back increasing numbers of African migrants who want to reach Europe as they flee violence and poverty. Mr. Sánchez and Spanish Foreign Minister José Albares have insisted that Spain continues to support the resolution of the Western Sahara question via a United Nations-backed referendum. But the drive to appease Morocco has earned Mr. Sánchez sharp criticism both in Madrid and in Algiers.  His Socialist Party has received no backing from any other party in Spain’s Parliament, not even the junior member in the government coalition, for the tilt toward Rabat. Its political opponents accuse Mr. Sánchez of having betrayed the Sahrawi people while getting nothing tangible in return from Morocco. Mr. Sánchez has responded that he has worked with Spain's national interest in mind. Now, he is under pressure to show real results. Potentially even more problematic for Mr. Sánchez is the damage to relations with Algeria, which has recalled its ambassador to Spain in a sign of its continued support for the Western Sahara independence movement. Spain, while having a relatively low dependence on natural gas imports compared to other European Union countries, receives gas from Algeria via a pipeline and tankers carrying liquefied natural gas.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/spain-pm-pedro-snchez-in-morocco-to-mend-ties-after-western-sahara-shift/article65298790.ece

Residents in several suburbs of Sydney's south and southwest were told to leave for safety as fast-flowing rivers rose. ""We have seen exceptionally sharp, short bursts of rain that have created significant flash flooding events around parts of the Illawarra,"" New South Wales State Emergency Service Deputy Commissioner Daniel Austin said. ""We ask the community to continue to be vigilant. This is a highly dynamic situation. These events are moving exceptionally quickly."" Images from around Sydney showed submerged roads, cars struggling through floodwaters and debris flowing rapidly down rivers. Woronora resident Belinda told national broadcaster ABC that the river was flowing faster than she had ever seen. ""A little nervous, our property's up quite high so it's not much danger of us being flooded but for those properties that are a bit lower, it's a real worry,"" she said. Major flood warnings were issued for several suburbs in the south of Sydney, while the entire city of five million was warned of potential flash flooding into the weekend. NSW emergency services said they had responded to more than 680 calls for help from people affected by the weather so far. The deluge is the latest to hit the region and comes less than a week after huge waves pummelled the coastline, with surf swallowing entire beaches including the famous sands of Bondi. Large parts of Australia's east coast have been inundated by heavy rain for months. Residents in the hardest-hit areas are still recovering from floods that swept through in March.

528,"April 07, 2022",10:34 IST,news,international,White House warns of ‘escalating vulnerabilities’ to U.S. from semiconductor shortage,"  The White House held a
classified briefing on Wednesday with some U.S. lawmakers on the
dire risks to the American economy from semiconductor supply
chain issues as it pushes Congress for $52 billion in funding to
subsidise production. (Sign up to our Technology newsletter, Today’s Cache, for insights on emerging themes at the intersection of technology, business and policy. Click here to subscribe for free.) White House National Economic Council Director Brian Deese
told reporters ""the best estimates are the lack of available
semiconductors probably took a full percentage point off of GDP
in 2021."" The briefing included Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo,
Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks, National Security
Advisor Jake Sullivan to ""discuss the urgent need to invest in
made-in-America semiconductors as well as research and
development that will protect our economic and national
security,"" the White House said. A persistent industry-wide shortage of chips has disrupted
production in the automotive and electronics industries, forcing
some firms to scale back production. There have been growing
calls to decrease reliance on other countries for
semiconductors. ""A significant interruption to our supply of semiconductors
could cause historic damage to the U.S. economy – damage far
greater than the impact of chips shortages on the American auto
industry right now – and would undercut our technological
competitiveness and military advantages over adversaries
globally,"" the White House said. The White House has been pushing Congress to approve
U.S. subsidies for semiconductor chips manufacturing after
months of discussions. The Senate first passed $52 billion in chips funding in June
that also authorised $190 billion to strengthen U.S. technology
and research to compete with China, while the House of
Representatives passed its version in early February. Deese said
he hopes both the Senate and House will appoint negotiators this
week to ""quickly"" begin a formal process to finalise a
compromise bill. ""The risks are profound,"" Deese said of what would the U.S.
economy face with a severe disruption. Deese cited ""economic
moves by key competitors - most notably China around the
escalating vulnerabilities we have from the semiconductor
issue."" A Commerce Department analysis that was prepared for the
briefing seen by Reuters noted semiconductor fabs take years to
construct. ""There is no quick fix in the face of emergency,"" it said,
adding private sector investment in U.S. chips production is not
enough and ""will not be sufficient to mitigate the risks
associated with the current U.S. supply chain vulnerabilities."" The bills take different approaches to addressing U.S.competitiveness with China on a wide range of issues, as well on
trade and some climate provisions. The Biden administration notes the United States produced
nearly 40% of all chips in 1990 while today it accounts for only
12% of global production.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/white-house-warns-of-escalating-vulnerabilities-to-us-from-semiconductor-shortage/article65298570.ece
529,"April 07, 2022",10:30 IST,news,international,Realism versus liberalism in international relations," Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has rekindled the realism versus liberalism debate in international relations. While liberals in general call the war an attack by “authoritarian Russia” on “democratic Ukraine”, realists argue the war was the culmination of the post-Cold War power games in Europe. While this debate can go on with no consensus, it’s important to understand the basic tenets of the two theories that are fuelling it. Basically, both theories try to understand the behaviour of states, especially great powers, from different perspectives. Liberalism broadly has three core beliefs: states are the main actors in the international system; the internal characteristics of each state vary from the other and these differences shape the state’s behaviour; and some governance models are good and some are bad (for example, democracies versus dictatorships).  After the end of the Cold War, in which the liberal West defeated the communist Soviet Union, Francis Fukuyama, in The End of History and the Last Man, called the western liberal democracy the final form of human government. So, liberals emphasise on the internal characteristics of states which, they argue, impact states’ external policies. According to them, good states are supposed to make peace while bad states could seek to expand their power at the expense of others. Within the liberal framework, there are three different but interconnected theoretical approaches — economic interdependence, democratic peace and international institutions. The proponents of economic interdependence argue that a liberal economic order is essential for a stable international order. Economic globalisation is intrinsically linked to this argument. Democratic peace theorists claim that democracies do not go to war with each other. So, to create a world without war, according to this theory, a world of democracies should be built. And the role of institutions, according to them, is critical to maintain peace and order in the global system.  The League of Nations was formed after the First World War. The League collapsed and the Second World War broke out. But the post-War world order was rebuilt with new international institutions starting with the United Nations. Therefore, the ideal world order that liberals want is the one where democratic states are connected through economic globalisation and function in a system that is regulated by international organisations. While liberalism offers an optimistic view of the global order, it’s more about what the world ought to be. Realism is more about what the world is.  For realists, a peaceful global order is desirable, but that’s far from reality. Hence, they are pessimists. Realists, like liberals, also consider nation states as the primary actors in the international system. For them, the world is basically an anarchic place with no supreme authority to maintain order. Therefore, this makes the world a dangerous place. As historian E.H. Carr notes, realism “tends to emphasise the irresistible strength of existing forces and the inevitable character of existing tendencies, and to insist that the highest wisdom lies in accepting, and adapting oneself to these forces and these tendencies”. There are three main streams of realist theory in international relations — human nature realism, defensive realism and offensive realism. And all streams seek to explain why states seek more power.  Human nature realism (also called classical realism), laid out by Hans Morgenthau in Politics Among Nations, is based on the argument that humans’ lust for power can have a profound impact on the nature of states as states are led by human beings.  According to human nature realists, states, by default, have this ‘will to power’ wired into them like human beings, and in an anarchic order, they continue to seek expansion of power. This could create conflicts. Defensive realists, on the other hand, don't believe that states are inherently aggressive. Kenneth Waltz argues in Theory of International Politics that the fundamental aim of states is survival. But Waltz also agrees that the global order is anarchic and this structural factor forces states to compete with each other.  Offensive realism is also a structural theory like defensive realism that bases its arguments on the structural factors rather than human behaviour. John Mearsheimer, the Chicago University professor who conceptualised offensive realism, argues that great powers always seek to maximise their power at the expense of rivals. While defensive realists argue that great powers seek to maintain the existing balance of power, offensive realists argue that status quo powers are rarely seen in international politics. “A state’s ultimate goal is to be the hegemon in the system,” writes Mearsheimer in The Tragedy of Great Power Politics.",Stanly Johny,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/realism-versus-liberalism-in-international-relations/article65296469.ece
530,"April 07, 2022",09:13 IST,news,international,Why the U.S. is targeting Putin’s daughters Katerina and Maria,"  The United States’ latest round of sanctions on Russia includes two new targets: Russian President Vladimir Putin’s two adult daughters, Katerina and Maria, who U.S. officials believe are hiding Putin’s wealth. Putin’s daughter Katerina Vladimirovna Tikhonova is a tech executive whose work supports the Russian government and its defense industry, according to details in the U.S. sanctions package announced on Wednesday. His other daughter Maria Vladimirovna Vorontsova leads government-funded programs that have received billions of dollars from the Kremlin toward genetics research, and are personally overseen by Putin, the United States said. “We have reason to believe that Putin, and many of his cronies, and the oligarchs, hide their wealth, hide their assets, with family members that place their assets and their wealth in the U.S. financial system, and also many other parts of the world,” a senior U.S. administration official told reporters. “We believe that many of Putin’s assets are hidden with family members, and that’s why we’re targeting them,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Reuters was not immediately able to reach Putin’s daughters, their representatives or the Kremlin for comment. Sanctions announced Wednesday also include the daughter and wife of Russian foreign affairs minister Sergei Lavrov. The U.S. also banned Americans from investing in Russia, and targeted Russian financial institutions and Kremlin officials, in response to what President Joe Biden condemned as Russian “atrocities” in Ukraine. Russia denies intentionally attacking civilians and says images of bodies in Bucha north of Kyiv were staged to justify more sanctions against Moscow. Moscow says it is engaged in a “special military operation” designed to demilitarize and “denazify” Ukraine. Ukraine and Western governments reject that as a false pretext for Russia’s invasion. The extent of Putin’s wealth is a sensitive subject in Russia. The Kremlin last year denied that he was the owner of an opulent palace on the Black Sea, as alleged by opposition politician Alexei Navalny in a video that draw a huge audience on YouTube. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in February that sanctions introduced against Putin himself were pointless. “(Putin) is quite indifferent. The sanctions contain absurd claims about some assets,” Peskov said. “The president has no assets other than those he has declared.” But U.S. lawmakers believe otherwise. “Putin and his oligarchs stow their dirty money in rule-of-law nations by purchasing mansions, mega-yachts, artwork, and other high-value assets,” U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse said a few weeks ago while introducing legislation that offered cash rewards for information that leads to the seizure of assets held by sanctioned Russian oligarchs. Putin’s daughters, who the U.S. believes help him hide his wealth, have never confirmed publicly the Russian leader is their father, and he has refused to answer questions about them. A Reuters investigation from 2015 detailed the connections and influence Katerina, an acrobatic rock ’n’ roll dancer, holds in the next generation of Moscow’s elite.  “Katerina, 29, described herself as the spouse of Kirill Shamalov, son of Nikolai Shamalov, a longtime friend of President Putin,” the report said. “Shamalov senior is a shareholder in Bank Rossiya, which U.S. officials have described as the personal bank of the Russian elite.” As husband and wife, Kirill and Katerina had corporate holdings worth about $2 billion, according to estimates provided to Reuters by financial analysts. This was in addition to other property and assets. Putin’s elder daughter Maria studied biology at St. Petersburg University and medicine at Moscow State University, according to the Reuters investigation. She is also heavily involved in genetic research work, which Putin has in the past described as a field that will “determine the future of the whole world.” According to Russian and Western media reports, Maria married Dutch businessman Jorrit Joost Faassen. She was pursuing a biomedical career specializing in the endocrine system in 2015, as a doctoral candidate at the Endocrinology Research Centre in Moscow, and is the co-author of a book about “idiopathic stunting” in children, the Reuters report said. Her husband used to work for Gazprombank, a large lender with strong links to the elite around Putin, the report noted. No estimates were immediately available for their assets and holdings.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/why-the-us-is-targeting-putins-daughters-katerina-and-maria/article65298528.ece

Human Rights Council; India abstains," The United Nations General Assembly on Thursday voted on the draft resolution titled ‘Suspension of the rights of membership of the Russian Federation in the Human Rights Council’. The vote was 93-24 with 58 abstentions. Like many instances since the beginning of the war, India abstained from voting. Even as the Russian invasion of Ukranian areas continues, the mayor of the besieged city of Mariupol said that more than 5,000 civilians have been killed so far, among them 210 children. The United States announced further sanctions on Russian entities and individuals, including a ban on American investments in Russia and sanctions on the families of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.  Addressing the Lok Sabha, Union Minister of External Affairs, S. Jaishankar said that India will be “glad” to help in bringing about a resolution to the crisis in Ukraine. The conflict began escalating on February 21, 2022, after Russian President Vladimir Putin recognised separatist regions in eastern Ukraine and deployed troops in a peacekeeping role. Here are the latest updates: India on Thursday abstained in the UN General Assembly on a vote moved by the US to suspend Russia from the UN Human Rights Council over allegations that Russian soldiers killed civilians while retreating from towns near the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. The 193-member General Assembly voted Thursday on the draft resolution titled ‘Suspension of the rights of membership of the Russian Federation in the Human Rights Council’. Since January this year, India has abstained on eight occasions on procedural votes and draft resolutions in the UN Security Council, the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council that deplored Russian aggression against Ukraine. New Delhi had on Tuesday unequivocally condemned the ""deeply disturbing"" reports of civilian killings in the Ukrainian city of Bucha and supported the call for an independent investigation, as it underlined that when innocent human lives are at stake, diplomacy must prevail as the only viable option. ""The situation in Ukraine has not shown any significant improvement since the Council last discussed the issue. The security situation has only deteriorated, as well as its humanitarian consequences,"" India’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti told a meeting on Ukraine in the UN Security Council Tuesday that was addressed for the first time by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The General Assembly resumed its Emergency Special Session after a request from Antigua and Barbuda, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Georgia, Japan, Liberia, Republic of Moldova, Ukraine, United Kingdom, United States and the Head of the Delegation of the European Union, on behalf of 27 members of the European Union. The Human Rights Council consists of 47 Member States, elected directly and individually by secret ballot by the majority of the members of the General Assembly. The General Assembly, by a two-thirds majority of the members present and voting, “may suspend the rights of membership in the Council of a member of the Council that commits gross and systematic violations of human rights.” Abstentions do not count and the resolution required two-thirds of yes/no votes to be adopted. Ukraine’s president urged Europe to take a stronger stand against Russia in a video address to Greece’s parliament on Thursday that invoked the battle cry of 19th century Greek patriots in the Black Sea port of Odesa. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Mariupol, another port on Ukraine’s coast where thousands of ethic Greeks live, had been “reduced to ashes” since Russia’s invasion, and called for more humanitarian aid and efforts to evacuate those wounded. “This is a matter of honour for Europeans to answer,” he said through an interpreter, in a speech that won him a standing ovation in the Athens parliament.
The six-week-old war has forced more than 4 million people to flee Ukraine, destroyed cities and prompted a slew of Western restrictions on Russian elites and the economy. Russia has denied targeting civilians and said Ukraine and its Western backers are gripped by discriminatory anti-Russian paranoia. - Reuters Ukraine on Thursday accused its neighbour, Kremlin-ally Hungary, of appeasing Russian aggression and disrupting EU unity following a telephone call between the Hungarian and Russian leaders. “Apparently, after the elections, Budapest moved on to the next step -- helping (Russian President Vladimir) Putin continue his aggression against Ukraine,” the Ukrainian foreign ministry said in a statement, also accusing Hungary of “destroying unity in the EU”.- AFP Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy will have talks in Kyiv on Friday with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Ukrainian presidential spokesman Sergii Nykyforov said on national television. He said other details of the talks would not be announced for security reasons. A European Union spokesman said on Tuesday that the EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, would also travel to Kyiv this week.- Reuters Greece is to call on the International Criminal Court (ICC) to probe “crimes of war” in Ukraine’s port city of Mariupol, where there was a sizeable Greek community before Russia’s invasion, its foreign minister said on Thursday. “Greece is going to ask the international court in The Hague to investigate crimes of war conducted in Mariupol,” Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias said as he arrived for the second day of a NATO meeting on the war in Ukraine. “Greece has a specific, special interest for Mariupol because of the existence of a 100,000 and more Greek community in Mariupol,” he said.- AFP  The Russian defence ministry said on Thursday its missiles had destroyed four fuel storage facilities in the Ukrainian cities of Mykolayiv, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia and Chuhuiv overnight. The ministry said the facilities were used by Ukraine to supply its troops near the cities of Mykolaiv and Kharkiv and in the Donbas region in the far southeast. Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a special operation to degrade its southern neighbour’s military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists. Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions in an effort to force Russia to withdraw its forces. - Reuters  Desperate evacuation attempts from eastern Ukraine were under way Thursday as authorities warned of an imminent Russian offensive, following the devastation around Kyiv that has shocked the world. Russian troops have been withdrawing from around the capital and Ukraine’s north, leaving a trail of destruction behind them, as they prepare for an expected assault on the country’s southeast. Begging civilians to leave the region “while it is still possible”, local officials in Donbas’ Lugansk and Donetsk said the region was already facing constant indiscriminate shelling. “We can see clearly that before the enemy goes to full attack, they will just destroy places completely,” local governor Sergiy Gaiday in Lugansk told Ukrainian broadcaster Channel 24.- AFP Ukraine hopes to evacuate trapped civilians through 10 humanitarian corridors on Thursday, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said, but residents trying to leave the besieged city of Mariupol will have to use their own vehicles.- Reuters  Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on Thursday called on NATO members to provide Kyiv with all the weaponry it needs to fight Russia. “My agenda is very simple. It has only three items on it. Its weapons, weapons, and weapons,” Kuleba told journalists at NATO headquarters in Brussels. “I call on all allies to put aside their hesitations, their reluctance, to provide Ukraine with everything it needs,” he said at a meeting with alliance foreign ministers.- AFP Ukraine will keep up demands on the West for an oil and gas embargo on Russia after its invasion of the country, the Ukrainian foreign minister said on Thursday. Dmytro Kuleba also called for the dispatch of more planes, air defence systems, missiles and military vehicles from NATO allies. “We will continue to insist on full oil and gas embargo,” he told reporters at NATO, speaking alongside Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg.- Reuters Russian and Belarusian runners will not be allowed to take part in this year’s Boston Marathon because of the invasion of Ukraine, organisers said on Wednesday. Russian and Belarusian athletes living in their respective countries are barred from the April 18 race, the Boston Athletic Association said. However, Russian and Belarusian citizens not residing in either country would be allowed to take part, but not under the flag of either nation. “Like so many around the world we are horrified and outraged by what we have seen and learned from the reporting in Ukraine,” Boston Athletic Association chief executive Tom Grilk said.- AFP The Senate will take up legislation Thursday to end normal trade relations with Russia and to ban the importation of its oil, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Wednesday. Both bills have been bogged down in the Senate, frustrating lawmakers who want to ratchet up the U.S. response as the Ukraine war enters a gruesome new phase. It’s been three weeks since the House passed the trade suspension measure that paves the way for President Joe Biden to enact higher tariffs on certain Russian imports. At the time, the legislation was billed as sending a message to Russian President Vladimir Putin and his allies about the economic isolation Russia will face for invading Ukraine.- AP The mayor of the besieged port city of Mariupol put the number of civilians killed there at more than 5,000 Wednesday, as Ukraine collected evidence of Russian atrocities on the ruined outskirts of Kyiv and braced for what could become a climactic battle for control of the country’s industrial east. Ukrainian authorities continued gathering up the dead in shattered towns outside the capital amid telltale signs Moscow’s troops killed civilians indiscriminately before retreating over the past several days. In his nightly address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that the Russian military continues to build up its forces in preparation for the new offensive in the east, where the Kremlin has said its goal is to “liberate” the Donbas, Ukraine’s mostly Russian-speaking industrial heartland. He said Ukraine, too, was preparing for battle. “We will fight and we will not retreat,” he said.- AP  Little is known publicly about Russian President Vladimir Putin’s daughters, sanctioned on Wednesday by the US government over Moscow’s “atrocities in Ukraine.” The US Treasury identified the daughters as Katerina Tikhonova, “a tech executive whose work supports ... the Russian defense industry” and Maria Vorontsova, who leads state-funded genetics research programs “personally overseen by Putin.” A senior US official said Washington believes “Putin’s assets are hidden with family members.”- AFP India’s vote at the UN General Assembly will be watched closely, as a resolution sponsored by the U.S., U.K. and other countries seeks to suspend Russia’s membership of the UN Human Rights Council (HRC), where it is an elected member, after the discovery of mass graves and human rights excesses in the Ukrainian city of Bucha.

533,"April 07, 2022",00:24 IST,news,international,UNGA to vote on suspending Russia from Human Rights Council over Bucha killings,"  India’s vote at the UN General Assembly will be watched closely, as a resolution sponsored by the U.S., U.K. and other countries seeks to suspend Russia’s membership of the UN Human Rights Council (HRC), where it is an elected member, after the discovery of mass graves and human rights excesses in the Ukrainian city of Bucha. Thus far, India has abstained on at least 10 resolutions critical of Russia at the UN Security Council, UN General Assembly, Human Rights Council and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).  On Thursday, the UNGA is expected to vote on the resolution calling for the suspension of Russia from the Human Rights Council, after which members will make their statements on the situation in Ukraine. The vote will follow after a series of foreign officials and ministers from countries that are part of the U.S.-EU led sanctions regime visited Delhi in the past two weeks, calling on India to change its position on Ukraine. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov had also visited Delhi last week, praising India for its “independent” position. When asked about India’s vote on the UNGA resolution, officials said that while India had called for an “independent enquiry” into the killings in Bucha, an investigation team had yet to be constituted and it might be more difficult to vote until there was a definitive conclusion about who was responsible for the excesses. According to an official, the vote is not just about Russia and Ukraine, but the principle of whether such a procedure should be used to suspend an elected member at the UN body. In what was seen as a toughening of its stance, India on Tuesday condemned the killings of civilians in Bucha and called for an independent enquiry into them, although its statement at the UNSC didn’t directly refer to Russia. As a result, the vote, the first such resolution since Libya was suspended by a unanimous UNGA decision in 2011, will be watched keenly for whether India would change its stand from the previous abstentions. If India abstains in this case, the vote would work in favour of the U.S.-led resolution which needs a two-thirds majority of the “present and voting” members in the UNGA on Thursday.",Suhasini Haidar,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/unga-to-vote-on-suspending-russia-from-human-rights-council-over-bucha-killings/article65297325.ece
534,"April 06, 2022",22:52 IST,news,international,Burkina ex-president Compaore gets life for revolutionary leader Thomas Sankara killing," A military court in Burkina Faso on Wednesday handed down a life term to former president Blaise Compaore over the 1987 assassination of revolutionary leader Thomas Sankara. Life terms were also handed to Hyacinthe Kafando, an officer suspected of having led the hit squad, and General Gilbert Diendere, an army commander at the time of the assassination, which coincided with a coup that brought Compaore to power. Compaore, who lives in exile in Ivory Coast after being toppled by public protests in 2014, and Kafando, who has been on the run since 2016, were tried in absentia. The six-month trial, which was punctuated by a coup d'etat in January, brings the curtain down on a 34-year saga. The case has been avidly followed by many in the landlocked Sahel state, for whom Sankara's assassination remains a dark blot on the country's history. A fiery Marxist-Leninist who blasted the West for neo-colonialism and hypocrisy, Sankara was gunned down on October 15 1987, little more than four years after coming to power as an army captain aged just 33. He and 12 colleagues were shot dead by a hit squad at a meeting of the ruling National Revolutionary Council. The death of the left-wing icon remained shrouded in mystery throughout the Compaore's 27-year reign. The court in the capital Ouagadougou found Compaore, Kafando and Diendere all guilty of harming state security. Compaore and Diendere were also found guilty of complicity in murder, and Kafando of murder. Their sentences exceeded the request of military prosecutors, who had sought a 30-year term against Compaore and Kafando and a 20-year term against Diendere. Applause broke out in the courtroom when the verdict was pronounced, an AFP journalist reported. Eight other accused were given jail terms ranging from three to 20 years, while three defendants were acquitted.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/burkina-ex-president-compaore-gets-life-for-revolutionary-leader-thomas-sankara-killing/article65297088.ece

536,"April 06, 2022",22:36 IST,news,international,Beijing set to appoint former police officer as Hong Kong’s next leader," A former police officer and top security official is likely to become the next leader of the financial hub of Hong Kong, underlining Beijing’s continued emphasis on security in the Special Administrative Region despite mounting economic challenges. The SAR’s current number two official, Chief Secretary John Lee, on Wednesday tendered his resignation as he prepares for next month’s election for the top post of Chief Executive (CE).  Current leader Carrie Lam said on Monday she would not seek a second term, following a tumultuous five years at the helm marked by pro-democracy protests in 2019, a sweeping national security law in 2020 that dealt a crippling blow to political freedoms in Hong Kong, and in the past few months, a devastating wave of COVID-19 infections that overwhelmed hospitals. Beijing’s emphasis on security in the SAR, observers said, was reflected in its backing of Mr. Lee as the next leader. The central government, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported, told pro-Beijing lawmakers it would not back any other candidate for the May 8 election. The top leader is not voted for by the people of Hong Kong but chosen by a 1,500 member election committee comprised of largely pro-Beijing and industry representatives. Candidates have to first be vetted, under new electoral laws passed last year that tightened Beijing’s control over the process. Mr. Lee, 64, has served as Chief Secretary under Ms. Lam since June 2021.  With a long career in law enforcement, he joined the Hong Kong Police Force in 1977 as a Probationary Inspector, according to his official biography. He rose through the ranks and held top positions in the police force, rising to Secretary of Security in 2017.   In that position, he led the response to the sweeping protests of 2019 that had called for universal suffrage and direct elections to choose the CE. Mr. Lee was strongly critical of the protests, which led to violent clashes with the police and subsequently the passing of sweeping national security legislation by Beijing the following year.  Ms. Lam cited family reasons for her decision to not seek a second term, although many in the SAR saw her prospects of continuing as slim after the disastrous handling of the pandemic this year. With two years of isolation from the world, Hong Kong in 2020 and 2021 followed a largely successful “zero COVID” strategy seeing only around 12,000 cases and 220 deaths, the lowest for any major city. That strategy fell apart with the Omicron variant leading to a sweeping wave starting in December. Since then, more than 1 million people in a region of 7 million have been infected and more than 8,000 have died, most unvaccinated elderly residents.  Cases that crossed 1 lakh a day have since declined to under 3,000. Businesses in the Asian financial hub, however, are still counting the costs of both COVID-19 and the continuing isolation from the world two years into the pandemic, with the SAR still limiting flights and enforcing mandatory quarantine for arrivals despite the recent wave of cases. Hong Kong’s economy contracted by 6.5% in 2020 and recovered to grow 6.4% this year. The SAR also faces longer term challenges with the financial centre seeing a recent exodus of professionals because of concerns over both the national security law’s restrictions as well as the continuing travel restrictions. A number of media organisations have shut down in the past year because of the law, while last week, two U.K. judges serving on the Court of Final Appeal resigned citing the law and the erosion of the judicial independence that made Hong Kong a unique enclave within China under the “one country, two systems” model.",Ananth Krishnan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/beijing-set-to-appoint-former-police-officer-as-hong-kongs-next-leader/article65296914.ece

Jaishankar said on Wednesday. Speaking in the Lok Sabha during a discussion under Rule 193 regarding the crisis in Ukraine and its implications, Dr. Jaishankar said that Russia is “a very important partner” but also held that India is against the conflict. He acknowledged the support provided by Russia, Ukraine and even Indian nationals based in Eastern Europe during Operation Ganga to evacuate Indian students from Ukraine.   “In terms of diplomacy, India continues to press forcefully for an immediate cessation of hostilities and an end to violence. We encourage talks between Ukraine and Russia, including at the level of their Presidents. The Prime Minister has spoken to them both in this regard. This was precisely the message that was conveyed to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov when he was in Delhi. If India can be of any assistance in this matter, we will be glad to contribute,” Dr. Jaishankar said, reiterating India’s commitment to supply humanitarian goods to Ukraine. The EAM stated that the Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine, Yulia Svyrydenko, had requested him over a telephone call for more medical supplies to deal with the crisis. The Minister pointed to the non-military fallout of the crisis, which has affected a wide spectrum of economic activities like the energy and fertilisers sectors, and said the government is trying to ensure food security for common people in the country as well as in countries abroad. As part of the government’s response to the crisis, he assured, India will step forward to meet “global demands for food, grains and other materials”.   “Our effort today is to stabilise economic transactions between India and Russia because this is very important for us. Russia is a very important partner in a variety of areas,” Dr. Jaishankar said, indirectly referring to the crucial role that Russia plays in India’s defence sector. Russia continues to remain the largest arms supplier to India despite strong competition from France, Israel, the United States and other western countries. The specific remarks on economic ties with Russia came after Congress MP Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury sought an explanation on how India would conduct business with Russia as that country was hit by western sanctions.   “At the moment, there is an inter-Ministerial group, which is led by the Finance Ministry, which is seeing how the payments issue can be best addressed. There are experiences from the past which are relevant in this regard,” Dr. Jaishankar said, indicating at the pivotal role the Finance Ministry will pay in ensuring a smooth channel for transactions with Russia.   Editorial | In the middle: On India’s role in Russia-Ukraine crisis Dr. Jaishankar conveyed India’s strong opposition to the ongoing conflict. “We believe no solution can be arrived at by shedding blood and at the cost of innocent lives. In this day and age, dialogue and diplomacy are the right answers to any dispute and this should be borne in mind. If India has chosen a side — it is the side of peace and it is for an immediate end to violence. This is our principled stand and it has consistently guided our position in international forums and debates, including in the United Nations.”  The Minister said that the conflict in Ukraine, which was invaded by Russia on February 24, posed a unique challenge in evacuating Indian students trapped in Kharkiv, Sumy and Kyiv, among other locations. “No other country has carried out a similar operation. Other countries are inspired by our evacuation. I met the Foreign Minister of a country recently who said that they flew out two aircraft from Ukraine with their citizens, and he was surprised that we flew out 90 evacuation flights,” Dr. Jaishankar said. He also said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had to intervene to ensure students could be evacuated safely from Kharkiv, and that he had to dial both Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Ukrainian leadership to create a conducive environment for evacuation.",Kallol Bhattacherjee,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-offers-help-to-end-russia-ukraine-conflict/article65297066.ece
538,"April 06, 2022",21:27 IST,news,international,President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has no reason to resign: Srilankan government chief whip," President Gotabaya Rajapaksa “has no reason” to resign, the chief government whip told Parliament on Wednesday, as citizens’ protests expand, now with state sector workers too demanding his resignation.      “The President has been given a mandate by 6.9 million voters. He does not need to resign,” said Johnston Fernando, who was among the four Ministers that Mr. Gotabaya recently re–appointed to a “new Cabinet”, after members of the old Cabinet resigned en masse.  In his first initiative yet to address the economic crisis after citizens’ protests erupted, President Gotabaya on Wednesday appointed a panel of eminent Sri Lankan economists to advise him on debt restructuring and recovery, a statement said.  The “Presidential Advisory Group on Multilateral Engagement and Debt Sustainability” includes Indrajit Coomaraswamy, former Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Shanta Devarajan, former Chief Economist with the World Bank and Sharmini Coorey, a former Deputy Director at the IMF, the Presidential Media Division said.  The ruling Rajapaksa clan faces unprecedented public criticism as Sri Lanka battles severe shortages of fuel, food and medicines among other essentials, during one of its worst economic downturns.  Mr. Gotabaya’s government lost its majority in Parliament on Tuesday, as over 40 MPs from his party and its coalition partners sat separately, distancing themselves from the unpopular administration.  The widespread public anger, over the government’s ‘mishandling’ of a grave economic crisis gripping the country, first manifested in pocket protests by citizens that began over a month ago. Over the last two weeks, the agitations escalated and the call for the resignation of President Gotabaya, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and their family members grew louder.  Almost every evening now, thousands throng the streets of capital Colombo and many other towns and villages in the island, raising slogans such as “Gota go home”, “Rajapaksas go home”, ”. In addition to citizens, lawyers’ groups, teachers and health workers have also begun protesting in different locations blocking roads or gathering outside the homes of officials, MPs, Ministers, without sparing even the President and the Prime Minister themselves.  As agitations spread, President Gotabaya responded by imposing Emergency, curfew, and banning social media last weekend — moves that his critics see as targeting dissent. Protesters defied the curfew while the ban on social media was removed in less than a day following a backlash. On Tuesday, Mr. Gotabaya also revoked the Emergency, hours after the Opposition challenged him to a parliamentary vote on it.     The political impasse triggered by the Cabinet resignations persists, with the country left with just the President, the PM and three Cabinet Ministers, after one of them resigned within a day. The Opposition has rejected Mr. Gotabaya’s offer to form a national Cabinet and is reluctant to form a caretaker government under his Presidency.  Parliament convened on Wednesday to debate the crisis. Commencing the debate, Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena said: “Sri Lanka is facing the worst economic crisis in history, but it is just the beginning.” As citizens face enormous hardship owing to the stifling shortages, he said experts have warned of a severe food shortage.  “The food, gas and electricity shortages will get worse. There will be very acute food shortages and starvation,” he said, urging parliamentarians to set aside political differences and respond collectively to the crisis.

539,"April 06, 2022",20:32 IST,news,international,U.S. announces more Russia sanctions," Days after gruesome images of murdered civilians in the Bucha suburb of Kyiv surfaced, the White House announced that it would impose further sanctions on Russian entities and individuals, including a ban on American investments in Russia and sanctions on the families of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. The latest round of punitive measures would be applied in concert with the EU and Group of Seven (G7) countries, the Biden administration announced. The measures against Russia would include “full blocking sanctions” on Russia’s largest bank, Sberbank, and its largest private sector bank, Alfa Bank. No ‘U.S. Person’ (i.e., a resident entity or citizen) is permitted to transact with these banks and all their U.S. assets will be frozen.  President Joe Biden will also sign an executive order banning new investments in Russia by U.S. persons and the U.S. Treasury Department is expected to announce a ban on transactions by U.S. persons with a list of major Russian state-owned enterprises on Thursday. There will be a carve-out for energy sector enterprises. Europe is still heavily dependent on Russian energy imports.  Also announced on Wednesday were full blocking sanctions on the adult children of Mr. Putin and Mr. Lavrov’s wife and daughters as well as Russian Security Council members — former President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and former Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin. The White House also announced that carve-outs and exemptions would apply for humanitarian activities.  India is not directly impacted by this new set of sanctions as they are specific to the U.S., the EU and G7. A senior U.S. administration official said that while India is not part of the G7 — and is a guest country this year — the U.S. remained “hopeful” to have as much alignment with India as possible. “India is not part of the G7. It’s a guest country this year. So, we will certainly collaborate with India and share the details of our measures and, of course, we remain hopeful that we can have alignment to the maximum extent possible,” the official said in response to a question from The Hindu on the links between these sanctions and India and also the level of alignment between the U.S. and India on sanctions. U.S. Deputy National Security Adviser for International Economics Daleep Singh was in India last week with some tough words for New Delhi around potential alternative payment mechanisms with Russia that India is considering to facilitate oil purchases from Moscow. The comments were met with indignation. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said India would, keeping its national interests in mind, buy fuel at a discounted price, if there was an opportunity to.  This week, U.S. officials have been questioned on India’s participation in the U.S. sanctions regime and the impact of these sanctions, if India and China continue trade with Russia. Responding to The Hindu on Wednesday’s briefing call, the senior administration official said: “India is our friend, India’s our partner and we share interests and we share core principles that are at stake in this conflict and we’ve had extensive discussions about ways to further our cooperation on global food security, on global energy supplies, and certainly in terms of recognising that Putin’s brutality affects all of us and the geopolitical implications of Russia’s actions do have ripple effects.” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki, on Tuesday, had said the EU and G7 were joining the U.S. and this accounted for “about 50%” of the world economy, creating significant impact, while responding to a question on the effectiveness of this latest round of sanctions, given that some large economies like India, China and Brazil were not participating.  The U.S.’s “expectation” was that other countries would not only abide by the sanctions but also be a “constructive part” in holding Moscow accountable, Ms. Psaki said.

540,"April 06, 2022",20:13 IST,news,international,Pakistan Supreme Court seeks minutes of NSC meeting; adjourns hearing till April 7 on no-trust motion," Pakistan's Supreme Court on Wednesday sought minutes of the National Security Council meeting to know more about the alleged ""foreign conspiracy"" as it adjourned till Thursday the hearing of the crucial case about rejection of the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Imran Khan through a controversial ruling by the deputy speaker of the National Assembly. National Assembly Deputy Speaker Qasim Khan Suri on Sunday ruled that the no-confidence motion was linked with the ""foreign conspiracy"" to topple the government and hence was not maintainable. Minutes later, President Arif Alvi dissolved the National Assembly on advice of Prime Minister Khan. The apex court within hours took suo motu notice of it and a five-member bench started hearing the case on Monday. The bench is headed by Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial and includes Justice Ijazul Ahsan, Justice Mohammad Ali Mazhar, Justice Munib Akhtar and Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail. During the third day of the hearing on Wednesday, Babar Awan appeared for Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party and Ali Zafar represented President Alvi. Chief Justice Bandial asked Mr Awan about the minutes of the recent meeting of the National Security Council which had discussed a letter purportedly showing evidence of the ""foreign conspiracy"" to oust the PTI-led government. During the hearing, Justice Bandial questioned the basis on which the speaker issued the ruling, Dawn newspaper reported. ""Can the speaker announce such a ruling without presenting the facts,"" he asked, adding that this was the constitutional point on which the court had to make a decision. He also asked Mr Awan to inform the court whether the speaker could issue a ruling that was not on the day's agenda by bypassing Article 95. He told the PTI counsel to defend the ruling with ""solid"" evidence. ""Where are the minutes of the NSC meeting?"" he asked Awan. ""We want to see what the conspiracy was that was used to dismiss the motion."" He said that the court would also examine whether the speaker had the authority to deviate from the agenda of the house and rely on some other ""facts"". ""Whether there was such material present…when did the meeting of the NSC take place,"" Justice Bandial went on to ask and said Mr Awan also needed to tell the court if a constitutional process could be sidelined. After Awan, Zafar began his arguments, insisting that any direction from the court on the matter of the deputy speaker's ruling would exceed its jurisdiction. Pakistan Peoples Party lawyer Raza Rabbani and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz counsel Makhdoom Ali Khan have already completed arguments. However, Naeem Bokhari, counsel of deputy speaker Qasim Suri, and Attorney General Khaled Javed Khan, representing the government, are among the lawyers who have not yet presented their views on the case. During the hearing on Wednesday, the chief justice repeatedly reminded the lawyers to conclude their arguments at the earliest to let the bench issue an order. However, since the process was not completed, the court adjourned the case till Thursday while announcing to resume the hearing at 9:30am (local time). A short order may be issued at the conclusion of the arguments. Earlier, the opposition lawyers during the hearing had asked the court to issue at the earliest an order to settle the matter regarding the ruling. The bench assured to come up with a verdict after hearing lawyers representing the government and the opposition. The outcome will not only decide the fate of no-confidence but also the dissolution of the National Assembly and the upcoming elections. If Mr Khan gets a favourable ruling, elections will take place within 90 days. If the court rules against the deputy speaker, Parliament will reconvene and hold the no-confidence vote against Mr Khan, experts said. The prevailing crisis began to unfold after the opposition submitted a no-confidence motion against the Prime Minister on March 8. The voting was scheduled to be held on April 3 but the deputy speaker rejected the motion, saying it was part of a “conspiracy” to topple an elected government.

541,"April 06, 2022",19:21 IST,news,international,All you need to know about Viktor Orban’s election win against the United for Hungary alliance,"  In an election underscored by the Russia-Ukraine crisis, Hungarian President Viktor Orban of the Fidesz Party declared victory on April 3 for the governing coalition led by his party against the six-party Opposition alliance United for Hungary, as the vote count was underway.  Mr. Orban, seen as an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, secured his fourth term in a row as Prime Minister of Hungary in the closest-ever competition with an Opposition, as compared to the last three elections in which most predictions had sealed a comfortable win for the right-wing Fidesz.  Preliminary results with 98% of the national party list votes counted, indicated 53.1% votes in favour of Mr. Orban’s Fidesz, with 35% of the votes going to the United for Hungary Opposition-alliance, led by Peter Marki-Zay, a conservative politician with no party affiliation, who served as the Mayor of Hodmezovasarhely, a town in the south of Hungary. “We won a victory so big that you can see it from the moon, and you can certainly see it from Brussels,” Mr. Orban hailed his victory while addressing Fidesz Party leaders on election night in Budapest, referencing the Brussels-headquartered European Union, with which he has frequently been at loggerheads.  At the beginning of this year, the focus of Hungarian political opponents was on issues like the economy, divisive socio-cultural matters like religion, the country’s relationship with the EU, and what the Opposition described as Mr. Orban’s withdrawal from the rule of law in Hungary.  With Russia’s incursion on Hungary’s eastern neighbour Ukraine, however, the dynamics of the electoral discourse shifted for both Fidesz and the six-party Opposition.  Mr. Orban portrayed the election as a choice between war and peace. In an election rally on Friday, he said: “This isn’t our war, we have to stay out of it.”  He has not openly condemned Russia and only supported the EU’s decision to send arms to Ukraine with the condition that Hungary will not be sending a single weapon to aid Ukraine. He has also called for continuing normal ties with Moscow, along with the oil and gas imports.  Meanwhile, the opposition alliance led by Mr. Marki-Zay has called for helping the country’s conflict-torn neighbour, supporting the line taken by the EU and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). He had also laid emphasis on disclosing his opponent’s close ties with Mr. Putin over the past decade.  Owing to the worries of the Opposition and the election watchdog in Europe — the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE —, about the integrity and fairness of the national elections, current polls were held amid external observation.  A civic initiative recruited more than 20,000 ballot counters, two of whom would be present as volunteer vote counters at each of Hungary’s 10,000 polling stations.  The OSCE, for the second time in history, sent a full-fledged election observation mission to an EU-member country, including 18 long-term observers and 200 temporary observers present on election day.  In mid-March, an OSCE interim report pointed to recent changes in the country’s electoral law, saying they were made without a proper consultative process. The changes allow voters to cast their votes in a district where they don’t reside but have a registered address, which the Opposition said would open the doors for “voter tourism”.  The current Hungarian election coincided with Mr. Orban holding a nationwide referendum on a controversial law targeting LGBTQ communities. This was preceded by legal action from the European Commission over the legislation. Less than half of the country’s valid voters cast their vote in this referendum. The national election was also being seen with the economic recovery lens post the pandemic. In 2020, a COVID-time emergency law was enacted by the Fidesz government, expanding the powers of the Prime Minister and penalising any form of fake news. His government also faces the threat of the European Union — under a mechanism approved in 2020 the EU could cut Hungary’s pandemic recovery funding if it does not adhere to the rule of law and core EU values.  Notably, Mr. Orban had joined Fidesz (the Federation of Young Democrats) as a young anti-Communist with a view to integrate Hungary with Europe. In the national elections of 1998, he moved the party to the centre-right ideology. He won his first term as the Prime Minister that year and pushed for Hungary’s entry into NATO. His party lost power to the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSzP) in 2002 and did not come back to power till 2010, after which Mr. Orban has not been dislodged from his position.  Enjoying a parliamentary majority, Fidesz under Mr. Orban started changing Hungary’s constitutional and judicial structure. The constitution was made more conservative, tilting towards Christian ideals, while the independence of the legal system was curtailed, according to the Council of Europe. These moves invited widespread protests at home and flak from the international community.  In the next national vote in early 2014, despite corruption allegations by Opposition parties in the Parliament, Fidesz and its coalition partner, the Christian Democratic People’s Party, secured an overwhelming win. By that time, a law targeting the advertising revenues of media and one that allowed surprise inspections of Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) had been passed.  Post elections, Mr. Orban announced that his administration would be a self-styled new form of democracy, called “illiberal” democracy. His government’s relations with the EU started getting strained over Hungary’s refusal to take in asylum seekers during the European refugee crisis in 2015, taking the stance that it was not Hungary’s problem. Hungary constructed a barbed-wire fence along its border to prevent refugees from conflict-hit states of the Middle East and Africa from getting safe passage to Europe.  Continuing its anti-immigrant and nationalist rhetoric, the Fidesz coalition won a third term in 2018.  All of Hungary’s new policies and the stand on refugees led to Fidesz’s biggest face-off in the European Parliament of the EU, where member parties voted on whether to take action against Mr. Orban for undermining democracy and violating the “common values of the EU”. Even though the majority vote was against Mr. Orban, sanctions did not follow as they would require another majority vote in the European Council.  With Fidesz having a majority in the Parliament since 2010, the Opposition in Hungary realised that a single opposition party could not dislodge the nationalist Prime Minister. Signs of all opposition parties reluctantly joining hands to fight the national election against Mr. Orban had emerged in the 2018 election as well, but the proposed alliance did not come through.  This time around, six opposition parties and some activist organisations from the liberal to right-wing, formed a poll alliance. This included the Democratic Coalition, The Jobbik Party, Hungarian Socialist Party, two Greens parties, and the fairly new Momentum Movement (MM). A liberal-conservative movement led by the face of the Opposition, Mr. Marki-Zay, and a progressive movement led by the former Mayor of Budapest, Gergely Karácsony, are also a part of the alliance.  Late last year, when the opposition parties held high-profile primaries where Hungarians voted to select the face of the alliance and its Prime Ministerial candidate, Mr. Marki-Zay, a Christian conservative and a father of seven, emerged victorious.  Mr. Marki-Zay, whose only political experience was his Mayoral stint that started in 2018, had built a strong network of activists across Hungary, called the Movement for a Hungary of Everyone.  Riding on the success in the primary, and criticising Fidesz’s policies on the judiciary, media and severed ties with the EU, the Opposition alliance was running neck-to-neck with it at the start of this year. Mr. Marki-Zay, emphasising Mr. Orban’s ties with Russia posed the election as a choice between Moscow and the West.  However, inter-party differences between older and progressive parties and the change in the election dynamic due to the Ukraine crisis led to Mr. Orban retaining a majority for his party in the National Assembly.

542,"April 06, 2022",18:51 IST,news,international,Explained | What is Article 5 of the Pakistan Constitution?," The story so far: Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Sunday that he has advised President Arif Alvi to dissolve the National Assembly and call for fresh elections in the country. The move came shortly after a no-confidence motion against Mr. Khan was rejected by the Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly, Qasim Suri.  Mr. Suri had dismissed the no-confidence motion moved by the Opposition, saying it is against the Constitution of Pakistan. “The no-confidence should be according to the Constitution of and rules of the country. Since it is not as pointed out by the Law Minister, I reject the no-confidence motion,"" Suri said.  Speaking in the Assembly, Law Minister Fawad Chaudhry had said that it has been established through a “letter” that the no-confidence motion was influenced by foreign powers and is therefore against Article 5 of Pakistan’s Constitution.  Suri chaired the session after Opposition parties filed a no-confidence motion against Speaker Asad Qaiser.  Article 5 of the Pakistan Constitution discusses loyalty to the State and obedience to Constitution and law. It says:  1. Loyalty to the State is the basic duty of every citizen.  2. Obedience to the Constitution and law is the inviolable obligation of every citizen wherever he may be and of every other person for the time being within Pakistan.  Mr. Chaudhry alleged that the Opposition’s no-confidence motion against Mr. Khan’s government is an attempt by foreign powers to topple the government in the country. The Law Minister said that the motion violates the clause of loyalty to the State and is, hence, illegal.  Addressing the National Assembly, Mr. Chaudhry said, “It is an effective operation for a regime change by a foreign power. It is not an issue of no-confidence but of Article 5.” His argument was accepted by Mr. Suri. As a result, the no-confidence motion was rejected and the session was adjourned.  Prime Minister Khan addressed the nation and congratulated the citizens of Pakistan on the dismissal of the no-confidence motion.  Pakistan Supreme Court had taken suo moto cognisance of the matter on Sunday, asking all political parties to maintain law and order. On Monday, the court adjourned the hearing in the matter by a day. During the proceedings, Opposition’s demand for a full bench was rejected by the Chief Justice. The court will now resume proceedings in the case on Tuesday, 12.00 p.m.  Meanwhile, former Chief Justice Gulzar Ahmed was nominated to be the caretaker Prime Minister by Mr. Khan. President Alvi had sought suggestions from Prime Minister Khan and Leader of the Opposition Shehbaz Sharif for the appointment of a caretaker prime minister. In his letter, Mr. Alvi had said that in case Mr. Khan and Mr. Sharif do not agree on the appointment within three days of the dissolution of the Parliament, they shall forward two nominees each to a committee to be constituted by the Speaker, comprising eight members of the outgoing assembly, or the Senate, or both, having equal representation from the treasury and the opposition. The President of Pakistan is legally required to consult the leader of the Opposition before appointing the caretaker prime minister, but Mr. Sharif refused to participate in the proceedings, calling them illegal.

543,"April 06, 2022",18:06 IST,news,international,Iran says it gave long-sought answers to United Nations atomic watchdog,"  Iran, on April 6, said it supplied the United Nations' nuclear watchdog with documents explaining the discovery of suspect enriched uranium traces, state media reported, the first acknowledgement from Tehran that it had answered the agency's long-standing demands.  The head of Iran's civilian Atomic Energy Organisation, Mohammad Eslami, said that on March 20, Iran had sent the requested explanations about several former undeclared sites in Iran where there was evidence of past nuclear activity. The deadline came as part of an agreement announced last month to resolve the problem of undeclared uranium particles in Iran by June — long a source of tension between Tehran and the UN atomic watchdog.  The thorny issue is separate from now-stalled talks to revive Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers, which collapsed four years ago when former President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the accord and imposed crushing sanctions on Iran. In the meantime, Iran has vastly expanded its nuclear work.  As the fate of a renewed nuclear deal hangs in the balance, long-sought answers about Iran's old but undeclared nuclear sites would improve trust and solve a major sticking point in its negotiations with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The IAEA did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Mr. Eslami's statement.  Mr. Eslami told reporters that Iran had handed over documents to the UN watchdog about the three requested sites in Iran, without elaborating. He expected agency inspectors to visit Iran “to review the answers"" and finish a report on the subject by late June, he added.  The IAEA in 2019 first discovered the traces of man-made uranium that suggested they were once connected to Iran's nuclear programme. The U.S. intelligence agencies, Western nations and the IAEA have said Iran ran an organised nuclear weapons programme until 2003. Iran long has denied ever seeking nuclear weapons.  As a member of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, Iran is obligated to explain the radioactive traces and to provide assurances that they are not being used as part of a nuclear weapons programme. The IAEA has staked its credibility on finding information about the sites, with its head Rafael Grossi routinely lambasting Iran for its failure to answer where the radioactive particles came from and where they are now.  Eslami on Wednesday claimed that one of the particles discovered by IAEA inspectors does not exist in Iran, without offering evidence or details. He blamed regional archenemy Israel for “sowing doubts” about the nature of Iran's nuclear programme. Israel has said it believes Iran would pursue a nuclear weapon, despite Western intelligence assessments indicating otherwise.  Tehran currently enriches uranium up to 60% purity — its highest level ever and a short technical step from weapons-grade levels of 90% and far greater than the nuclear deal's 3.67% cap. Its stockpile of enriched uranium continues to grow as nuclear talks in Vienna flounder, worrying nuclear nonproliferation experts that Iran could be closer to the threshold of having enough material for an atomic weapon if it chose to pursue one.

544,"April 06, 2022",17:29 IST,news,international,Bucha killings | Pope slams 'horrendous cruelty' in Ukraine," Pope Francis on April 6 hit out at the ""ever more horrendous cruelty"" in Ukraine, after the murder of civilians in the town of Bucha near the capital. ""The recent news about the war in Ukraine, instead of bringing relief and hope, instead attests to new atrocities, such as the Bucha massacre,"" the Pope said during his weekly general audience at the Vatican. ""Ever more horrendous cruelties, also perpetrated against defenceless civilians, women and children. These are victims whose innocent blood cries out to heaven and begs for mercy,"" he said. Pope, 85, then stood and held up a flag he said ""comes from the war. From that martyred city Bucha"". He then folded the flag and kissed it. The discovery of dozens of bodies in mass graves or littering the streets in Bucha over the weekend has sparked global outrage. Pope also deplored the ""powerlessness of international organisations"" in the face of the Russian aggression. ""After the Second World War, attempts were made to lay the foundations for a new history of peace, but unfortunately the old history of competing great powers continued,"" he said. ""And in the current war in Ukraine, we are witnessing the powerlessness of international organisations"". The Ukrainian army retook control of the key commuter town outside Kyiv just a few days ago and said it had found the bodies, some with their hands bound behind them, after Russian forces pulled out. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has called the killings ""war crimes"" and ""genocide"" and Western countries have ramped up sanctions against Russia in reaction to the deaths. But the Kremlin has denied the accusations and claimed the images emerging from Bucha and other towns are fakes produced by Ukrainian forces, or that the deaths occurred after Russian soldiers pulled out.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/bucha-killings-pope-slams-horrendous-cruelty-in-ukraine/article65296091.ece
545,"April 06, 2022",16:48 IST,news,international,Hong Kong deputy chief says he plans to run for city's top job," Hong Kong Chief Secretary John Lee, a security official during the global financial hub's prolonged and often violent 2019 pro-democracy protests, said on April 6 he had resigned in a bid to run in an election in May to become the city's new leader. Mr. Lee, 64, a former deputy commissioner of police, was promoted to the global financial hub's No. 2 role in 2021 in a move that some political analysts said signalled Beijing's priorities for Hong Kong were security rather than the economy. ""I indicate in the letter the reason for my resignation is that if my resignation is approved by the Central People's Government, I shall plan to prepare to stand for the upcoming chief executive election,"" Mr. Lee said at a news conference. He is the first government official to announce a bid for the Chinese-ruled city's top job, with media reporting that he will be the only candidate in the chief executive election, due to take place on May 8. Mr. Lee was among other senior Hong Kong and Chinese officials sanctioned by the United States in 2020 for what Washington described as their role in curbing Hong Kong's freedoms under a sweeping national security law imposed on the city by Beijing. Hong Kong and Chinese authorities deny individual rights are being eroded and say the security legislation was needed to restore stability after prolonged unrest in 2019. Previous chief executives had extensive economic and social policy-making expertise and Mr. Lee was the first security official to lead the city in his role as chief secretary. Mr. Lee's promotion to the city's No. 2 position saw police chief Chris Tang take the security secretary post previously occupied by Mr. Lee. Last year, as Hong Kong's security chief, Mr. Lee sent letters to media tycoon Jimmy Lai and branches of HSBC and Citibank threatening up to seven years' jail for any dealings with the billionaire's accounts in the city, according to documents seen by Reuters. His bid for the city's top political post is a sign of the growing power security officials are gaining in the former British colony after faithfully implementing Beijing's new laws. If successful, Mr. Lee would be the first person with a security background to lead Hong Kong since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. Mr. Lee's announcement comes two days after incumbent Chief Executive Carrie Lam said she would not seek a second five-year term, saying ""it's time for me to go home"", after presiding over one of the most tumultuous periods in Hong Kong's history. Previous chief secretaries had extensive economic and social policy-making expertise and Mr. Lee is the first security official to lead the city in his role as chief secretary. Mr. Lee's promotion to the city's No. 2 position saw police chief Chris Tang take the security secretary post previously occupied by Mr. Lee. Last year, Mr. Lee led the vetting of candidates for the first ""patriots-only"" election for a new-look Legislative Council, where only those loyal to Beijing were allowed to run. Mr. Lee holds a degree from Charles Sturt University in Australia, and joined the Hong Kong Police in 1977. He played a key role in trying to implement a contentious proposed extradition law in 2019 that divided Hong Kong society and triggered the mass protests. That legislation was eventually scrapped amid widespread public calls for Lee to quit. Some observers of Hong Kong politics describe him as resolute, earnest and efficient, but lacking a natural feel for politics. Known for his hawkish stance, Mr. Lee had spearheaded the city's disciplinary forces, including the police, in the national security crackdown, which saw mass arrests of democratic activists, politicians, students and journalists. In one high-profile action this year, Mr. Lee sent a letter to the Wall Street Journal, demanding the newspaper support, rather than criticise a raid by 200 police on a liberal media outlet, Stand News, that led to the arrest of senior editors and the online news portal's closure.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/hong-kong-deputy-chief-says-he-plans-to-run-for-citys-top-job/article65295956.ece
546,"April 06, 2022",16:28 IST,news,international,Explained | Musk earns a seat on Twitter’s board; what next?," Elon Musk is Twitter’s most famous ‘blue tick’ personality with over 80 million followers on the platform. The CEO of Tesla is a regular user of the micro-blogging site, and its most vocal critique. On Monday, Musk had taken 9.2% stake in social media platform, according to a U.S. securities exchange filing. He reported owning 73.5 million shares of the company as of March 14, an announcement that sent the company’s shares soaring 27% in New York Stock Exchange. Musk’s stake is valued at $2.9 billion based on Friday’s closing price, and makes him Twitter’s largest shareholder, holding more than the company’s co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey. That size has earned him a seat at the social media firm’s board.  While Musk did not share any details about why he bought shares of Twitter, except posting a tweet on Monday saying: “oh hi lol”, there are some cues to what he might end up doing at the California-based company.  Content moderation In recent times, the billionaire had weighed up the platform’s commitment to free speech. In some of his tweets he had broached the idea of starting his own social media firm, without disclosing specifics. On March 24, Musk tweeted a poll, asking his followers whether the platform “rigorously adheres” to free speech. Over 70% of the two million users who voted clicked ‘no’.  Musk’s poll came two weeks after the Twitter handle of a U.S.-based parody website, Babylon Bee, was taken down ‘for hateful comment’. The website had derisively awarded Rachel Levine, a transgender U.S. government official, the title “Man of the Year”. The site’s award was in response to USA Today naming the government health official “women of the year”.   That piece of satire was posted on Twitter, which led the platform to block the parody account’s handle. Reacting to Twitter’s suspension, Seth Dillon, the CEO of Babylon Bee, explained in a series of tweets that the platform would not restore the account until the tweet on Rachel Levine was deleted. Dillon refused. The site’s handle is now unblocked, but it has been kept from posting new content. After Musk joined Twitter’s board, Dillon replied to the two-week old pool tweet on Tuesday saying, “Musk reached out to us before he polled his followers about Twitter’s commitment to free speech. He wanted to confirm that we had, in fact, been suspended. He even mused on that call that he might need to buy Twitter.”  In a separate episode, several conservatives took to the microblogging site on Monday expressing hope that Musk would overturn Twitter’s decision to de-platform former U.S. President Donald Trump after the infamous January 6 U.S. Capitol attack. Open-source algorithm Later, on the same day, on March 24, Musk once again reached out to his followers on Twitter. This time he polled on whether the platform’s algorithm be made open source or not. The poll was retweeted by co-founder Dorsey with a note, “the choice to which algorithm to use (or not) should be open to everyone.” Over 80% of the million odd users who took the poll voted ‘yes’.  Some experts note that making social media algorithms open source could weed out misinformation and hatred from these platforms. Having an idea of what a platform prioritises over another will help users to be more informed, and keep bad actors from manipulating the system.  But others point out that the codes that run these platforms are part of the corporation’s trade secret. Balancing disclosure and corporate secrecy will be a tough act to follow as most tech firms may not even have a team or department that has a full view of how their algorithm works. It continues to be black box that few have complete access to. A battle with financial regulators While crafting policies around content moderation and open-source algorithm could take much of Musk’s time at Twitter in the long-term, a fight with financial regulators in the U.S. will be an urgent priority. That’s because, according to the filing, Musk’s disclosed 9.2% holding was submitted in a form that is required for investors to use when they pick more than 5% stock, without planning to seek control of the company. But Tesla CEO will have an active role to play at Twitter. Also, Musk’s notice to the exchange was sent several days later.  According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) has previously brought enforcement actions against some people who missed ownership-disclosure deadlines repeatedly. And Musk’s disclosure could hurt him in his ongoing legal battles with the SEC.",John Xavier,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/explained-musk-earns-a-seat-on-twitters-board-what-next/article65296008.ece

548,"April 06, 2022",15:15 IST,news,international,Sri Lankan feminists seek urgent response to economic crisis," Sri Lankan feminists have sought an urgent, comprehensive response to the country’s worsening economic crisis, prescribing specific measures to address the needs of poor and vulnerable communities most affected by the pandemic.  “We are witnessing the unfolding of a humanitarian crisis,” they said in a statement issued on Wednesday and signed by women’s groups and activists across the island.  While the impact of the economic crisis is felt in all corners of the island, it is daily-wage earners, those dependent on micro, small, and medium enterprises, the urban working poor, along with communities already marginalised on the basis of ethnic, religious, caste, gender and sexual identities that are the worst affected by this deepening crisis, the statement said.  Observing that many are facing “homelessness and destitution”, it pointed to rapidly rising costs of essentials that are proving an enormous challenge to those already on subsistence wages.  For over a month now, Sri Lanka is reeling under the impact of a severe economic downturn, leading to crippling shortages of food, fuel and medicines, and soaring costs of essential items.  “Communities affected by repeated tragedies - the long-drawn-out war, tsunami, Easter bombings [2019]and the Covid-19 pandemic- are yet again facing a blow to their efforts to rebuild their lives. This while life consuming quests for truth and justice are ongoing every day,” the feminists noted. The burden of a flailing economy “invariably falls on women”, they said, as economic risks are pushed into the home sphere. “Women face the double burden of earning an income while performing unpaid care work at home,” they pointed out.  Sri Lanka’s current economic crisis, triggered by a dollar crunch that stems from a Balance of Payments problem has put the spotlight on key foreign exchange earning sectors including exports, tourism and worker remittances.  The export sector, predominantly garments, tea and rubber, is dominated by women’s labour. A major chunk of worker remittances from abroad too, come from Sri Lankan women employed as domestic labourers in West Asian countries, often in exploitative working conditions. “It is the wealth gathered by exploiting women’s labour that has been squandered. No one is held accountable for this loss. Instead, yet again, women are forced to bear the brunt of an economic crisis,” the statement said.  Cautioning that remedial measures including an International Monetary Fund programme might force the government to resort to “austerity measures”, they emphasised the urgent need to prevent “national starvation and chaos”. The signatories recommended a series of measures including an island-wide food distribution system, prioritising nutrition and food sovereignty, expansion of cash assistance, a progressive tax regime, and more support for the public health sector, and called for greater consultation of women.

549,"April 06, 2022",15:11 IST,news,international,Sudan pro-democracy groups call for fresh anti-coup protests,"  Sudan's pro-democracy groups called for mass protests on April 6, denouncing an October military coup that plunged the country into political turmoil and aggravated its economic woes. The call for marches was the latest of many to pressure the generals, whose takeover triggered near-daily street protests demanding civilian rule. The army's takeover upended Sudan's transition to democracy after three decades of repression and international isolation under autocratic President Omar al-Bashir. The African nation has been on a fragile path to democracy since a popular uprising forced the military to remove Omar al-Bashir and his Islamist government in April 2019. The protests have been met by a deadly crackdown that has killed more than 90 people, mostly young men, and injured thousands of others, according to a Sudanese medical group. Western governments and world financial institutions suspended their assistance to Sudan in order to pressure the generals to return to civilian-led government. The UN envoy for Sudan warned last month that the east African nation was heading for “an economic and security collapse” unless it addresses the political paralysis following the coup. Wednesday's marches were called for by the Sudanese Professionals' Association and the Forces for the Declaration of Freedom and Change — an alliance of political parties and groups which spearheaded the uprising that culminated in Omar al-Bashir's ouster in 2019. They want an immediate handover of power to a fully civilian government appointed by the pro-democracy groups, as well as the restructuring of security agencies and dissolution of militias. The demands also include the removal of the ruling generals implicated in the coup, and holding them accountable in “swift and fair trails.” The protests come in the third anniversary of the beginning of a sit-in outside the military's headquarters in the capital of Khartoum that accelerated the removal of Omar al-Bashir. They also come on the 37th anniversary of the overthrow of President Jaafar al-Nimeiri in a bloodless coup in 1985 after a popular uprising. At the time, the military quickly handed power to an elected government. The dysfunctional administration however lasted only a few years until al-Bashir — a career army officer — allied with Islamist hard-liners and toppled it in a 1989 coup.

550,"April 06, 2022",14:58 IST,news,international,Explained | What is the BIMSTEC grouping and how is it significant?," The story so far: The fifth summit of the now 25-year-old Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) hosted by Sri Lanka, was held on Wednesday, March 30, in a hybrid fashion. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who attended the summit virtually, called for unity and cooperation in the region as it faces economic and health challenges. He also announced the adoption of the organisation's institutional architecture- the BIMSTEC charter.  Meanwhile, Union Minister for External Affairs, S. Jaishankar was in Colombo for the ministerial meeting of BIMSTEC members on Tuesday, March 29. Citing the current Russia-Ukraine crisis, He emphasised the importance of maintaining international peace and stability. An official of the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said on Wednesday, that under the new changes adopted in the summit, India will now be the “security pillar” of the BIMSTEC.  The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) is a multilateral regional organisation established with the aim of accelerating shared growth and cooperation between littoral and adjacent countries in the Bay of Bengal region.  It has a total of seven member countries- five from South Asia, including Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, and two from Southeast Asia, including Myanmar and Thailand.  It was founded as BIST-EC, in June 1997, with the adoption of the Bangkok Declaration, with Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka and Thailand as members. It became BIMST-EC (Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Thailand Economic Cooperation) with the entry of Myanmar in late 1997, And eventually, it was named in its current form, when Nepal and Bhutan became members in 2004. The Bay of Bengal region, was one of the world’s most integrated regions until the early twentieth century, according to a 2020 research paper by Constantino Xavier and Riya Sinha for the Vivekananda International Foundation. But after the 1940s, when members of the region became independent and pursued separate goals and alliance systems, “the region’s sense of community has almost completely eroded.” So, the aim of setting up the regional grouping was not to create a new region for cooperation but to revive the connectivity and common interests of the members of the Bay of Bengal region. BIMSTEC’s first Secretary General, Sumith Nakandala, echoed this when he had said, “we are not reinventing the wheel” but just “rediscovering the common heritage around the Bay of Bengal.” According to the official website of BIMSTEC, “the regional group constitutes a bridge between South and South East Asia and represents a reinforcement of relations among these countries.”  What makes BIMSTEC different from other regional groupings such as SAARC or ASEAN is that it is a sector-driven organisation. This means the goals or areas of cooperation are divided between members, for instance, out of the multiple sectors like trade, energy, transport, fishery, security, culture, tourism and so on, India was made responsible for areas like transportation, tourism and Counter-Terrorism earleir.  However, the Ministry of External said that during the current summit, members decided on a complete reorganisation of cooperation activities to streamline them into seven pillars, as opposed to the earlier bifurcation of 14 sectors. It further stated that India will be BIMSTEC's pillar for security; this will include areas of counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime (CTTCC) Disaster Management and Energy.  Until the current summit, BIMSTEC did not have a formal document or organisational architecture, which was adopted this time in the form of the BIMSTEC Charter. However, it did have a working mechanism for policy making and operational goals. Policy making would be done through two types of meetings: Summits, which are supposed to be held every two years; and ministerial meetings of Foreign and Commerce Ministers of member countries for deciding on trade and economic affairs, to be held once every year. An operational meeting of senior officials to monitor the activities of the grouping is also supposed to be held twice a year.  Since its inception, BIMSTEC’s policy making meetings have not been held as per plan. Just five summits, including the current one, have been held in 25 years. Meanwhile, 18 ministerial meets have taken place so far; and between 2014 and 2017, the Senior Officials meet was postponed seven times.  BIMSTEC didn’t have an official headquarters or secretariat until 2011 and 2014 respectively when the headquarters were established in Dhaka and its first Secretary General — Sri Lankan diplomat Sumith Nakandala was appointed. BIMSTEC has a coordinating body called the BIMSTEC Working Group, which has a rotating chairman based on which member country chairs the organisation (the current Chair of BIMSTEC is Sri Lanka). Under this, meetings are to be held monthly at the Dhaka secretariat to review the progress of the regional grouping.  The BIMSTEC region hosts 22% of the world population or 1.68 billion people; and the member states have a combined GDP of US$3.697 trillion/per year.  For India, BIMSTEC aligns with its ‘Act East’ policy for greater regional cooperation in southeast Asia. It could also be seen as aligning with India’s larger goal to gain trade and security prominence in the Indian Ocean region and to cater to the concept of the ‘Indo-Pacific’ region, a major focus of Quad countries.  A 2021 research series of the Observer Research Foundation indicates what’s in it for other member countries to be a part of a grouping focused in the Bay of Bengal. It says that for Bangladesh, BIMSTEC might be a platform to strengthen its much-needed economic development, while Sri Lanka sees the goal of becoming a hub for shipment in the Indo-Pacific region. For smaller members Nepal and Bhutan — the two landlocked, mountainous states — the grouping serves as a pass to the sea. Lastly, for Myanmar and Thailand, it could be seen as a way to reduce over-dependence on China and as an opening to a huge consumer market for its commodities.  Another important factor for India in becoming a prominent leader in the Bay and maintaining peace and security, is China making inroads in the Indian Ocean Region over the years. Besides, China today is involved in a widespread drive to build infrastructure in South and Southeast Asian countries, it has projects under its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in all BIMSTEC members except India and Bhutan.  The idea of BIMSTEC also gained prominence after the 2016 Uri attack when India was able to get SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) nations on its side to boycott the organisations’ summit, which was to be held in Islamabad, Pakistan. The progress of SAARC has stalled over the years due to Indo-Pak relations and what experts call Pakistan’s obstructionist approach to the organisation. BIMSTEC emerged as an alternative platform for cooperation. In the 2014 SAARC summit, Prime Minister Modi called for more shared infrastructure and connectivity in South Asia, and said in an indirect reference to Pakistan: “Those who want to come with us, welcome and those who do not, the rest of us will continue.” India had also invited BIMSTEC heads of state for Mr. Modi’s swearing-in ceremony in 2019.  In this context, India also made efforts to enhance the pace of BIMSTEC’s progress in recent years. The BIMSTEC Energy Centre was set up in Bengaluru, along with the BIMSTEC Business Council, a forum for business organisations to promote regional trade. It aims to create free-trade and power grid interconnectivity agreements, and a masterplan for transport connectivity in the Bay of Bengal region (adopted at the current summit).  And lastly, BIMSTEC is important owing to the land and maritime trade potential of the member countries.  The first and major challenge, according to foreign policy researchers is a lack of efficiency and “sluggish” pace of BIMSTEC’s progress. The inconsistency in holding policy making and operational meetings was mentioned earlier. BIMSTEC secretariat also suffers from inadequate financial and manpower assistance for its operational activities. Another criticism is India’s selective interest in BIMSTEC each time SAARC is hamstrung due to Pakistan.  Besides, BIMSTEC members have a lot of ground to cover in terms of transborder trade and connectivity. For Instance, according to a 2020 research paper, “the 1,600 km long India-Myanmar border remains Asia’s least open”. India’s percentage of annual trade with BIMSTEC countries as a percentage of its total foreign trade was in the double digits in the 1950s, but was just 4% as of 2020. Inter-regional trade within BIMSTEC countries also varies significantly; research shows that member countries trade with each other in terms of the proximity, availability of trade routes and the size of the country’s economy. Notably, it was also seen that a lot of the time, BIMSTEC member countries don’t import goods that are manufactured and exported by other members, instead importing from other non-member countries.  While BIMSTEC members have not adopted a Free Trade Agreement yet, they are involved in multiple bilateral and multilateral free trade, preferential trade and economic cooperation agreements with other countries.  As for maritime trade and tourism, the Bay of Bengal has 15,792 square kilometres, coral reefs of around 8,471 sq.km, and is an important source of natural resources for a coastal population of approximately 185 million people. The fishermen population in the Bay alone is estimated to be around 3.7 million, with an annual fish catch of around six million tonnes, constituting 7% of the world’s catch and valued at around U.S.$4 billion, according to presentations made at the recent Bay of Bengal Maritime Dialogue organised by the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue. Despite this, BIMSTEC members are yet to build a shared and lucrative coastal shipment ecosystem and also grapple with frequent detention of fishermen who cross territorial borders.  In recent years, the progress of BIMSTEC has also been underscored by Bangladesh-Myanmar relations over the Rohingya refugee crisis, the India-Nepal border issue, and most recently, the political situation in Myanmar after the military junta took over in February last year. This year’s Summit also drew attention due to the participation of Myanmar’s Foreign Minister as the country under military rule is seen as a leading violator of human rights in the world.",Diksha Munjal,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/explained-what-is-the-bimstec-grouping-and-how-is-it-significant/article65275690.ece
551,"April 06, 2022",12:30 IST,news,international,Israeli government loses majority as Backbencher quits," An Israeli lawmaker quit the government's wafer-thin ruling coalition over a religious dispute on April 6, throwing the fragile alliance into disarray without a majority in Parliament. Backbencher Idit Silman's departure raises the possibility of new Parliamentary elections less than a year after the government took office. While Prime Minister Naftali Bennett’s government remains in power, it is now hamstrung in the 120-seat Parliament and will likely struggle to function. Ms. Silman, from Bennett’s religious-nationalist Yamina party, had opposed the distribution of leavened bread and foodstuffs in public hospitals — in breach of religious tradition during the Passover holiday, public broadcaster Kan reported.  Mr. Bennett's coalition of eight political parties ranging from Islamists to hard-line nationalists and dovish liberals — all united solely in their opposition to former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — now holds 60 seats in the Knesset, Israel's Parliament. The Knesset is currently in recess and it remains unclear if the Opposition will now have enough support to hold a no-confidence vote and send Israelis to the polls for the fifth time in just over three years. Ms. Silman, said she “cannot lend a hand to harming the Jewish character of the state of Israel and the people of Israel,” and would work to form a right-wing government, Kan reported.  Israel has held four elections in two years in a protracted political crisis over Mr. Netanyahu's fitness to rule while on trial for corruption. The deadlocked elections were finally broken in June when Mr. Bennett and his allies ousted Mr. Netanyahu after 12 years in office by cobbling together a coalition of unlikely allies. Mr. Netanyahu, now Opposition leader, congratulated Ms. Silman and “welcomed her back home to the nationalist camp.”",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/israeli-government-loses-majority-as-backbencher-quits/article65295521.ece

""The images of the massacre, which have been published in the press from various regions including Bucha and Irpin near Kyiv, are appalling and sad for humanity,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.  Beside a tweeted message by the Turkish embassy in Ukraine on Monday, it was the first official reaction from Turkey after dozens of bodies were found in mass graves or littering the streets near the Ukrainian capital over the weekend.  The Kremlin has rejected accusations that Russian forces were responsible for killing civilians near Kyiv and suggested images of corpses were ""fakes"". The Ukrainian army retook control of the key commuter town of Bucha outside Kyiv just a few days ago and said it had found dozens of bodies after Russian forces pulled out. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has called the killings ""war crimes"" and ""genocide"" and Western countries have ramped up sanctions against Russia in reaction to the deaths. But the Kremlin has denied the accusations and claimed the images emerging from Bucha and other towns are fakes produced by Ukrainian forces, or that the deaths occurred after Russian soldiers pulled out. ""Targetting innocent civilians is unacceptable,"" the Turkish Foreign Ministry said.  ""It is our main expectation that the matter will be subject to an independent investigation and that those responsible will be identified and held accountable."" Turkey will continue to work to stop ""such shameful scenes in the name of humanity,"" it added.

Minister Pablo Rodriguez said at a news conference, introducing

require digital platforms that have a bargaining imbalance,
measured by metrics like a firm's global revenue, with news
businesses to make fair deals, that would then be assessed by a
regulator. If such deals do not meet a set of criteria detailed in the
act, the platforms would have to go through mandatory bargaining
and final offer arbitration processes overseen by the Canadian
Radio-television and Telecommunications regulator. The law would work similarly to the one in Australia, whichmade it mandatory for Alphabet Inc's Google and MetaPlatforms-owned Facebook to pay media companies forcontent on their platforms in reforms that have been heralded as

Jaishankar on Tuesday spoke to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and discussed the latest developments in Ukraine. India condemned the killing of civilians in Bucha, Ukraine, at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) on Monday, calling for an independent U.N. inquiry. The United States announced Tuesday it will send $100 million in additional anti-armor weapons to Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said French President Emmanuel Macron has agreed to provide technical and expert support for an investigation into crimes committed by Russian troops in Bucha and elsewhere. Mr. Zelenskyy told the UN Security Council on Tuesday that the atrocities committed by Russian troops are no different from terrorists like the Islamic State extremists as he demanded immediate action to bring the Kremlin’s forces to justice for “war crimes”.  The conflict began escalating on February 21, 2022, after Russian President Vladimir Putin recognised separatist regions in eastern Ukraine and deployed troops in a peacekeeping role. Here are the latest updates The White House has announced sanctions on two daughters of Vladimir Putin over Moscow’s war on Ukraine, saying family members were known to hide the Russian president’s wealth.  It also declared “full blocking” sanctions on Russia’s largest public and private financial institutions, Sberbank and Alfa Bank, and said all new US investment in Russia was now prohibited. The United States has also announced that it has indicted Russian oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev for sanctions violations. Attorney General Merrick Garland said the Russian billionaire had been previously identified as a source of financing for Russians promoting separatism in Crimea and as providing support for the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic in eastern Ukraine. “After being sanctioned by the United States, Malofeyev attempted to evade the sanctions by using co-conspirators to surreptitiously acquire and run media outlets across Europe,” Mr. Garland told reporters.  The indictment was the first of a Russian oligarch in the United States since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said.  Mr. Garland also announced the “disruption” of a global botnet controlled by the Russian military intelligence agency, the GRU.
“The Russian government has recently used similar infrastructure to attack Ukrainian targets,” he said. “Fortunately, we were able to disrupt this botnet before it could be used.  “Thanks to our close work with international partners, we were able to detect the infection of thousands of network hardware devices,” the attorney general said. “We were then able to disable the GRU’s control over those devices before the botnet could be weaponised.” — AFP Ukraine on Wednesday told residents of the country’s eastern regions to evacuate “now” or “risk death” due to a feared Russian attack. “The governors of the Kharkiv, Lugansk and Donetsk regions are calling on the population to leave these territories and are doing everything to ensure that the evacuations take place in an organised manner,” deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk wrote on Telegram. - AFP  The 193-member U.N. General Assembly will vote on Thursday on a U.S. push to suspend Russia from the Geneva-based U.N. Human Rights Council, diplomats said. A two-thirds majority of voting General Assembly members in New York can suspend a country for committing gross and systematic violations of human rights. Russia is in its second year of a three-year term on the 47-member Human Rights Council. - Reuters British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Wednesday the alleged massacre of Ukrainian civilians by Russian troops in the town of Bucha “doesn’t look far short of genocide to me”. The UK government has consistently refused to use the word “genocide” with regard to Ukraine and other conflicts, arguing that designating the worst of war crimes is up a competent court. But Mr. Johnson told reporters: “I’m afraid when you look at what’s happening in Bucha, the revelations that we are seeing from what (Vladimir) Putin has done in Ukraine doesn’t look far short of genocide to me. “It is no wonder people are responding in the way that they are,” the prime minister added.  “I have no doubt that the international community, Britain very much in the front rank, will be moving again in lockstep to impose more sanctions and more penalties on Vladimir Putin’s regime.” - AFP Turkey on Wednesday joined the global condemnation of the murder of civilians in the town of Bucha and other cities in Ukraine and called for an independent investigation. “The images of the massacre, which have been published in the press from various regions including Bucha and Irpin near Kyiv, are appalling and sad for humanity,” the foreign ministry said in a statement. -AFP The United States was expected to announce tough new sanctions on Russia Wednesday, including a ban on new investments, a day after Ukraine’s president showed the UN Security Council harrowing images of violence and accused Moscow of widespread atrocities. The sanctions come after an outcry over the discovery of dozens of bodies in civilian clothing in areas from which Russian troops have withdrawn around Ukraine’s capital, including the town of Bucha. -AFP The United States, in coordination with the G7 and European Union, will ban “all” new investments in Russia on Wednesday in its latest round of sanctions, a source said. The joint measures, in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and alleged carrying out of atrocities, “will include a ban on all new investment in Russia, increased sanctions on financial institutions and state-owned enterprises in Russia, and sanctions on Russian government officials and their family members,” the source familiar with the sanctions told AFP Tuesday. -AFP Twitter announced Tuesday it was introducing new measures against Russian government accounts to reduce the impact of official propaganda on the social network. The official accounts will no longer be “recommended” to Twitter users across all categories of the app, including in searches, the platform said in a statement. -AFP Finland announced Tuesday it would increase its military spending by more than two billion euros over the next four years, saying the decision was spurred on by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The decision to increase the defence budget follows unusually short budget negotiations in the Nordic country that shares Europe’s longest land border with Russia. “The war in Europe has fundamentally changed our security environment,” Defence Minister Antti Kaikkonen said in a statement. -AFP The New Zealand government said on Wednesday it was introducing a 35% tariff on all imports from Russia and would extend existing export prohibitions to industrial products closely connected to strategic Russian industries. “The images and reports emerging of atrocities committed against civilians in Bucha and other regions of Ukraine is abhorrent and reprehensible, and New Zealand continues to respond to Putin’s mindless acts of aggression,” Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta said in a statement. -Reuters Intel Corp is suspending all business operations in Russia, effective immediately, the U.S. chipmaker said on Tuesday, adding that it has implemented business continuity measures to minimize disruption to its global operations. “Intel continues to join the global community in condemning Russia’s war against Ukraine and calling for a swift return to peace,” it added. -Reuters EU nations expelled dozens more Russian diplomats Tuesday amid increasing outrage over the Ukraine conflict, in coordinated moves that have seen more than 200 envoys and staff sent home in 48 hours.

558,"April 06, 2022",03:03 IST,news,international,Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa revokes state of Emergency," Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa late Tuesday, April 5, 2022 night revoked the state of Emergency he had declared on April 1 with immediate effect. In a gazette notification no 2274/10 issued late Tuesday night, the President said he has withdrawn the Emergency Rule Ordinance which gave security forces sweeping powers to curb any disturbance in the country. President Rajapaksa has declared a public Emergency on April 1 amid a spate of protests over the worst economic crisis in the country. The Emergency was imposed because of the mass scale protests planned for April 3 against the current economic hardships faced by the people. Later, the government imposed an island-wide curfew. Protests continued despite curfew and the state of emergency with senior ruling party figures having their homes surrounded by angry protesters who urged the government for solutions to the economic crisis. Several people were injured and vehicles were set on fire as the agitation turned violent. Police fired tear gas and water cannons at the protesters after they pulled down a steel barricade placed near the president’s residence. Following the incident, several people were arrested and a curfew was briefly imposed in most parts of Colombo city. A foreign exchange crunch in Sri Lanka has led to a shortage of essential goods such as fuel and cooking gas. Power cuts that last up to 13 hours a day. The revocation of the gazette assumes significance as the ruling coalition appeared to have lost its majority in the 225 member Parliament with over 40 MPs declaring independence from the ruling coalition. The Emergency approval needs to be ratified in the assembly after 2 weeks of it coming into effect.The Opposition demanded in Parliament on Monday to debate the emergency for its approval. The second largest group within the ruling Sri Lanka People’s Party (SLPP) coalition had officially conveyed to Rajapaksa that their 14 members would not back the motion. If those who declared independence did not vote with the government there was a chance that emergency regulations could not be passed in the assembly. Sri Lanka is currently experiencing its worst economic crisis in history. With long lines for fuel, cooking gas, essentials in short supply and long hours of power cuts the public has been suffering for weeks. Rajapaksa has defended his government’s actions, saying the foreign exchange crisis was not his making and the economic downturn was largely pandemic-driven where the island’s tourism revenue and inward remittances waned.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sri-lankan-president-gotabaya-rajapaksa-revokes-state-of-emergency/article65294425.ece
559,"April 05, 2022",14:27 IST,news,international,Gotabaya govt. loses majority in parliament," Sri Lanka's President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on Tuesday lost his parliamentary majority, as a group of lawmakers from the ruling party and its allies sat independently in the House, deserting the government that faces enormous public criticism for “mishandling” the economic crisis. In another inflexion point in the crisis, newly appointed Finance Minister Ali Sabry resigned from the Cabinet barely 24 hours after taking charge.  Over 40 MPs, including from key partner Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), quit the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP or People’s Front)-led alliance, and the government lost its majority in the 225-member legislature. Thier defection signalled the collapse of the government 's popularity that, in 2020, fetched it a formidable two-thirds majority. However, there is no vote of confidence scheduled yet to test the strength of the government or Opposition .  In his address to Parliament on Tuesday, Leader of Opposition Sajith Premadasa blamed the government for the current crisis, and said it was time for the country to abolish Executive Presidency that allows the President sweeping powers to take unilateral decisions. Opposition legislator and Jaffna MP M.A. Sumanthiran too intervened, challenging the government to put its recently imposed Emergency regulations to vote in the House, as is mandated in the Constitution. However, Mr.Gotabaya revoked the Emergency late on Tuesday, ahead of a possible vote on it. The Parliament will convene on Wednesday to debate the country’s economic crisis that has resulted in severe shortage of essentials for citizens and skyrocketing prices. It has also led to a spontaneous eruption of street protests, with citizens demanding that the President step down.  The President’s attempt to appoint a “new” Cabinet after mass resignations appears to have backfired, with the newly appointed Finance Minister Ali Sabry resigning barely 24 hours after his appointment. Top bureaucrat and Secretary to the Treasury and Finance Ministry resigned on Tuesday, resulting in two crucial positions falling vacant at a time of a dire economic crisis.  Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), where Sri Lanka has sought support, on Tuesday said that it is monitoring political and economic developments in Sri Lanka ""very closely"" amid growing public unrest, Reuters reported. ""IMF staff is looking forward to program discussions with the authorities, including during the visit of the newly appointed Finance Minister to Washington later this month,"" IMF Sri Lanka mission chief was quoted as saying. Except, with Mr. Sabry’s resignation, Sri Lanka did not have a Finance Minister as of Tuesday.  On Tuesday, citizens and professionals including health workers, lawyers, continued agitating at different locations, including outside Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa’s private resident, asking the Rajapaksas to resign immediately. As protests swell in different parts of the country, despite the police attempting to disperse crowds with water cannons and tear gas in some areas, the Ministry of Defence urged citizens not to resort to violence. “I further emphasize that the security forces will act to maintain peace and also will not hesitate to enforce law against those involving in violence,"" said General GDH Kamal Gunaratne (Retd), Secretary, Ministry of Defence in a statement.  The UN on Tuesday expressed concern over “excessive and unwarranted police violence” against protesters. Recalling the report of the UN Human Rights Chief, a spokesman said in a statement: ""the drift towards militarisation and the weakening of institutional checks and balances in Sri Lanka have affected the State’s ability to effectively tackle the economic crisis.""",Meera Srinivasan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/gotabaya-loses-majority-in-parliament/article65293869.ece

""Spoke to @SecBlinken ahead of our 2+2 consultations. Discussed bilateral issues and latest developments pertaining to Ukraine,"" Mr. Jaishankar tweeted. The phone conversation between Mr. Jaishankar and Mr. Blinken came days after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov paid a two-day visit to India during which he said Moscow has begun moving toward conducting trade in national currencies with India and other partners to bypass the ""impediments"" of Western sanctions. Last week, U.S. Deputy National Security Adviser for International Economics Daleep Singh also visited India. Talking to reporters, Mr. Singh had cautioned that there will be consequences for countries actively attempting to ""circumvent or backfill"" American sanctions against Moscow and that Washington would not like to see a ""rapid"" acceleration in India's import of energy and other commodities from Russia. U.S. President Joe Biden recently made a veiled dig at India over its position on the crisis in Ukraine. Mr. Biden said the world had launched a united front across Europe and the Pacific on the Russian attack on Ukraine with the ""possible exception of India"". He also described India's response to the Russian invasion as ""somewhat shaky"". The Ukraine crisis is likely to figure in the '2+2' dialogue between India and the U.S., scheduled to be held in Washington on April 11. However, there is no official announcement on the talks yet. Mr. Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh are set to travel to Washington to hold talks with their American counterparts Mr. Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin.

A statement from the ministry said the decision will take effect from April 30.  The Ministry said the decision of temporary closure of the two embassies and a consulate by the government came after careful deliberation and was part of a general restructuring of Sri Lanka’s diplomatic representation overseas.  It comes in context of the current economic crisis and foreign currency constraints faced by Sri Lanka that has led to protests across the country and resignations en-mass from Sri Lanka's cabinet.  According to the statement, following the closure of the two resident missions, the Ambassador of Sri Lanka in Sweden's Stockholm will be concurrently accredited to Norway and the Ambassador of Sri Lanka in Abu Dhabi will be concurrently accredited to Iraq.  The consular jurisdiction of the Consulate General in Sydney will revert to the High Commission of Sri Lanka in Canberra, Australia, the Foreign Ministry said.

The EU vowed to prepare more sanctions against Russia. However, tougher sanctions against Russian oil and gas have remained a contentious subject for countries in the region. While some countries are for it, others such as Germany, the Netherlands, Bulgaria and Hungary are not convinced. The German Finance Minister, Christian Lindner, has on multiple occasions expressed his country’s inability to stop gas supplies from Russia. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte recently said that he was not in favour of cutting off Russian oil and gas supply. These statements stem from the fact that much of the European region depends heavily on Russia for its energy needs. As energy supply from renewable sources forms a small share in these nations, it is difficult for them to quickly switch to alternate sources The chart shows the amount of coal, gas, crude oil, and other petroleum oil imported by select EU countries from Russia as a % of a country’s total imports (2016-2020).

The expulsions come amid international outrage over killings in the town of Bucha, near Kyiv, where dozens of bodies were found over the weekend in mass graves or littering the streets. ""We have expelled 30 Russian diplomats for national security reasons,"" Italian Foreign Minister Luigi di Miao told Italy's Rai television in Berlin, in news confirmed by the Ministry in Rome. He said Russia's ambassador to Italy, Sergey Razov, had been summoned earlier on Tuesday ""to notify him of the Italian government's decision to expel"" the diplomats ""as ' personae non grata'"". Denmark earlier said it was expelling 15 Russian ""intelligence officers"" accused of spying on its territory. The government condemned what it called ""Russia's brutality against Ukrainian civilians in Bucha"". ""Deliberate attacks against civilians are a war crime,"" it said. But Russian authorities have denied the charges of civilian killings in Bucha and other locations near the capital, with its Defence Ministry on Tuesday claiming that they had been staged by Ukraine. Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod said diplomatic ties would remain with Moscow, and ""the Russian ambassador and the rest of the embassy in Copenhagen are therefore not included in the expulsion"". Shortly afterwards, Sweden's Foreign Ministry announced it was expelling three Russian diplomats who conducted ""illegal operations"" there. ""Today the Foreign Ministry has decided to expel three Russian diplomats who are not working in Sweden in concordance with the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations,"" Foreign Minister Ann Linde said. The announcements follow similar moves by EU allies France, which on Monday expelled 35 Russian diplomats, and Germany, where officials said 40 diplomats had been sent home. Also on Monday, Lithuania said it was expelling the Russian ambassador in response to ""Russia's military aggression"" and what it called the ""horrific massacre in Bucha"". According to an AFP count, European Union countries have expelled more than 230 Russian diplomats since Moscow invaded Ukraine on February 24. Russia said on March 29 it was expelling 10 diplomats from Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia in a tit-for-tat move.

National Assembly Deputy Speaker Qasim Khan Suri on Sunday ruled that the no-confidence motion was linked with a foreign conspiracy to topple the government and hence was not maintainable. Minutes later, President Arif Alvi dissolved the National Assembly on advice of Prime Minister Khan. The apex court within hours took suo motu notice of it and a five-member bench started hearing the case. The bench is headed by Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial and includes Justice Ijazul Ahsan, Justice Mohammad Ali Mazhar, Justice Munib Akhtar and Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail. During the hearing on Tuesday, the court ordered the government to present minutes of the proceedings in the National Assembly after the no-confidence motion was presented. Chief Justice Bandial said that the court only wanted to ascertain the constitutionality of the steps taken by the Deputy Speaker for the dismissal of the no-confidence of motion and subsequent dissolution of the National Assembly. ""Our sole focus is on the ruling of the Deputy Speaker…it is our priority to decide on that particular issue,"" Chief Justice Bandial was quoted as saying by the Express Tribune newspaper. The apex court wanted to see if the ruling of the Deputy Speaker could be reviewed by the bench, he said, adding that the court will merely decide on the legitimacy of the Speaker's action. ""We will ask all parties to focus on this point,"" he added. As the hearing resumed, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Senator Raza Rabbani and senior counsel Makhdoom Ali Khan presented their arguments before the court. Mr. Rabbani said that the court had to examine the extent of the ""immunity"" of parliamentary proceedings. ""Whatever has happened can only be termed as civilian martial law,"" he said. He maintained that the Speaker's ruling was ""illegal"", Dawn news reported. ""The no-confidence motion can't be dismissed without voting on it,"" he said, citing Article 95 of the Constitution. Mr. Rabbani also said that a deliberate attempt was made to construct a narrative against the no-trust move while a foreign conspiracy was also touted. PML-N's counsel Makhdoom Ali Khan said that the no-confidence motion was submitted to the NA with the signatures of 152 lawmakers while 161 had voted in favour of tabling it. ""After that, proceedings were adjourned till March 31."" As per the rules, the counsel pointed out, a debate on the no-trust move was supposed to be conducted on March 31. ""But a debate was not held,"" he said, adding that voting was also not conducted on April 3. After their arguments, the bench adjourned the hearing till Wednesday. Opposition lawyers during the hearing asked the court to issue at the earliest an order to settle the matter regarding the ruling. The bench assured to come up with a verdict after hearing lawyers representing the government and the Opposition. If Mr. Khan gets a favourable ruling, elections will take place within 90 days. If the court rules against the Deputy Speaker, the parliament will reconvene and hold the no-confidence vote against Mr. Khan, experts said. Chief Justice Bandial had said on Monday that all orders and actions initiated by the prime minister and the president regarding the dissolution of the National Assembly will be subject to the court's order. President Alvi, the Supreme Court Bar Association and all political parties have been made respondents in the case. Lawyers from the government and Opposition presented their argument regarding the ruling by the Deputy Speaker. Chief Justice Bandial had earlier Monday said the court would issue a ""reasonable order"" on the issue on Monday. The decision of the court would also determine the legality of the presidential order to dissolve the National Assembly. Former judge Shaiq Usmani said that the court would hear all lawyers and it would be a time-taking process. ""I feel there is a lack of strategy and all lawyers of different parties want to argue but there are almost repeating the main arguments,"" he said, adding that the Opposition parties should have appointed one main lawyer to save time. He said since the attorney general, Khaled Javed Khan, has not yet presented his arguments, it may take another couple of days before the hearing would be concluded, followed by an order. The prevailing crisis began to unfold after the Opposition submitted a no-confidence motion against the Prime Minister on March 8. The voting was scheduled to be held on April 3 but the Deputy Speaker rejected the motion. The political drama is being staged in the court as well as outside as both Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) of Imran Khan and Opposition parties have been trying to paint each other as “traitors”. In the highly charged political atmosphere, the Supreme Court provided a ray of hope to end the impasse as all parties have committed to follow its verdict.

568,"April 05, 2022",16:34 IST,news,international,France pushing for energy sanctions against Russia," French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on April 5 that there is a “total determination” from all 27 European Union countries for sanctions against Russia that could target oil and coal over evidence its troops deliberately killed Ukrainian civilians. Europe’s dependence on Russian oil, gas and coal means finding unanimity on energy measures is a tall order, but the reports of the killings outside Kyiv have increased pressure for tougher EU sanctions.  So far, Europe has not been willing to target Russian energy over fears that it would plunge the European economy into recession. In some ways, it would be easier for Europe to go without Russian oil than gas because most supplies come by tanker and could be purchased from other suppliers. But talk of a possible boycott of Russian oil has helped push up global oil prices this week. Asked whether there was a political willingness to impose sanctions on Russian oil and coal — a move suggested this week by French President Emmanuel Macron — Mr. Le Maire said: “We will see what the position of the other member states will be, but I think there is a possibility to have unity on the 27 member states on these new sanctions.” He did not mention natural gas and a consensus on targeting the fuel that is used to generate electricity and heat homes would be even more difficult to secure. The EU gets about 40% of its natural gas from Russia and many EU countries, including Germany — the bloc’s largest economy — are opposed to cutting off gas imports. France holds the presidency of the EU Council, and Mr. Le Maire spoke ahead of a meeting of EU finance Ministers in Luxembourg, where they will discuss possible new measures to punish the Kremlin. While the EU has stayed away from sanctioning Russian energy so far, individual countries have announced efforts to draw down their reliance: Poland said it plans to block imports of coal and oil from Russia, while Lithuania said it's no longer using Russian natural gas. The European Union gets about 25% of its oil from Russia, while the EU imported 53% of hard coal from the country in 2020, which accounted for 30% of the EU’s hard coal consumption. While coal and oil may be up for discussion, Teresa Ribera, Spain’s Minister for Ecological Transition, said on Tuesday that it is “very hard” for the EU to sanction Russian natural gas because some of the bloc’s countries are dependent on it for their energy supply and that the EU’s strength lies in its unity. “It is very difficult to explain to European public opinion and Ukrainian society that we are still importing Russian energy that finances this war,” she said, adding that energy imports create “obvious moral tension.” European importers pay about $850 million per day for Russian oil and natural gas. Russian natural gas mostly comes by fixed pipeline and would be harder to replace suddenly with shipments of expensive and scarce liquefied natural gas. While oil might be easier to cut off than gas, ditching it would not be without consequences. For one, the resulting price increases for other oil could increase the incentive for India and China, who aren’t taking part in Western sanctions, to buy cheaper Russian crude. Russia is also a major supplier of diesel fuel; if that supply were lost, operating diesel-powered trucks and farm equipment could quickly become more expensive, fuelling already high inflation in Europe. Oil prices rose as buyers seeking to avoid Russian oil bid for limited supply from other producers like Saudi Arabia, commodities analysts at German bank Commerzbank said.  International benchmark Brent rose 3% on Monday and traded on Tuesday above $108 per barrel, up another 1%. U.S. crude rose 1.1% to $104.37 on Tuesday. Crude prices had fallen after U. S. President Joe Biden last week announced the release of 180 million barrels of oil over six months from strategic reserves. Higher oil prices mean more expensive gasoline for U. S. drivers. The next package of EU sanctions will be prepared by the EU’s executive arm, the European Commission, which will then present it to EU countries for approval.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/france-pushing-for-energy-sanctions-against-russia/article65292598.ece
569,"April 05, 2022",16:24 IST,news,international,Kuwait government resigns three months after formation," Kuwait's government resigned on Tuesday, three months after it was sworn in, state media reported, amid escalating disputes with parliament. The Gulf emirate's prime minister, Sabah Khaled Al-Sabah, submitted the cabinet's resignation to Crown Prince Sheikh Meshal al-Ahmad al-Jaber Al-Sabah, the official KUNA news agency said. The move comes a day ahead of a parliamentary vote on a letter of non-cooperation, which 10 lawmakers submitted against the premier after he had been accused of committing ""unconstitutional"" practices, including corruption. Oil-rich Kuwait has been shaken by disputes between lawmakers and successive governments dominated by the ruling Al-Sabah family for more than a decade, with parliaments and cabinets dissolved several times. Kuwait is the only Gulf Arab state with a fully elected parliament, which enjoys wide legislative powers and can vote ministers out of office. In February, the country's interior and defence ministers resigned in protest over the manner of parliamentary questioning of other ministers. Parliament had questioned Foreign Minister Sheikh Ahmed Nasser al-Mohammed Al-Sabah — also part of the royal family — over corruption claims and alleged misuse of public funds.

570,"April 05, 2022",15:02 IST,news,international,Germany shuts down Russian darknet marketplace Hydra; seizes bitcoins worth $25 million," German police said Tuesday they have shut down servers of the world’s largest illegal darknet marketplace Hydra, and seized bitcoins worth 23 million euros ($25 million). Suspects are being investigated for “operating criminal trading platforms on the internet on a commercial basis”, the BKA federal police said in a statement. The statement headlined with “illegal darknet marketplace ‘Hydra Market’ shut down.” Investigations of the Russian illegal marketplace started in August 2021 and also involved several US authorities, the BKA said. Founded in 2015, Hydra served Russian-speaking markets, selling narcotics but also stolen credit card data, counterfeit currency and fake identity documents, masking the identities of those involved using the Tor encryption network. The marketplace had around 17 million customer accounts and over 19,000 vendor accounts, according to the BKA. “The Hydra market was probably the illegal marketplace with the highest turnover worldwide” with sales amounting to at least 1.23 billion euros in 2020 alone, it said. The “Bitcoin Bank Mixer” provided by the platform, a service for concealing digital transactions, had made investigations especially difficult, it added. A seizure banner has been published on the marketplace’s website. The secret “darknet” includes websites that can be accessed only with specific software or authorisations, ensuring anonymity for users. Such networks have faced increased pressure from international law enforcement after a boom in usage during the coronavirus pandemic. A German-led police sting also last year took down the notorious darknet marketplace DarkMarket, which had nearly 500,000 users and more than 2,400 vendors worldwide.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/germany-shuts-down-russian-darknet-marketplace-hydra-bitcoins-worth-25-million-seized/article65292500.ece
572,"April 05, 2022",13:39 IST,news,international,Japan's top envoy brings back 20 Ukrainians from Poland," Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi returned from Poland on Tuesday with 20 Ukrainians displaced by Russia's ongoing war on their country as Tokyo seeks to play a greater role in international support for Ukraine. During three days in Poland, Mr. Hayashi visited facilities for Ukrainian refugees in Warsaw and held talks with Polish officials, international humanitarian organisations and civil groups to assess how Japan can provide support. “As I observed the severe situation faced by Ukrainians who were forced to flee their country because of the Russian invasion, I have renewed my resolve that Japan should cooperate with international society and provide the utmost assistance so that they can return to ordinary lives as soon as possible,” Mr. Hayashi told reporters. Japan has an extremely strict refugee policy and has been reluctant to fully accept migrant workers, making its offer to accept Ukrainians unusual. However, the government has carefully called them evacuees and it is still unclear if the Ukrainian situation will change its immigration policy.  Tokyo expects the 20 evacuees will stay in Japan for at least six months, and will provide further support if needed, said Deputy Justice Minister Jun Tsushima, who was travelling with Mr. Hayashi.  Tokyo has previously accepted about 300 other Ukrainians, all relatives of about 2,000 Ukrainian residents in Japan who arrived on their own since the Russian invasion began. Foreign Ministry officials have said most Ukrainian war-displaced have ties to Europe and they hope to return when the situation allows, indicating Japan is not treating them as refugees seeking permanent residency and protection. Mr. Hayashi said he was impressed by the high level of care and support being given to refugees in Poland, including food, medical care, counselling for those with trauma and support for children. “What we observed here will certainly help us plan our support for them in Japan,” he said. “The 20 people previously contacted Japanese embassies in Ukraine or Poland but had difficulty arranging their own transportation to Japan,” Mr. Hayashi said, declining to give further details because of privacy reasons. Mr. Hayashi and the refugees arrived in Tokyo on Tuesday. After COVID-19 tests on board and necessary arrivals procedures, the Ukrainians were expected to head to their destinations — some to towns where their relatives live and others to government facilities.  He met with them on April 4 to assure them of their safety and support in Japan, where several cities, including Tokyo and Osaka, have offered to provide housing, jobs, education for children and other necessities. Japan, which has a territorial dispute with Russia, took milder steps when Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014.  But this time, due to fears of the impact of the Russian invasion on East Asia, where China's military has become increasingly assertive, Tokyo has taken tougher measures in line with the United States and Europe, while providing support for Ukraine.  Mr. Hayashi held talks earlier on Monday with his Polish counterpart, Zbigniew Rau, as well as Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and President Andrzej Duda.  At a joint news conference with Mr. Rau, Mr. Hayashi praised Poland’s support for war-displaced Ukrainians and pledged that Japan will accept as many evacuees as possible as a humanitarian measure and to show its “solidarity” with Poland. “In order to protect the free and open international order, Japan will continue to cooperate with its strategic partner, Poland,” Mr. Hayashi said. As part of those efforts, Japan will continue to impose tough sanctions on Russia, Mr. Hayashi said. Japan has pledged $100 million in emergency humanitarian aid to Poland and its neighbours that are accepting war-displaced Ukrainians, in addition to an earlier pledge of $100 million in humanitarian aid.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/japans-top-envoy-brings-back-20-ukrainians-from-poland/article65292351.ece

574,"April 05, 2022",12:46 IST,news,international,COVID-19 outbreak 'extremely grim' as Shanghai extends lockdown," The COVID-19 outbreak in China’s largest metropolis of Shanghai remains “extremely grim” amid an ongoing lockdown confining around 26 million people to their homes, a city official said on April 5.  Director of Shanghai's working group on epidemic control, Gu Honghui, was quoted by state media as saying that the outbreak in the city was “still running at a high level. The situation is extremely grim,"" Gu said. China has sent more than 10,000 health workers from around the country to aid the city, including 2,000 from the military, and is mass testing residents, some of whom have been locked down for weeks.  Most of eastern Shanghai, which was supposed to reopen last Friday, remained locked down along with the western half of the city. Shanghai recorded another 13,354 cases on Monday — the vast majority of them asymptomatic — bringing the city's total to more than 73,000 since the latest wave of infections began last month. No deaths have been ascribed to the outbreak driven by the omicron BA.2 variant, which is much more infectious but also less lethal than the previous delta strain.  A separate outbreak continues to rage in the northeastern province of Jilin and the capital Beijing also saw an additional nine cases, just one of them asymptomatic. Workers shut down an entire shopping centre in the city where a case had been detected.  While China's vaccination rate hovers around 90%, its domestically produced inactivated virus vaccines are seen as weaker than the mRNA vaccines such as those produced by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna that are used abroad, as well as in the Chinese territories of Hong Kong and Macao. Vaccination rates among the elderly are also much lower than the population at large, with only around half of those over 80 fully vaccinated.  Meanwhile, complaints have arisen in Shanghai over difficulties obtaining food and daily necessities, and shortages of medical workers, volunteers and beds in isolation wards where tens of thousands are being kept for observation.  Shanghai has converted an exhibition hall and other facilities into massive isolation centres where people with mild or no symptoms are housed in a sea of beds separated by temporary partitions. Public outrage has been fuelled by reports and video clips posted on the internet documenting the death of a nurse who was denied admittance to her own hospital under COVID-19 restrictions and infant children separated from their parents. Circulation of footage showing multiple infants kept in cots prompted the city’s Public Health Clinical Centre to issue a statement saying the children were being well looked after and had been in the process of being moved to a new facility when the footage was taken. At a virtual town hall on Monday, the U.S. Consulate in Shanghai warned of possible family separations amid the lockdown, but said it had an “extremely limited ability” to intervene in such cases.  Concern is growing about the potential economic impact on China’s financial capital, also a major shipping and manufacturing centre. Most public transport has been suspended and non-essential businesses closed, although airports and train stations remain open and the city’s port and some major industries such as car plants continue to operate.  International events in the city have been cancelled and three out of five foreign companies with operations in Shanghai say they have cut this year’s sales forecasts, according to a survey conducted last week by the American Chamber of Commerce. One-third of the 120 companies that responded to the survey said they have delayed investments. Despite those concerns and growing public frustration, China says it is sticking to its hardline “zero-tolerance"" approach mandating lockdowns, mass testing and the compulsory isolation of all suspected cases and close contacts.

575,"April 05, 2022",12:15 IST,news,international,"Democratic, GOP Senate bargainers reach $10bn COVID agreement"," Senate bargainers have reached an agreement on a slimmed-down $10 billion package for countering COVID-19 with treatments, vaccines and other steps, the top Democratic- and Republican negotiators said, but ended up dropping all funding to help nations abroad combat the coronavirus pandemic.  The compromise drew quick support on April 4 from President Joe Biden, who initially pushed for a $22.5 billion package. In a setback, he ended up settling for much less despite administration warnings that the government was running out of money to keep pace with the disease's continued — though diminished — spread in the U.S.  “Every dollar we requested is essential and we will continue to work with the Congress to get all of the funding we need,” said White House press secretary Jen Psaki. “But time is of the essence. We urge the Congress to move promptly on this $10 billion package because it can begin to fund the most immediate needs.""  Mr. Biden and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (Democratic Party, New York), his party’s lead bargainer, abandoned Mr. Biden’s request to include $5 billion to help countries — especially poorer ones — where the disease is still running rampant.  The inability of Mr. Biden and top Democrats to protect the additional spending they wanted came after the two parties gridlocked over GOP demands to pay for it by pulling back unspent aid from earlier pandemic measures. It also reflected the diminished political force that battling COVID-19 has this election year, two years into a pandemic that began with bipartisan support for throwing trillions of dollars at it.  Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, the lead GOP bargainer, hailed the accord as one that would address “urgent COVID needs.” He also trumpeted the measure’s savings, which he said meant it “will not cost the American people a single additional dollar.” Still uncertain on Monday was whether objections by some Republicans might prevent the Senate from considering the Bill this week, as Mr. Biden wants, before the Congress begins a two-week spring recess. It was also not yet certain that there would be the minimum 10 GOP votes needed for passage in the 50-50 chamber.  Its fate was also not guaranteed in the House, where House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, (Democratic, California), and many liberals have criticised the ejection of global assistance. But party leaders there signalled they were ready to compromise. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, (Democratic, Maryland), said, “That’s all the Senate can do right now, which I regret deeply, then I think we need to pass that"" as fast as possible. A senior House Democratic aide, speaking on condition of anonymity to describe internal thinking, said it would be best to take what was achievable and fight for more later.  Mr. Schumer said the agreement would provide “the tools we need” to help the country recover from the economic and public health blows that COVID-19 has inflicted. But he said while the $10 billion “is absolutely necessary, it is well short of what is truly needed to keep up safe” over time.  He said members of both the parties want to craft a second spending measure this spring that could include funds to battle COVID-19 and hunger overseas and more assistance for Ukraine as it continues battling the Russian invasion. “The fate of such a measure is uncertain.“ Mr. Romney also suggested an openness to considering future money. “While this agreement does not include funding for the U.S. global vaccination programme, I am willing to explore a fiscally responsible solution to support global efforts in the weeks ahead,” he said. The agreement comes with BA.2, the new omicron variant, expected to spark a fresh increase in the U.S. cases. Around 9,80,000 Americans and more than six million people worldwide have died from COVID-19.  At least half the agreement’s $10 billion would be used to research and produce therapeutics to treat the disease, according to fact sheets from Mr. Schumer and Mr. Romney. The money would also be used to buy vaccines and tests. “At least $750 million would be used to research new COVID-19 variants and to expand vaccine production,” the descriptions said. Administration officials have said the government has run out of money to finance COVID-19 testing and treatments for people without insurance. They've also said funds are running low for boosters, vaccines focussed on specific variants, free monoclonal antibody treatments and care for people with immune system weaknesses.  The deal is also a reduction from a $15 billion version that both parties’ leaders negotiated last month. Ms. Pelosi abandoned that plan after Democratic lawmakers rejected proposed cuts in state pandemic aid to help pay for the package. Democrats from both chambers complained about the eliminated global spending.  Rep. Pramila Jayapal (Democratic, Washington), leader of the House Progressive Caucus, said it is “a big problem"" to erase the international assistance and “not spend money on making sure this virus is contained around the world.""  Sen. Chris Coons (Democratic, Delaware), a leading foreign policy voice, said he would back the Bill but called it a “grave mistake” to not help other countries' efforts. He called it “fiscally foolish” to not send tens of millions of unused U. S. vaccines abroad to the 2.8 billion unvaccinated people worldwide.  “The measure is fully paid for by pulling back unspent funds from previous pandemic relief bills that have been enacted,” bargainers said. Mr. Romney's fact sheet says that includes $2.3 billion from a fund protecting aviation manufacturing jobs; $1.9 billion from money for helping entertainment venues shuttered by the pandemic; another $1.9 billion from a programme that helps states extend credit to small businesses; and $1.6 billion from agriculture assistance programmes.

576,"April 05, 2022",10:30 IST,news,international,The India-Australia trade agreement," The story so far: On April 2, India and Australia signed an Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (ECTA). The landmark bilateral trade pact is the second trade agreement India has signed this year after inking a similar deal with the United Arab Emirates in February. The ECTA is expected to increase trade between the two sides to $45-50 billion over five years, from the current estimate of $27 billion, and create over 10 lakh additional job opportunities. Under this agreement, India will give 85% of Australia’s exports zero-duty access to its domestic market. India is expected to get zero-duty access to Australia for its goods over five years. The negotiations had begun over a decade ago in 2011, but were restarted in September 2021.  The ECTA is guided by a Preamble and is divided into multiple sections that will govern what is hoped to be the most expansive bilateral trade since the two countries established diplomatic ties before India attained independence.  It has a section on goods exports, and lays out clearly “Rules of Origin” that are aimed at creating anti-dumping measures. There are also sections that are aimed at providing remedies and mechanisms for resolving trade disputes. The Commerce Ministry underlined that this is the first trade deal signed by India that has a compulsory review mechanism after 15 years of implementation.  Under this agreement, Australia will get the opportunity to export certain varieties of agricultural produce like potatoes, lentils, and meat products with some caveats. However, bovine meat is not part of the agreement. Australia may also send machineries that are required for food processing under this agreement. In a historic first, India may open up to a wide-range of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks including Australian beer. Australian wines costing over $5 may face lower import duties in the Indian market. A Joint Dialogue for Wine may be created with participation from industry players and government representatives to ensure cooperation and benefits for both countries.  The Indian side said Australia will provide ‘preferential access’ to “all the labour-intensive sectors” of export items from India such as gems and jewellery, textiles, leather, footwear, furniture, food, engineering products, medical devices and automobiles. India will also allow Australia to export raw materials under preferential terms like coal and mineral ores.  The Government of India has said that Australia has “offered wide ranging commitments” in around 135 sub-sectors and Most Favoured Nation in 120 sub-sectors which cover key areas of the Indian services sector like IT, ITES, business services, health, education and audio-visual services. Indian chefs and yoga teachers will get specific entry quotas into Australia, while Indian students in Australia will be able to secure work visas for periods ranging from 18 months to four years on a ‘reciprocal’ basis. As per the rules framed under the pact, students completing a diploma Down Under will be considered for an 18-month work visa; and those completing their undergraduation may get two years and those with a Ph.D. may be considered for a four-year visa.  India and Australia have agreed to enable fast track approval for patented, generic and biosimilar medicines. Therapeutic Goods Regulators of both sides will have a role to play in monitoring and ensuring smooth trade in pharma products between the two sides. Both sides have agreed to audits of imports that require sanitary and phytosanitary inspection as per the law of the land. The importing side will ensure that plants and plant products, animal products and other goods, and their packaging are inspected through recognised methodologies. If either party finds examples of non-compliance, remedial measures will be taken by both sides.  Under Article 13.5, both parties have agreed to hold consultations — and make “every effort” to find a solution — in case of disputes that may emerge in the course of trade in goods or services. They have also recognised that in case they have to resort to international arbitration, they may opt for an organisation (i.e, World Trade Organization) where both are members. They may also use “good offices” and form panels with qualified members drawn from government and business to resolve the disputes.  The dispute resolution may range from 45 days to 15 months.  The rules of origin are based on the principle that they should be “wholly obtained or produced in the territory of one or both of the parties”. This section ensures that waste material will not be exported by either side unless they contribute to the production of any of the items listed in the ECTA.

577,"April 05, 2022",10:10 IST,news,international,Russia-Ukraine crisis live updates | Crimes by Russia no different than those carried out by ISIS: Ukraine President tells UNSC," As Russian invasion of Ukranian territories continues, world leaders are rallying to suspend Russia from its seat on the U.N.’s top human rights body. This comes in light of the Bucha killings. According to Ukraine’s prosecutor-general Iryna Venediktova, the bodies of 410 civilians have been removed from Kyiv-area towns that were recently retaken from Russian forces. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev says the country feels no impact from the expulsion of its diplomats by various European countries, and indicates Russia will respond in kind. His comments came after Germany expelled 40 Russian diplomats Monday and Lithuania expelled the Russian ambassador and said it would recall its envoy in Moscow. France on Monday also announced it will expel “numerous” Russian diplomats.  Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk says more than 1,550 civilians were evacuated on Monday from the besieged port of Mariupol in southeastern Ukraine. The conflict began escalating on February 21, 2022, after Russian President Vladimir Putin recognised separatist regions in eastern Ukraine and deployed troops in a peacekeeping role. Read | The road to Ukraine peace runs through Delhi Here are the latest updates: Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the UN Security Council on Tuesday that the atrocities committed by Russian troops are no different from terrorists like the Islamic State extremists as he demanded immediate action to bring the Kremlin’s forces to justice for “war crimes”.  “Yesterday I returned from our city of Bucha, recently liberated from Russian troops not far from Kiev. There is not a single crime that they would not commit there. The Russian military searched for and purposefully killed anyone who served our country,” Zelenskyy said in his first address to the UN Security Council. Giving a detailed account of the brutalities conducted by the Russian forces, he said “this is no different from other terrorists such as Daesh who occupied some territories. And here it is done by a member of the United Nations Security Council, destroying internal unity, borders and countries.” “We are dealing with a state that is turning the veto in the UN Security Council into the right to die,” he said in his impassioned address to the UNSC. - PTI Ukrainian authorities have found the bodies of five civilians with their hands tied in a village west of Kiev, including those of the mayor, her husband and son. Police showed AFP journalists four bodies, including that of the mayor, half buried in a grave in a pine forest bordering her house in Motyzhyn. A fifth body was found in a little well in the garden. The dead, including two men not part of the mayor’s family, had their hands tied behind their backs. The mayor, Olga Sukhenko aged 50, her husband and their son, were abducted by Russian troops on March 24, police said. Residents said the mayor and her husband had refused to collaborate with the invading Russian forces. On March 11, the mayor of Melitopol in southern Ukraine was abducted by Russian troops but released after a few days. In Bucha, a town located about 30 kilometres north of Motyzhyn, the bodies of dead civilians have been found scattered on the streets and in mass graves sparking allegations of war crimes. - AFP The mayor of Kyiv urged European politicians to cut all commercial ties with Moscow, saying on Tuesday that all payments to Russia were “bloody money” that would fuel what he called a “genocide of Ukrainians”. The United States and Europe are planning new sanctions after dead civilians were found in recaptured satellite towns near Kyiv, including a shallow mass grave in Bucha, but Russian gas exports to Europe continue. Moscow has dismissed the reports of civilian killings in Bucha as “fakes” aimed at discrediting Russia. “Every Euro, every cent that you receive from Russia or that you send to Russia has blood, it is bloody money and the blood of this money is Ukrainian blood, the blood of Ukrainian people,” Vitali Klitschko, dressed in military clothes, told a mayors’ conference in Geneva via video link. - Reuters Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday said Ukraine’s efforts to push back Russian troops from Mariupol were facing difficulties. In a televised interview with local media, Zelensky said the military situation in the southern port city was “very difficult.” He also said Turkey had proposed a plan to help evacuate wounded people and dead bodies from the city, but cautioned that the initiative depended on the will of Russian President Vladimir Putin.- Reuters Russian communications regulator Roskomnadzor said on Tuesday it wanted Wikipedia to remove “material with inaccurate information of public interest” about the situation in Ukraine. The regulator accused Wikipedia of hosting false information on what Russia calls its “special operation” in Ukraine and on the actions of Russia’s military too. According to Russian law, the owner of an Internet resource that does not delete illegal information when asked to do so by Roskomnadzor can be fined up to 4 million roubles ($48,120.30), the regulator said.- Reuters The Red Cross said Tuesday the team that had been detained on its way to help evacuate civilians from the besieged southern Ukrainian port city of Mariupol had been released. The International Committee of the Red Cross, which for days has been trying to get a team to Mariupol to help provide safe passage for thousands of civilians seeking to leave, said on Monday its staff had been stopped in the nearby town of Mangush, currently under Russian control. The team “that was held by police in Mangush on Monday was released last night”, the Geneva-based organisation said in a statement, adding, “This is of great relief to us and to their families.”- AFP Seven humanitarian corridors will be open on Tuesday, including from the besieged port city of Mariupol and the Russian-controlled Berdyansk, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on the messaging app Telegram. According to Vereshchuk’s post, residents of Mariupol and Berdyansk will be able to leave to Zaporizhzhia on their own transport. Corridors will also be open from the city of Tokmak in the Zaporizhzhia region and cities of Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Popasna and Hirske in the Luhansk region.- AP Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Tuesday holding negotiations with Russia was the only option for his country although the possibility of having talks was now a “challenge”. But in comments broadcast on national television, he said it was possible that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin would not personally hold talks.- Reuters One of Kremlin chief Vladimir Putin’s closest allies said on Tuesday that claims that Russian forces executed civilians in Bucha were fake products of Ukrainian and Western propaganda aimed at discrediting Russia. “These are fakes that matured in the cynical imagination of Ukrainian propaganda,” Dmitry Medvedev, who served as president from 2008 to 2012 and is now deputy secretary of Russia’s Security Council, said. “They were concocted for vast amounts of money,” Medevedev said.- Reuters Home rental company Airbnb Inc said late on Monday it had suspended operations in Russia and Belarus. “Guests globally will no longer be able to make new reservations for stays or Experiences in Russia or Belarus,” the company said in a statement. “Guests located in Russia or Belarus will not be able to make new reservations on Airbnb.” It said reservations starting on or after April 4 had been cancelled.- Reuters Ukraine’s General Staff reports Tuesday morning that Russia is regrouping its troops and preparing for an offensive in Donbas. “The goal is to establish full control over the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions,” the update posted on the General Staff’s Facebook page says. In the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the Russian military are focusing their efforts on taking control of Popasna and Rubizhne cities, as well as establishing full control over Mariupol, the General Staff said. Other towns and settlements in the two regions are subject to continued shelling. The Russian troops also continue to block Kharkiv, according to the General Staff.- AP Ukrainian forces have retaken key northern terrain, forcing Russian forces to retreat from areas around the city of Chernihiv and north of the capital Kyiv, British military intelligence said on Tuesday. Low-level fighting is likely to continue in some of the recaptured areas, but reduce this week as the remainder of the Russian forces withdraw, the defence ministry said in a regular bulletin on Twitter. Many of the withdrawing Russian units are likely to require significant re-equipping and refurbishment before they redeploy for operations in the country’s east, the ministry added.- Reuters Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will speak to the U.N. Security Council for the first time Tuesday at a meeting certain to focus on what appear to be deliberate killings of civilians in Ukraine by Russian troops. The dead were discovered after Russian forces pulled out of a town on the outskirts of the capital, Kyiv, and have sparked global outrage and vehement denials from the Russian government that it was responsible. The United Kingdom, which holds the council presidency this month, announced late Monday that Zelenskyy would speak at the open meeting already scheduled for Tuesday to discuss the situation in Ukraine.- AP A top official in the global campaign against the use of land mines urged Russia on Monday to stop its troops in Ukraine from laying the weapons that too often kill and maim civilians. Alicia Arango Olmos, Colombia’s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva and this year’s president of the state parties to the 1997 convention banning the production and use of land mines, expressed deep concern at media reports that Russia is using land mines in its war in Ukraine. She pointed to Human Rights Watch, which said on March 29 that Ukrainian explosive ordnance disposal technicians located banned anti-personnel mines in the eastern Kharkiv region a day earlier. The rights group said Russia is known to possess the type of mines that were discovered, but Ukraine doesn’t have them.- AP Facebook owner Meta Platforms briefly restricted hashtags related to civilian deaths in northern Ukraine, where bodies of people shot at close range were found in a town seized back from Russian forces, a company spokesman confirmed on Monday. The killings in Bucha, outside Kyiv, have drawn pledges of further sanctions against Moscow from the West. Meta spokesman Andy Stone said automated systems that scan for violent imagery on Facebook and Instagram, which the company also owns, were responsible for blocking hashtags including #bucha and #buchamassacre. “This happened automatically because of the graphic content people posted using these hashtags. When we were made aware of the issue yesterday, we acted quickly to unblock the hashtags,” he wrote on Twitter.- Reuters The United States plans to seek a suspension of Russia from its seat on the U.N.’s top human rights body amid increasing signs that Russian forces may have committed war crimes in Ukraine, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Monday. Ms. Thomas-Greenfield made the call for Russia to be stripped of its seat in the Human Rights Council in the wake of reports over the weekend about violence against civilians in the town of Bucha, near the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, after Russian forces pulled out. The reports have sparked a wave of outrage and condemnation against Russia. U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday called for a war crimes trial over the alleged atrocities against civilians in Bucha, Ukraine, and said he wants more sanctions imposed on Russia. Calling President Vladimir Putin “a war criminal” and the killings “a war crime,” Mr. Biden told reporters there should be “a war crimes trial.”  To questions on India’s stand with respect to the Russian war in Ukraine, Mr. O’Farrell said the Quad grouping acknowledged that each country had a position on Ukraine.

578,"April 05, 2022",09:56 IST,news,international,‘India shouldn’t increase Russian energy and commodity purchases’: Jen Psaki reiterates Daleep Singh’s message," Days after U.S. Deputy National Security Adviser for International Economics Daleep Singh made a trip to New Delhi to warn India that the purchase of Russian oil at discounted prices would come at the risk of U.S. sanctions, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki reiterated the Biden administration’s message.  Ms. Psaki said the private and public messaging had been that “every country should abide by the sanctions that we [ the U.S.] have announced and that we’re implementing around the world”. Her comment was in response to a question on whether the administration was ramping up pressure on India and China to discourage them from increasing purchases of Russian energy.   “I would note that... energy payments are not sanctioned. That’s a decision made by each individual country, and we’ve been very clear that each country is going to make their own choices even as we have made the decision and other countries have made the decision to ban energy imports,” Ms. Psaki said, before she reiterated Mr. Singh’s message.  “What Daleep did make clear to his counterparts during this visit, was that we don’t believe it’s in India’s interest to accelerate or increase imports of Russian energy and other commodities,” Ms. Psaki said. Emphasising that India’s purchase of Russian oil only constituted 1-2% of its total energy imports, Ms. Psaki said that while in New Delhi, Mr. Singh had explained U.S. sanctions and also had offered U.S. support to end India’s “small percentage of reliance” on Russian oil.

Baskaran. Even as the number of cyber crime cases was on the rise, the cyber crime stations in the district had managed to stop online financial transactions at different stages and helped the victims get back the lost amount.  However, often, the victims come late which resulted in cyber crime accused walk away with the money after withdrawing it.  “Now that the State police have set up the ‘1930’ helpline, people can first contact this number, even before lodging a formal complaint with the nearest police station,” Mr. Baskaran said.  The helpline will deal with any financial fraud relating to debit/credit card, internet banking, mobile banking, insurance-related frauds.  All that the victim needs to do is to give basic details like name, bank account number, mobile number/e-mail id and also the mobile number/e-mail id of the accused through which the money was inadvertently sent.  “If the complaint is registered within 24 hours after the fraud took place, the possibility of freezing the transaction is high,” he added.  As time passes, the online financial transaction crosses several stages and even the accused could withdraw money. “Though the police would register the case and investigate it, it would take a lot of time, manpower to get hold of the accused and recover the money,” he said.  The SP said that the very common way of financial fraud is to call people in the guise of manager of bank and get their bank details, including PIN of debit card or OTP, and then use these details to initiate fund transfer.  Other fraudulent means are by sending links with messages like prize through lottery, extending validity of debit card, which, when clicked, will help the accused hack the phone or computer through which banking details can be stolen.  The SP warned people against installing unverified apps in the mobile phones or clicking links got from strangers. They should never share bank details like account number and security details like PIN, CVV, OTP, expiry date of debit/credit cards with anyone.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/madurai/article65303268.ece

584,"April 08, 2022",20:03 IST,news,cities,Rash driving on the rise in Tiruchi,"  A 46-year-old woman who was walking on the busy Pattabiraman Street in Thennur area a couple of days ago met with an accident after she was knocked down by a speeding motorist causing severe injury on the rear side of her head.  The unidentified motorist who drove the vehicle in a “rash manner” sped away from the spot. The injured woman, a resident of Puthur, was initially rushed to a nearby private hospital and subsequently taken to the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital where she is undergoing treatment.  Police said the accident was due to rash driving with the Traffic Investigation Unit (North) booking a case under IPC sections 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way), 337(causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) against the “unknown” motorist.  The accident has once again turned the spotlight on rash driving by some youths in the city notwithstanding regular enforcement measures executed by the law enforcers.  The accident occurred on the busy stretch that is dotted with private outlets involved in second sale of two-wheelers when the visibility was perfectly clear. “The manner in which several youth ride their two-wheelers in a rash manner on busy thoroughfares is scary. They not only put their own lives at risk but also endanger the lives of rule-abiding motorists”, said C. Balasubramanian, a former member of the District Road Safety Council.   It is not that rash driving was prevalent only on busy thoroughfares including Bharathidasan Salai and Anna Nagar link road but the same could also be noticed in certain residential localities and bylanes leading to the main roads, Mr. Balasubramanian said.   “Some youth derive pleasure driving at a high speed considering it as a heroic performance seldom realising the grave danger it could pose to law abiding road users and pedestrians”, said M.A. Aleem, a city-based senior neurologist. Youngsters while driving should bear in mind that their safety and that of the other road users was of paramount importance. A road accident could not only cause immense agony to the victim but could also shatter their family, said Dr. Aleem.  Police sources said more than 200 cases of rash driving had been booked in the city limits in the last three months alone. The fine amount slapped on each violator was Rs. 1,000. A senior police officer said vehicle checks were being conducted daily at vantage spots including near MGR statue to curtail over-speeding and rash driving by motorists.  The permitted speed limit within the city limits during day time was 30 kilometre per hour and 40 kilometre per hour during night time, the officer said. In some instances, the police had called the parents of the youth found riding at high speed and in a rash manner to sensitise their wards to the dangers involved, he added.  Disciplined driving should be inculcated among students from the time they enter college. This could be done by organising moral classes separately as part of their academic schedule on disciplined driving, road safety and rule adherence, hazards of rash driving and safety of pedestrians, suggested Mr. Aleem and added that licence of those indulging in rash driving should be cancelled.  The City Police could carry out intensive drives especially against rash driving and over-speeding continuously for a period of at least six months which could deter such violations to a large extent, suggests Mr. Balasubramanian. ",R Rajaram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/rash-driving-on-the-rise-in-tiruchi/article65303482.ece

589,"April 08, 2022",19:57 IST,news,cities,Match units of Kaveripattinam struggle with hike in price of raw materials,"  Match stick and match box units of Kaveripattinam are in a dilemma of sorts:  to shut or not shut shop like the units in Kovilpatti that have gone on an indefinite strike unable to meet the costs of production over inflated raw material costs.  The last eight months have seen a consistent rise in the cost of all raw materials, including chemicals and paper boards, used in the manufacturing of match sticks and match boxes, says K.N. Senbagaraman of Krishnagiri District Wax Matches Manufacturers’ Association.   Price of chemicals such as potassium chloride, manganese dioxide, industrial grade animal glue, sulphur, and paraffin wax have gone up. Paper and Duplex board that are used to produce match boxes are scarce, with News Print limited stopping its supplies and a few suppliers meeting the demand, says Mr. Senbagaraman.   According to him, the reasons for the shortage of paper include the reduction in imported paper waste and fall in the waste generation due to COVID-19. With the daily rise in price of duplex boards, the order for board that would take 45 days to materialise hinges on the buyer agreeing to pay the price after inflation on the day of delivery and not the price inked on the day of order, says Mr.Senbagaraman.   Usually price rise of a few raw materials will be balanced by the fall in prices of others. However, the last eight months have only seen a steady rise in prices, he says.   “Closing the units is not easy. If I close my unit, I would lose my workforce, who will go elsewhere. We will have to wait for the price to stabilise, “ he says.  The production costs have gone up worsened by the rise in fuel prices and this has forced match stick manufacturers to reduce the number of sticks on whim. “Some match boxes come with as low as 20 sticks, and nobody really counts a match box costing ₹1. At one point, there were 50 sticks in a box,” says Mr.Senbagaraman.  The inflation in raw materials is made worse by the general fall in the consumption of match boxes, he says. There is a fall in cigarette consumption with the price of cigarettes and the aggressive campaigns against smoking. In its wake, households use match boxes solely for lighting lamps for worship.   One intervention that the match box units believe would help the industry is for the government to bring match boxes under the Weights and Measures Act, with a notification stating that match boxes should be within the specified weight with a standard number of sticks. “Then there will be uniformity, with no cost cutting and will help manufacturers to increase the price of match boxes,” believes Mr.Senbagaraman.   On Friday, members of the match manufacturers’ association met to decide on the future course of action, as the government had sought information from the district’s match units with the prevailing strike in Kovilpatti.

595,"April 08, 2022",19:40 IST,news,cities,Supermarket helps rebuild lives of widows," Life was rather comfortable for Ajitha James till four years ago when it turned upside down all of a sudden. Her husband died of heart attack in Qatar where he was working as a foreman, ending their nine-year-old marriage and leaving her with two little children to take care of. She had no income other than what her husband had saved during his lifetime. That buffer was fast depleting, and the 44-year-old Ms. James was desperate to find a job when the Kanjoor Service Cooperative Bank set up a supermarket exclusively for widows like her. She is among the 13 beneficiaries now running the supermarket opened at Kanjoor earlier this month.  Next month will mark the eighth death anniversary of 45-year-old Sheela Prabhakar’s husband. Her job as a kindergarten teacher coupled with her mother’s income as a housemaid helped her run the family. “I gave up my 18-year-long teaching job with a CBSE school after it became clear that I may be laid off owing to fall in enrollments. That is when the supermarket job came along as a blessing,” said Ms. Prabhakar who is still learning the ropes in the billing section and hence remains a bit tense.  But both of them are happy and excited so as their other colleagues, as the initial days look promising. The beneficiaries were selected from a slew of applicants after being found most in need for a job and without any caste, religion or political considerations.  “We want to give these women a safe, comfortable and secure workplace with a decent income, since the possibility of they being exploited is very real if they are to work in a different environment. We plan to induct more such women in due course,” said M.B. Sasidharan, president, Kanjoor Service Cooperative Bank, and former principal of Al-Ameen College. Since they are new to the job, they are imparted training in association with Rajagiri College of Social Sciences, besides a month’s internship with a stipend in two different supermarkets. All the 13 employees are assured of a basic salary of ₹5,000 even if the firm does zero business. Besides, a commission of 5% will be shared equally between all for daily business in excess of ₹50,000, thus taking their monthly salary to the range of ₹12,000 to ₹13,000. Since its launch on April 3, the supermarket has done business in excess of ₹1 lakh on multiple occasions, while on days it fell below that mark was owing to heavy rain. “We are planning to introduce home delivery shortly. Besides, we take up orders for provisions for events like weddings and facilities like hostels. We have already received the order for supplying provisions to the 100-member Al-Ameen hostel. The idea is to maximise revenue thereby increasing the income of women,” said Mr. Sasidharan.",M P Praveen,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/supermarket-helps-rebuild-lives-of-widows/article65302274.ece
597,"April 08, 2022",19:37 IST,news,cities,"Traders, lessee at Anna vegetable market in Coimbatore heading for a showdown over toll","  Vegetable traders and contractor who had taken on lease the Anna retail vegetable market on Mettupalayam Road here are heading for a showdown over toll rates. The Coimbatore Corporation is attempting to prevent the showdown and broker a truce. As part of the steps to prevent the showdown, Mayor Kalpana Anandakumar, Deputy Mayor R. Vetriselvan along with officials visited the market on Friday. According to sources familiar with the market development, the Coimbatore Corporation after revising the toll rates – the fee that vegetable traders paid to the lessee contractor for shops, vegetable sacks carried into the market and entry of vehicles – auctioned the rights to collect toll at the market. At the time of revising the toll rates, the Corporation’s justification was that the last revision was 10 years ago and in keeping with the present circumstances it was necessary to revise the toll rates. After the revision, when the Corporation auctioned the rights to collect the toll rate in November 2021, it netted ₹1.17 crore in revenue. The year before, the Corporation netted only around ₹70 lakh.  The sources said the revision in toll rates was one of the prime reasons for the Corporation seeing an increase in auction price because the lessee contractor was confident of recouping the money by collecting the revised toll rates. But things did not turn out as expected because the vegetable traders objected to the toll rates revision saying it was way too high. Sources among the vegetable traders said the increase from ₹1.50 to ₹5 for a sack of vegetable, the entry fee for vehicles for every trip and the daily rent for shops had made the trade economically unviable. Prior to the revision, the traders had to pay vehicle entry toll only once a day and that too at any one of the Corporation’s market. But now, they were forced to pay for every time a vehicle entered the market. Stumped by the traders’ revolt, the lessee contractor had asked the Corporation to cancel his auctioning rights and return the money he had paid. Caught in-between was the Corporation, which wanted to protect its revenue and also keep the market functioning. Therefore, it was attempting to broker a truce between the lessee contractor and traders by agreeing to revise some of the toll rates. Corporation Commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara said the Finance and Taxation Committee would look at revising the toll rates and make a recommendation for the Corporation Council to consider. By Mondays’ Council meeting a clear picture could emerge.",Karthik Madhavan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/traders-lessee-at-anna-vegetable-market-in-coimbatore-heading-for-a-showdown-over-toll/article65302757.ece

600,"April 08, 2022",19:26 IST,news,cities,Row over unified Mass spills over into street," Kochi The controversy over the implementation of the unified format of Mass in the Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese took an ugly turn as clashes erupted between the rival groups of laity on the premises of the Ernakulam Bishop’s house on Friday. This followed shortly after priests had a meeting with the Metropolitan Vicar of the archdiocese, Mar Antony Kariyil, and registered their protest against the directive of the head of the church, Cardinal George Alencherry, to implement the unified Mass from Sunday. A circular issued on Thursday had said that the new format of Mass approved by the Synod would come into force in the archdiocese from April 10, Palm Sunday. It had also said that both Mar Kariyil and Cardinal Alencherry would together conduct the Mass in the new format in the Ernakulam Cathedral Basilica on Sunday. Lay activists supporting the official leadership of the Syro Malabar Church said that one of their members was beaten up by the faction supporting the dissident priests. They threatened to file a police case against the alleged atrocity. However, the rival faction of the laity supporting the priests countered the allegation, accusing the other faction of triggering the tension through deliberate provocation and trespass into the compound of the Bishop’s house. Later, Fr. Mathew Kilukkan, public relations officer of the archdiocese, issued a statement saying that the old format of the Mass would continue in the archdiocese. The statement claimed that in the meeting with the priests, Mar Kariyil had revealed that he was compelled to sign the circular issued on Thursday and that it was prepared in advance by the curia (administrative office) at Mount St. Thomas, the headquarters of the Syro Malabar Church. The Bishop was asked to send his letterhead, seal, and digital signature with the directive not to discuss the matter even with his own office. The statement said that this proved that the Bishop signed the circular under duress, and therefore, it was not canonically valid.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/row-over-unified-mass-spills-over-into-street/article65303173.ece
601,"April 08, 2022",19:22 IST,news,cities,"After a slowdown, organ donations and transplants picking up in T.N."," Organ donations and transplants are slowly picking up in Tamil Nadu. The number is inching towards the pre-pandemic levels, with March alone registering donations from 12 deceased donors.  COVID-19 slowed down organ donations and transplants. The factors at play included lockdown and the focus of government hospitals on COVID-19 management. According to the Transplant Authority of Tamil Nadu (TRANSTAN), 745 major organs and 352 tissues were harvested from 161 donors in the last two years during the pandemic — from May 2020 to April 6, 2022. The number of donations increased from one in May 2020 to five-six cases in October-November 2020. It went up further to 10 cases in October 2021. “The donations picked up before the Omicron-induced third wave of infections when we crossed the 10-donor mark in a month. We have almost reached the pre-pandemic levels now,” said R. Kanthimathy, member-secretary of TRANSTAN. In March this year, 68 organs and tissues were harvested from 12 donors. In fact, there has been a reversal of roles, she said. “Government hospitals (GHs) went to private hospitals and other GHs to retrieve organs and utilised them.” In the last one year, GHs utilised kidneys from private hospitals. While Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH) utilised seven, Government Rajaji Hospital, Madurai, utilised three and Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital utilised two kidneys, she said. The latest organ donation took place at Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital, Tiruchi, on April 7. While the hospital utilised one kidney, the other was allocated to Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital, officials said. What is the need of the hour? “Brain death identification should be converted into brain dead donation. This is the most crucial step. Maintenance of the brain dead person is the gray area. There is a need for a multidisciplinary approach. The first 48 hours is the golden period during which conversion and retrieval of organs should take place,” Dr. Kanthimathy said. In a step towards improving organ donations and transplants, TRANSTAN has asked all government medical colleges to take steps to obtain transplant licences. As on date, 12 government hospitals and the Regional Institute of Ophthalmology hold transplant licences. “We have asked all district hospitals to get licences to serve as non-transplant organ retrieval centres to facilitate organ donation,” she said. Official sources said road accidents and fatalities reduced during the pandemic. The survival rate of persons involved in accidents has improved with good emergency care across the State. E. Theranirajan, dean of RGGGH, said during a recent workshop on Deceased Organ Donation that during the pandemic, their concentration was fully on COVID-19 management. “We are taking measures to resume the programme. We are setting up a separate intensive care unit for maintenance of brain dead persons. There are a number of challenges in maintaining a brain dead person. So we have formed a special team comprising doctors from neuro-medicine, neuro-surgery, anaesthesia, nephrology and medicine. We have insisted that brain death needs to be certified whether or not there is organ donation,” he said. While kidney transplants were being performed, he said they were taking measures to take up liver transplantation too.",Serena Josephine M.,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/after-a-slowdown-organ-donations-and-transplants-picking-up-in-tn/article65303237.ece

Mr. Koya raised a query about the contractors failing to complete the projects way beyond the allotted time. He demanded that the Corporation direct the contractors to complete the works on time.  Deputy Mayor C.P.

As coal supply to the TTPS, which is being done through ships and trains, has been badly affected due to a range of “administrative reasons”, operating all five units has become the toughest task for authorities. The TTPS is in need of 9,000 tonnes of coal every day to operate all the units. “The situation prevailing in the TTPS is frustrating. When we faced similar situation in the third week of March, four units had to be stopped and the coal-laden ships arrived from Odhisha bailed us out from the precarious situation. Now, we have been left to face similar situation,” said sources in the TTPS. Since the coal stock available at the TTPS was sufficient for operating only one unit, the first unit alone was generating power, they said. “We used to have a stock of up to two lakh tonnes of coal. On Friday, we had only 15,000 tonnes of coal and hence four units had to be stopped. If the situation (demand for power) becomes serious, one more unit can be operated with the coal available in our yard.

622,"April 08, 2022",18:29 IST,news,cities,Detailed project report for new Cauvery bridge to be ready within a month,"  The Detailed Project Report (DPR) for the proposed new bridge across the Cauvery river in the city is expected to be finalised within a month, according to sources in the Highways Department.  The government had decided to build a new bridge across the river after the existing one developed huge gaps in the expansion joints.  Built in 1976, the bridge across the river is a vital link, connecting Tiruchi city with Srirangam and caters to a huge volume of traffic. Over the past few years motorists have been complaining over the severe jolts experienced by them while driving on the bridge. In September 2018, the department officials used advanced guniting method to repair the damaged edges. The work was taken up at expansion joints where broken edges were identified. Yet gaps keep surfacing on the expansion joints of the bridge. Following the complaints, officials of the Highways Research Station had conducted a study. Due to the heavy and continuous traffic for over four decades, damages were found in the “dirt and wing wall of abutments,” and scouring of piers besides wear and tear of the elastometric bearings in all supports. The riverbed around the foundation had also undergone scouring in at least nine piers.  The government has already sanctioned ₹6.50 crore to take up a major rehabilitation of the existing bridge and the work was already under way. Meanwhile, the department had recently completed soil tests on the riverbed to determine to what depth the foundation has to be laid for the proposed new bridge. The tests would be followed by a land survey, finalisation of the alignment and preparation of estimates, the sources indicated.  Though the alignment of the new bridge is yet to be finalised, it is likely to be built on the upstream side of the existing bridge. The new bridge would entail an investment of ₹130 crore approximately, besides land acquisition costs. According to available indications, the project may involve some land acquisition. The existing bridge would be fully rehabilitated and retained to cater to traffic for vehicles entering the city from Mambazhasalai, while the new bridge would be meant for traffic on the opposite direction, the sources indicated.",S.Ganesan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/detailed-project-report-for-new-cauvery-bridge-to-be-ready-within-a-month/article65303077.ece

Moving a resolution in the council meeting held on Friday, he said the VOC Port, which should have paid ₹ 15 crore as property tax to the corporation in the past 10 years alone, and the 117 firms having their offices in the port area were not paying the tax to the corporation even though a judgement delivered in the court in this connection had backed the corporation. The council unanimously should resolve to collect property tax from VOC Port and the private firms having their offices in the port area, said Mr. Jegan, who was overwhelmingly supported in this connection. The meeting also resolved to repair the badly damaged roads of Thoothukudi and organise intensive mass cleaning operations during the second and the fourth Saturdays.  When the meeting’s agendas were being read, AIADMK councillor and Opposition leader Veerabahu wanted to know if the motors purchased for pumping out stagnant rainwater at several places of the town were being maintained properly. Mr. Jegan replied that the coastal town, which was experiencing flooding due to the poor planning of the official machinery during the previous AIADMK regime, was being provided with proper infrastructure to mitigate these issues during northeast monsoon this year.  As Mr. Veerabahu wanted the council to adopt a resolution against the re-opening of the sealed Sterlite Copper unit, the Mayor said the copper manufacturing unit would not be re-opened as the Tamil Nadu government was firm in its decision of permanently closing down the unit.  Problem started when Mr. Veerabahu wanted the council to discuss about the proposed property tax hike and Mr. Jegan replied that it could be discussed when the new tax slabs were finalised by the State Government and implemented.

630,"April 08, 2022",18:12 IST,news,cities,It is atrocious that an artist is not allowed to perform in a temple based on religious belief or non-belief: TM Krishna," Carnatic vocalist, composer and author T.M. Krishna will render verses of Sree Narayana Guru at Hosanna Mount, Pala, on April 9. Hosanna Mount is dedicated to the memory of Joseph Pulikkunnel, writer and social reformer.  The concert is being organised by the Backwaters Collective, Nool Archives, Hosanna Mount and Uru Art Harbour and supported by DC Books. Mr. Krishna talks to The Hindu about the significance of singing the Guru’s verses against the backdrop of a surge of caste- and religious-based discrimination against artistes in certain temples in Kerala.  Edited excerpts from the interview.  
It is atrocious that an artist is not allowed to perform in a temple based on his/her religious belief or non-belief. A temple has been considered as a place where, as far as culture and music are concerned, people of various faiths or no belief at all have participated in the arts and culture. It is shocking that this is happening in Kerala.
 
Cultural conversations and conversations on various faiths have to be nurtured. No religion is an independent one. Religions have always spoken to each other, have always shared with each other, there may have been disagreements. But there has been that coming together in commonality.
After all, every belief is about finding goodness in yourself. I think the voice of Guru becomes very significant in that context.
I have already rendered verses where he is talking about who is god? Is it Allah, Jesus, Buddha, Krishna? So, when he says who it is, he is saying it is all and it is none. We are having this concert where faiths are going to intermingle.
 
It is three to four years now since we started the ‘Guru project’ to bring the Guru’s compositions, poetry rather, into the Carnatic music concert platform. It started off with the first concert in Bombay (Mumbai).
My concert in Pala will predominantly be on the Guru’s compositions on various subjects. In his poetry, you can see utter faith in a deity or a goddess, at the same time he is philosophical.
You can see subversion of mainstream hegemonic systems. Guru is someone who got together the social conversation and the spiritual conversation and did not run away from either.
 
Over the last three years, along with Perumal Murugan [author], we have brought in a lot of Tamil compositions, which are on nature, social themes, such as discrimination, manual scavenging, etc., on the Carnatic music platform.
There are compositions written by Islamic Sufi saints, compositions on Jesus, in Tamil and Malayalam. It is also about dialect. Whether it is Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada or Telugu, the dialect is of the privileged. Even the dialect needs to be challenged.
In fact, Perumal Murugan uses the dialect of the Kongunadu, which is not generally used in Carnatic music. We need widening of content, dialect, multi-religiosity and contemporariness in Carnatic music.

632,"April 08, 2022",18:10 IST,news,cities,WCCB report highlights oversights in official probe into elephant poaching cases," A 2019 Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) report has highlighted serious oversights on the part of the Tamil Nadu Forest Department in investigating elephant poaching cases in a number of districts, including the Nilgiris and Coimbatore. The report, a copy of which is with The Hindu, details instances of underreporting of poaching cases, registering of cases in the Coimbatore division in a “casual and careless manner”, failure to include the names of the main accused in the cases filed, including ivory traders and middlemen, poor investigation practices and follow-ups for over a decade. The WCCB investigated the cases in Megamalai, Valparai, the Sigur Range and Kotagiri in the Nilgiris, Sirumugai and Mettupalayam in Coimbatore and also the forest ranges in Theni in 2015. Based on the WCCB report, tusks have been collected from poachers in many parts of the Nilgiri biosphere reserve, including Kotagiri, Kallar, Bhavani and Coonoor. “For the murder of three elephants at three different times by the same accused person, only one case was registered against them [sic] in the Sigur range of the Coimbatore division,” reads a portion of the report submitted to the Madras High Court. “…suggestions for rectifying the same was communicated to the Tamil Nadu Forest Department. However, the main accused, one Aji Bright, who bought the entire ivory...more than 300 kg from Tamil Nadu, was not at all included in any of the cases,” the report states. The WCCB has also identified key businessmen, industrialists and entrepreneurs from across India who are known to have purchased ivory, obtained through poaching, from the key accused identified by it. One of the accused arrested in Sigur told the WCCB that he had killed eight elephants. The WCCB states that based on his testimony, at least eight cases should have been registered. “On the contrary, the cases registered by the Tamil Nadu Forest Department is nowhere near the quantity of ivory traded,” the report adds. According to conservationists, the State’s elephant population has declined dramatically from over 4,000 Asian elephants in 2012 to less than 2,800 in 2017, based on the reply to a question under the Right to Information Act from the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change in 2022. The number of unnatural elephant deaths does not tally with the huge decrease in the elephant population, conservationists say. The report was prepared and submitted in 2019. Activists, including Sharath Babu, a wildlife activist from Karnataka, have voiced concerns over the formation of a four-member committee to look into the elephant deaths in Tamil Nadu over the last year by the Forest Department. The committee comprises three Indian Forest Service officers, including one of the rank of Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, and just one member of a non-governmental organisation from Coimbatore. “The officers who were in charge when the alleged oversights were committed by the Forest Department while investigating the cases have been included as members of the committee, which on paper, does not seem to be impartial...,” Mr. Babu said. Another conservationist from the Nilgiris questioned the rationale behind the Forest Department forming a committee to probe the elephant deaths when the High Court had already ordered the formation of a special investigation team. “The only way to ensure transparency in this probe is to make sure that an independent third-party organisation, or an SIT as recommended by the High Court, looks into this issue. The Forest Department itself has been indicted by the WCCB report for failing to properly investigate these deaths,” added the conservationist. When contacted, Syed Muzammil Abbas, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, refused to comment on the report. “I do not want to comment on this issue,” he told The Hindu.",Rohan Premkumar,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/wccb-report-highlights-oversights-in-probe-into-elephant-poaching-cases/article65302563.ece

Evidently, nobody has paid attention to the notice on the bus stand walls urging people to avoid relieving themselves in public. Things are fractionally more bearable inside the terminus, which houses four segregated pay-and-use toilets at each corner of the campus, and two open facilities on the side.  Here, the smell is a notch less due to the liberal application of bleaching powder, but with flies drawn to the open garbage bins in use by the eateries here, the effort at sanitation is negated. In a place that sees a footfall of one lakh people daily, the toilets, maintained by the Corporation, are struggling to keep up. “Passengers coming from long distance will naturally want to freshen up after their journey before they proceed into town. Though the pay-and-use toilets are fully functional, they should be cleaned more often. At the same time, the public should also be aware of how to utilise the conveniences in a hygienic manner,” a bus stand official told The Hindu.  At one of the gates, close to a milk booth, the door to one of the two Corporation toilets is missing. This has however not deterred people from using the convenience, making it an eyesore. “Insufficient cleaning of the toilet pans is most common reason for the bad smell. Besides this, a build-up of solid waste in the drainage system could also add to the problem. Despite the rules, many people still flush soiled sanitary napkins or children’s diapers down the toilets, and this leads to blockages in the main drainage system,” said sanitation expert M. Subburaman.  He said that more eco-friendly solutions such as the bio-digester system that uses bacteria to treat human waste and reduces the chances of blocked drains could be considered for public conveniences. “But this concept hasn’t found many takers yet in Tiruchi. Both the conservancy workers and toilet users need to follow standard hygiene protocols to keep existing facilities in good condition,” said Mr. Subburaman. When contacted, a senior Corporation official said that toilet maintenance at the Central Bus Stand was being leased out to private operators. “We will look into improving cleanliness standards and repair the damaged toilets in the terminus as soon as possible,” he said.",Nahla Nainar,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/central-bus-stand-public-toilets-raise-a-stink/article65302576.ece

643,"April 08, 2022",17:44 IST,news,cities,HC quashes charge memo against three government doctors," The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has quashed charge memo issued to three government doctors from Madurai. The charge memo was issued on the charge that the doctors had not provided proper treatment to a patient in 2012 who was a remand prisoner. The court was hearing the petitions filed by the doctors: M.N. Karthi, V. Jeyakodish and C. Saravanan Robinson of the Madurai Government Rajaji Hospital. The doctors challenged the charge memo issued to them by the Director of Medical Education. The petitioners said that the allegations levelled against them that proper treatment was not provided to the remand prisoner was baseless. He was admitted to the GRH by the Thilagar Thidal policemen. It was said that the prisoner was beaten up by the police. Justice S. Srimathy took note of the fact that the charge memo was issued in 2018. It was a belated one and the same was liable to be quashed, the judge said. Also, the prisoner died within 36 hours after getting admitted to the hospital. The death of the remand prisoner cannot be attributed as negligence on the part of doctors. The postmortem report said the cause of death was occlusion of feeding vessels of heart left coronary artery which means that there was a block in the vessel which caused the death. The judge observed that from the description the prisoner had chronic ailment and had not approached the doctors in time for treatment. Therefore, the petitioners cannot be blamed. There was no misconduct as alleged in the charge memo. Therefore, the court is of the considered view that the charge as stated in the charge memo is not a misconduct and the court is inclined to quash the charge memo issued to the three petitioners, the judge observed.

Like its other clubs and hi-tech laboratories, the school management has established the state-of-the-art indoor shooting range where the students will be trained by qualified trainers in using the standard rifles and pistols meant for sports.  “We started this school in 1992 with 66 students. Now, we have more than 2,000 students who are being trained in sophisticated facilities like creative and digital laboratories, robotics lab, image minds etc. to get them ready for the digital age. These facilities equip them with employable qualities from the school days. Since we accord importance to sports activities also besides helping them get academic excellence, we’ve created the Bell School Rifle Club with safe, specialised indoor shooting range facility,” says shooter Gunasingh Chelladurai, correspondent of the school and renowned industrialist from Bell Group of Companies.  He says getting trained in a shooting range will immensely improve concentration of the students and stabilise their soul and mind. Since the school has appointed a qualified trainer, the students can participate in national and international level shooting competitions. “The Government of India appoints these meritorious sportspersons in most of the government institutions including Indian Railway, Indian Army, Police and nationalized banks. They also have chances to get appointments in ‘Group C’ and ‘Group D’ category through direct recruitment,” Mr. Gunasingh said.  Since getting trained in private indoor shooting ranges will be a costly affair for the children, the new facility established in Bell School is a boon to the children, the parents here opine.  “I believe that this sport immensely increases your concentration and self confidence. When an indoor rifle club was opened on Tirunelveli – Kanniyakumari highway near Nanguneri, I had to take my children to the premises, wait there till the end of the training session and take them back to my house. It is a wonderful opportunity for my children, especially for my daughter, as a state-of-the-art indoor shooting range is opened in her school itself,” said a trader, who is also a shooter.   The facility is to be inaugurated on April 13 by T.P. Suresh Kumar, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Tirunelveli City East in the presence of Bell School Sports Director Sanjay Gunasingh and the directors of the school.  “This is open to Class 5 to 12 students (students in the age group of 10 to 16 years) of Bell School,” said Mr. Gunasingh.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/hi-tech-indoor-shooting-range-in-school/article65302672.ece

653,"April 08, 2022",17:05 IST,news,cities,Visakhapatnam Port registers a minor drop in cargo handling,"  Battling COVID-19 pandemic and a sluggish market, Visakhapatnam Port Authority recorded a cargo handling turnover of 69.03 million tonnes for the financial year ending 2021-22. This was about 1% lower than the corresponding previous year, when the port handled 69.84 million tonnes of cargo. Though the port registered some good growth in handling of steam coal, thermal coal and containers, there has been a drop in its core products such as crude oil, iron ore and coking coal. According to the Chairman of VPA, K. Rama Mohana Rao, the drop in the iron ore from 188.61 lakh tonnes to 145.59, was mainly due to the fall in prices in the international market and the drop in coking coal from 54.23 lakh tonnes to 44.28 lakh tonnes is due the Union government asking the coal users to buy domestic coal under the Atma Nirbhar Bharat initiative, to reduce the outflow of foreign exchange. In crude oil handling, there is a drop of about 11%, over the previous year. On the brighter side, there has been a substantial increase in the handling of steam coal and it has gone up from 50.75 lakh tonnes to 70.05 lakh tonnes. Thermal coal has gone up from 6.95 lakh tonnes to 25.96 lakh tonnes and containers have gone up from 81.78 lakh tonnes to 85.83 lakh tonnes. Though the port has slipped from third position to fourth in the major ports ranking, efforts are on to modernise it and we expect to lodge a good growth from next year and take the capacity to over 77 million tonnes in the next couple of years, said Mr. Rama Mohana Rao. Keeping in view of the change in cargo pattern and policies such as Atma Nirbhar Bharat, the port has decided to modify its cargo profile. We are now focussing on handling of food grains and preliminary talks are on with investors to build storage facilities with an investment of about ₹200-300 crore. “We have a few existing godowns that are being refurbished and we will take food grains in a big way. This apart, our crude oil handling will go up, as HPCL has already expanded its capacity from eight million tonnes to 15 million tonnes,” he said. According to Mr. Rama Mohana Rao, the proposed import of bauxite by Anrak Aluminium is also going to have a positive impact by next year. We are in talks with Anrak and we will allocate one berth to them to handle cape size vessels, which could vary between 1.5 to 2 lakh tonnes. One of our berths in the outer harbour can accommodate cape size vessels and that will be given to them, said Mr. Rama Mohana Rao. “This apart we have entered into a bilateral agreement with Tangent of Tamil Nadu and NMDC for handing their material. These should pep up our capacity in the coming years,” he said. On competition with private ports, the Chairman of VPA said that the port is working to improve its efficiency by modernisation and would develop capacities to compete with the best. Our idea is to reduce logistic cost and turn around time for the clients, for which we have embarked on multiple projects to address these aspects, he said. Some of the projects include mechanisation of WQ 7 and 8 berths under PPP at a cost of about ₹288 crore, revamping of railway yard, construction of covered sheds and repair of ORS and LPG jetties.

654,"April 08, 2022",16:56 IST,news,cities,Covid-19: NGO finds a way to improve learning retention among children in rural Karnataka," An out-of-the-box thinking, which led to educated senior students mentoring their juniors during the Covid-19 pandemic, has resulted in better learning retention in a few villages in Mysuru district.  Conceived by Pratham Mysore, an NGO working in the field of education, the Student Mentoring Programme (SMP) has caught the imagination of a few educationists who intend to introduce mentoring as a compulsory subject in the B.Ed course.  Explaining the genesis of Student Mentoring Programme, Ashvini Ranjan, who is pioneering Pratham Mysore’s activities in the region, said that  the NGO had launched a Model Village Programme in 2017. Under this programme, it adopted Hyaknur, Mavinahalli, Sujjalur and Muthathi in T. Narsipura taluk to shore up the learning abilities of children in government schools.  The concept of model village programme was based on the premise that education of a child is not the responsibility of schools alone, but is a collaborative effort of the entire community.  The initiative was delivering positive results, but came to a halt due to COVID-19. The closure of schools from March 2020 caused discontinuity in learning.  Given the absence of a conducive environment at homes in villages for education as compared to their counterparts in towns and cities, the threat of students falling behind their urban counterparts was genuine and was bound to have negative repercussions in the long run, said Mr. Ashvini Ranjan.  The challenges faced by rural children during such disruptions could become unsurmountable in future as various studies, including Pratham’s Annual Status Education Report (ASER), indicate that more than 50% of primary school children in rural areas are three levels behind grade-appropriate learning, he added.  Hence, Pratham Mysore introduced the Student Mentoring Program (SMP) in which one reasonably educated adult – called a mentor – is paired with one student in a village to guide and motivate them besides discussing subjects of importance and interest to the children. The concept is rooted in the belief that continuity of learning holds the key to eliminating any learning loss. Lessons were printed on paper and delivered to the homes of children in the four villages. Short videos were shared with children who had smartphones.  So, when the schools reopened in February 2022 after a gap of nearly two years, an assessment indicated the positive results of the Student Mentoring Programme.  Students in the age group of 6 to 14 years were administered tests in the presence of village leaders. But to determine a loss or a gain, it was necessary to compare with a group outside the experimental area; children in two other villages too were administered the same test for comparison. The results indicated that 27% of the Model Village Programme children could read a grade-appropriate English lesson as against 13% outside the programme; 91% of children covered in the programme could read their lesson in Kannada as against 46% outside the programme. The test also indicated that 58% performed better in maths as against 12% outside the programme, said Mr. Ashvini Ranjan.  Student mentoring has now become a part of the Model Village Programme and Pratham Mysore is extending the initiative to eight more villages. The model is easy to replicate with almost no big financial investment and is expected to go a long way in shoring up the quality of learning among students in rural areas, he added.",The Hindu Bureau,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/covid-19-ngo-finds-a-way-to-improve-learning-retention-among-children-in-rural-karnataka/article65302679.ece

Rajkumar, a former automobile showroom executive who now runs an advertising agency in the city, has a passion for creating video content on a gamut of issues in his spare time. Moved by the war between Russia and Ukraine, he produced the musical video Yudham Vendam (We don’t want War), that was launched by Member of Parliament S. Thirunavukkarasar last month to positive reviews. “When the war began, most of the media coverage focused on the plight of the innocent Ukrainian civilians caught in the crossfire. The war had turned their life upside down. I wrote a song related to this, and had Orathanadu Gopu sing it. The entire project took 10 days to complete, and has got good feedback so far,” Mr. Rajkumar told The Hindu. Spending his savings on video production, Mr. Rajkumar brings out approximately three projects in a year, either as musical videos or short films, which he streams on his YouTube channel. “Each venture costs me up to ₹50,000, but I am not interested in monetising my content,” he said. Mr. Rajkumar, the son of teachers, studied to be an educator as well. But he decided to work in sales after he was unable to secure a government teaching post. Clearly a multi-faceted person, he has also moonlighted as an actor in Tamil films such as Kayal (2013) and Vada Chennai (2018).  “It was director Prabhu Solomon who inspired me to follow my passion for music production and public service messages,” said Mr. Rajkumar. “When I went to request him to launch my debut song, a romantic ballad, he told me that while there were many people who could produce this type of work, there were few who would be willing to focus on social issues in a meaningful way. So I decided to change direction from then onwards.” Among the topics he has worked on are water conservation, corruption and COVID-19 awareness. There are some off-beat ones took such as the video Dhosai, with a catchy song on the many varieties of this south Indian traditional dish.  “Not many professional singers are willing to be part of social message videos; I am lucky that singers like Orathanadu Gopu, Chinnaponnu and Velmurugan have agreed to be part of my projects,” said Mr. Rajkumar. This year, he is planning to bring out videos on the Tamil language and government schools in the state. “Over two lakh viewers follow my work on YouTube.

While the daytime celebrations were marked by the performance of ancient tribal rituals, the evenings were filled with modern music. David Angu and The Tribe, one of the foremost musical bands of Arunachal, brought the house down with their performance. Other singers from the State — Delong Padung, Chorun Mugli, among others — who combine elements of modern Western music with tribal folk, gave the audience a much-needed break from the grimness of the pandemic.  Arunachali music is trending these days, with singers regularly getting featured on RollingStone India. The younger generation seems hooked on the new brand of music that mixes diverse musical traditions with traditional folk songs.  YouTube hits A few weeks before Nyokum Yullo, I had talked music, culture and life with David Angu in an Itanagar café. Born in Aalo in West Siang district, Angu first picked up the guitar when he was in Class II. By the time he was in Class VI, he had formed his first band, Megawatt, which was all heavy metal. But when Angu created David Angu and The Tribe in 2018, he circled back to music that’s close to his Galo tribal roots. How did the switch happen? “When I was in college in Shillong, listening to Galo songs would leave me homesick,” he says. Realising its worth anew, he wanted to preserve the music. His band’s most popular song, ‘Ho Delo’, with more than 392,000 views on YouTube, is a rendition of an ancient folk song, with a bluesy touch to it. Angu says that the song is about “not forgetting one’s roots, where your forefathers came from, your culture, and to ensure that you visit your villages.”  He wants to popularise Arunachali music in India and among the younger generation of the State. Adding diverse styles to traditional music can be the way ahead, he says, citing the example of Arunachali singer-songwriter Chorun Mugli, whose song, ‘Kala Kala’, in his native Nyishi language, has over a million views on YouTube. ‘Kala Kala’ is almost the unofficial State anthem now, a staple of house parties and picnics where karaoke sessions are a must. Ancient melodies Another song by Mugli that has been gaining traction is the upbeat number, ‘Jajin Ja’, variations of which have been sung by Arunachal’s Tani group of tribes at agricultural festivals for centuries. Mugli says he was motivated to make his version “to promote our linguistic culture and showcase our traditional festival.” Omak Komut is among the senior musicians from the State who too makes use of the different abangs or songs of his Adi tribe in his music. There are abangs for every occasion — from prayers for a good harvest to chants for driving away evil spirits. Songs that the miri — an Adi shaman — sings can differ from the ponung sung by women while dancing. Komut borrows elements from them to create his own brand of music, which is much appreciated in Arunachal and the Northeast. Komut was part of the State troupe that performed at the Republic Day parade in New Delhi in 1994. His band, the Omak Komut Collective, is a fixture at Independence Day celebrations in the State. Ready again Komut is also a priest of the Donyi Polo faith, and makes use of ceremonial brass instruments such as the mulku and mulli. The other instruments he uses are the yoksa, a traditional sword, and the kiiring, which is a kind of ghungroo. They act like metronomes, helping him keep beat. As someone who has no background in modern Western music, Komut relies more on the vibes that his instruments give him than on drums or guitars. All these musicians have been badly hit by the pandemic, which resulted in most live events being cancelled in the past two years. Many of them went online with new content but livestreaming events don’t pay as well as live gigs do. Singer-songwriter Carolina Norbu says the situation is especially difficult for artists who “cannot afford high-tech gear to record at home.”  David Angu and The Tribe were to perform at Nagaland’s Hornbill Festival in December, but the band cancelled its plans because of the widespread protests against the killing of civilians by the Indian Army. It is only recently, with the Omicron wave abating, that gigs are making a cautious comeback.  The celebrations for the 50th year of Arunachal Pradesh’s founding kicked off in January with both Angu and Mugli performing at the inaugural event at Ziro in Lower Subansiri district. After being homebound for two years, Komut is eager to take to the stage. Donning the majestic bolup — his headgear — for a photo shoot, he declares, “I’m ready to perform.

The letter is signed as ‘Sahishnu Hindu’ (tolerant Hindu). The envelope in which the letter came has a seal from Bhadravati in Shivamogga district, Kumvee said.  The writer has not lodged a complaint with the police. “When the Home Minister himself is trying to fan communal tension in Karnataka by making false claims, what credibility do the police have for me to file a complaint,” Kumvee told The Hindu.  He came down heavily on Kannada news television for fanning tension in Karnataka and targeting writers like him who were speaking out against it. “If anybody is responsible for the death of M.M.

Stating that direct and indirect tax collections were rising and had good buoyancy, Mr. Bajaj said it meant that the corporate sector was also doing well, and that India’s tax-to-GDP ratio could be the “highest ever” in the current year. The Budget 2022-23 has proposed that the concessional 15% corporate tax rate would be available for one more year till March 2024 for newly incorporated manufacturing units. While reducing the corporate tax rate in September 2019, the government had said that any new domestic company incorporated on or after October 1, 2019, making fresh investment in manufacturing, would have an option to pay income-tax at the rate of 15% if they commenced their production on or before March 31, 2023. However, these companies would not be allowed to avail of any income tax exemption/ incentive. “Our tax:GDP ratio went down to below 10% in the year we brought down tax rates, but it has now started coming up. I will not be surprised if in the current year, my tax-to-GDP ratio is the highest ever for direct and indirect taxes taken together,” Mr. Bajaj said at an Assocham event here.

664,"February 04, 2022",11:18 IST,business,budget,"Budget growth-oriented but poses fiscal challenges, says Moody’s"," Moody’s Investors Service said the Union Budget presented on February 1, 2022, is growth-oriented, credit positive for many issuers but the budgetary provisions pose fiscal challenges.“Focus [of the budget] on capital expenditure supports near-term growth, poses challenges to longer-term fiscal consolidation. India’s budget projects a slight narrowing in the central government deficit,” Moody’s said. While conservative budget assumptions leave room for the government to respond to prevailing macroeconomic and pandemic risks over the next year, the path toward the government’s medium-term deficit target is undefined, it said.“Public spending to remain high for highways and railways; sovereign green bonds to mobilize funding for public projects to reduce carbon intensity. High infrastructure spending is positive for companies in this sector. The government also announced plans to issue green bonds, and increased incentives to support solar power,” it added. Moody’s said the continued government spending on infrastructure projects will drive demand for key user industries which is a credit positive.“Conditions will remain supportive for most nonfinancial companies in fiscal 2023. The budget is positive for steel, cement, housing, and solar photovoltaic (PV) module manufacturers, as well as downstream oil companies,” it said. The support of the budget for medium, small and micro enterprises is credit positive for banks and nonbank financial companies.“The expansion of the quantum of and period for securing government-guaranteed working loans for medium, small and micro enterprises (MSMEs) will support banks’ and nonbank financial companies’ (NBFCs) asset quality. Introduction of the digital rupee will further increase payment efficiency and financial inclusion,” it said. It said the stock market listing of Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) is credit positive for its financial flexibility, governance, and risk management. Economic expansion bolstered by government spending will stimulate demand for insurance cover, it said. Moody’s said thebudget projects a narrowing in the central government deficit to 6.4% of GDP in fiscal 2022 from an estimated 6.9% in fiscal 2021.“The budget is characterized by a continued emphasis on rising capital expenditure to sustain growth momentum near term, as the economy continues to rebound from its pandemic trough. While conservative budget assumptions leave room for the government to respond to prevailing macroeconomic and pandemic risks over the next year, the path toward the government’s medium-term deficit target of 4.5% of GDP by fiscal 2025 remains undefined,” it said. “Strong economic growth drives revenue outperformance in fiscal 2021, but pandemic shock deters fiscal consolidation. The government assumes that inflation-adjusted real GDP growth for fiscal 2021 will come in at 9.2% year on year, following growth of 13.6% in the first half,” it added. “Mirroring the government’s conservative growth assumptions, the revised budget estimates for fiscal 2021 show revenue receipts growing only 27.2%, which leaves some scope for further gains once the fiscal accounts are tallied at the end of March 2022. The central government recorded a 67.2% rise in revenue receipts over the first eight months of the fiscal year,” it said. To accommodate this large increase, the government projects spending not related to capital expenditure to decline 1.8% in nominal terms and 1.5 percentage points as a share of GDP, reflecting the cessation of stimulus measures and the government’s view of the waning impact of price pressures.In particular, it projects subsidies for fertilizer, food, and fuel to decline 26.6% to ₹3.2 trillion (1.2% of GDP) from ₹4.3 trillion (1.9% of GDP) in fiscal 2021; on account of the government’s provision of free grain and pulses during the pandemic, the subsidy bill had previously ballooned to ₹7.1 trillion (3.6% of GDP) in fiscal 2020. Total central government expenditure is projected to decline to 15.3% of GDP, driving much of the narrowing of the deficit, it said. Relative to the government’s assumption of 11.1% nominal GDP growth for fiscal 2022, its projection of a 6.0% rise in revenue receipts appears achievable, balancing buoyant corporate tax, income tax, and goods and sales tax (GST) receipts against declines in dividends and other non-tax revenue, it said.“Consequently, the budget projects revenue receipts to fall marginally to 8.6% of GDP from 9.0% in the revised estimates for fiscal 2021,” it said. In contrast to previous budgets in which disinvestment receipts were seen as a key source of funding, the projected contribution of capital receipts for fiscal 2022 has diminished greatly, to INR650 billion (0.3% of GDP) from as high as INR2.1 trillion (1.0% of GDP) in fiscal 2020, Moody’s said. It said the prominent risks to the deficit target of 6.4% of GDP for fiscal 2022 include the pandemic and inflation.“Both of these factors could spur additional spending to support the economy, although execution risks related to capital expenditure could dampen overall spending. The announced budget is consistent with our view of gradual fiscal consolidation and a continuing increase in government debt through the next year to around 91% of GDP,” it said. It said the longer-term spending pressures weigh on prospective improvements in India’s fiscal profile.Moody’s said that although Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman reiterated the government’s intention to meet its previously announced medium-term deficit target of 4.5% of GDP by fiscal 2025, she did not specify a road map to achieve that goal.“Given the government’s stated ambitions to ramp up infrastructure development and promote inclusive growth, while meeting other commitments such as those related to climate change, expenditure pressures are likely to rise beyond the near-term retrenchment from a pandemic-driven stimulus,” it said. Despite the pullback in spending from a peak in fiscal 2020, the budget is still larger as a share of GDP than the average over the 10 years before the pandemic. Moreover, rising interest rates could push up already high debt servicing costs and worsen debt affordability, as measured by interest payments to revenue. The government did not foreshadow any potentially significant measures to broaden the tax base, appearing to rely on healthy tax buoyancy and increasing tax compliance to drive revenue, at least through the forthcoming budget year. Moreover, it may be challenging for the government to push through material revenue reform given general elections that need to be held by mid-2024, as well as various state elections before then. India’s fiscal strength is therefore unlikely to increase and will remain a key credit challenge compared with peers. Public spending to remain high for highways and railways; sovereign green bonds to mobilize funding for public projects to reduce carbon intensity. The government’s announcement that it will keep public infrastructure spending at an elevated level is credit positive for companies in this sector.In fiscal 2021, the government spent 11% more than budget estimates on highways and 9% more on railways. The increase in public investment helps to address infrastructure constraints and support future private investment. The total capital expenditure outlay by the government for fiscal 2022 is up by 24.5%, from a high base, from revised estimates for fiscal 2021 (see Exhibit 5), and is 35% more than the fiscal 2021 budget estimates.",Special Correspondent,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-growth-oriented-but-poses-fiscal-challenges-says-moodys/article38375299.ece
665,"February 04, 2022",10:27 IST,business,budget,The need to boost labour income and consumption expenditure," The story so far:  The Union Budget for 2022-23 has projected a fiscal deficit of 6.4% of nominal GDP, a narrowing from the 6.9% assumed in the revised estimates for the current fiscal year ending on March 31.
 Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the move was “consistent with the broad path of fiscal consolidation announced” by her last year in order to reach a fiscal deficit level below 4.5% by 2025-26. “While setting the fiscal deficit level in 2022-23, I am conscious of the need to nurture growth, through public investment, to become stronger and sustainable,” she added. Though every economic crisis involves sharp reduction in output growth rate, the specificity of the present crisis in India lies in the sharper reduction in labour income as compared to profits. The consequent reduction in income share of labour was associated with a sharp fall in consumption-GDP ratio as well as absolute value of consumption expenditure during the pandemic. While the GDP in 2021-22 is estimated to attain the pre-pandemic level, real consumption expenditure remains to be lower as compared to 2019-20. The squeeze in labour income and consumption expenditure witnessed during the pandemic was itself preceded by what turned out to be the longest episode of growth slowdown in the Indian economy since the liberalisation period. The budget 2022 was placed in the midst of these distinct challenges. The first challenge is specific to the pandemic and pertained to the need of undertaking policies that boosts labour income and consumption expenditure. The second challenge pertained to addressing the structural constraints of the Indian economy that restricted growth even during the pre-pandemic period. Continuing with the objective of fiscal consolidation, the Budget falls short of addressing both these challenges. There are three distinct features of this fiscal consolidation process. Firstly, while share of revenue and non-debt receipts in GDP has remained more or less unchanged, the objective of fiscal consolidation has been sought to be achieved primarily by reducing the expenditure-GDP ratio (see figure 1). The brunt of this expenditure compression fell on revenue expenditure. Continuing with the fiscal strategy adopted in the last two years since the pandemic, the allocation of capital expenditure as a share of GDP has been marginally increased in 2022-23 as compared to 2021-22. Though additional capital expenditure could be financed either by postponing fiscal consolidation process or by increasing revenue, however, the budget has sought to achieve fiscal consolidation by reducing the allocation for revenue expenditure-GDP ratio. Secondly, since the bulk of the revenue expenditure comprises of food subsidies and current expenses in social and economic services, reduction in the allocation for revenue expenditure has been associated with fall in several key expenditure that affect the income and livelihood of labour (see figure 2). For example, allocation for both agriculture and allied activities and rural development registered a sharp decline in nominal absolute terms in 2022-23 as compared to 2021-22. Similarly, in the midst of the ongoing pandemic, total nominal expenditure on medical and public health registered a sharp fall in 2022-23 as compared to 2021-22. Such expenditure compression has been associated with the overall fall in the allocation for total social sector expenditure. Thirdly, despite sharp increase in profits during the pandemic, the corporate tax-GDP ratio has continued to remain below the 2018-19 level due to tax concessions. The last decade registered a sharp rise in the share of corporate tax concessions in GDP, which reached its peak at 3.9% by 2020-21 (see figure 3). Reflecting the trend in tax concessions, corporate tax-GDP ratio registered a decline particularly since 2018-19 when corporate tax-ratio declined sharply from 3.5% to 2.7%. Despite the objective of fiscal consolidation, the corporate tax ratio continues to remain low and restrict revenue receipts. 
 
 The objective of fiscal consolidation along with the inability to increase revenue receipts has posed a constraint on development expenditure. With non-development expenditure comprising of interest payments, administrative expenditure and various other components which are typically rigid downward, the brunt of expenditure compression has fallen on development expenditure. Figure 4 shows the trend in share of centre’s development expenditure in GDP since 2008-09. While the decade of 2010s was characterised by different governments meeting fiscal targets by adjusting their expenditure, it registered a sharp decline in the development expenditure ratio till the advent of the pandemic in 2019-20. Albeit to a limited extent, the fiscal stimulus implemented in the first year of the pandemic brought about a brief recovery in 2020-21. The fiscal consolidation strategy carried out in the last years has once again led the development expenditure ratio to slide downward. The reduction in the allocation for development expenditure ratio for 2022-23 reflects reduction in the allocation for food subsidies, national rural employment guarantee program, expenditure in agriculture, rural development and social sector. The Budget estimates of different expenditure are sensitive to the growth estimates for 2022-23. If the GDP growth rate and revenue growth rate happens to be lower than what is projected, then the actual expenditure can turn out to be even lower than what is projected. Given the fact that the actual GDP growth rate in at least the last four years have been consistently lower than what was initially projected by the Economics Survey, the possibility of actual expenditure falling short of budget numbers cannot be assumed away. But even if the actual expenditure is close to the budget estimates, the recovery of labour income and consumption expenditure would be largely restricted by the manner in which fiscal consolidation has been carried out. This is because reduction in the allocation for development expenditure would have adverse impact on labour income and consumption expenditure. The positive impact of higher capital expenditure on the recovery process would be largely curtailed by the adverse impact of more than proportionate fall in revenue expenditure. Given the fiscal consolidation strategy of the Government, the prospect and extent of economic revival at the present remains heavily dependent on external demand. Despite the brief recovery in exports in the last few quarters, the possibility of sustained economic recovery relying exclusively on the export channel appears to be bleak at the present as different countries have already started pursuing fiscal consolidation at the dictate of the IMF. What the Indian economy lacks at the moment is an effective policy instrument that can boost labour income and aggregate demand.

In comparison to previous periods, the impact on rates is not at all significant. Why? Because emerging markets have worked to build buffers and strength for situations like this and because many of them themselves have taken prudent actions once they faced inflationary pressures,” she said. “We are very positive on the fact that India is thinking of addressing short-term issues, but also long-term structural transformation, and that there is a great deal of emphasis placed on innovation on research and development on human capital investment and digitalisation, as well as thinking of how India can accelerate the climate change agenda using economic instruments for that,” Ms. Georgieva said. “So, all in all, I read the [budget] statement and I thought it was a very thoughtful policy agenda for India,” the senior official said in response to a question.", PTI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2022-23-thoughtful-policy-agenda-for-india-says-imf-managing-director/article38374858.ece

While a review of the 1% TDS (tax deducted at source) rate for all virtual assets’ trades could perhaps be considered, top Finance Ministry officials also pointed out that even investments in equity and debt instruments on stock exchanges which create value for the economy, involve a Securities Transaction Tax levy.  Reacting to industry fears about the tax rates, Revenue Secretary Tarun Bajaj strongly
 backed the 30% rate and said there was no reason to tax these assets lower than what anyone else pays on their income.
  “The ultra-rich pay 42% taxes including surcharges,” Mr. Bajaj told
The Hindu . “It’s not as if some economic value is created or the country’s GDP is growing (from crypto trading). If you are speculating and don’t find it feasible, stop doing it,” he said, adding that the government didn’t need to encourage such trading even though it may take a fresh look at the 1% TDS rate.
 “We are looking at minor nitty-gritties,” Mr. Bajaj said, noting that the TDS levy is necessitated by the tax authorities’ realisation that collecting information about trades will be a challenge.  “This is why we are also saying no set-offs will be allowed, otherwise someone can make capital gains on equity and show losses here in your personal wallet to wallet transactions,” he noted. “TDS will be cut and if an exchange doesn’t get that done, the provisions will apply to them. So now the responsibility and accountability comes on to them.”  “If there are any reservations on which we agree, that the legislation needs to be straightened out, then of course, we will work that out,” said Central Board of Direct Tax chairperson J.B. Mohapatra. “But the fact remains that the digital virtual asset tax has been brought in to help the larger ecosystem also to remain unaffected by the supposed opacity of that segment,” he underlined.  “You should not take any message about regulatory regime from this tax. Till the regulatory regime is in place, from the tax point of view, we are not concerned if you can do derivatives or intraday trading on this,” the Revenue Secretary said.

Union Budget 2023 is ₹92,736.5 crore, against an allocation of ₹85,712.56 crore in the last Budget. Though this is an increase of 8.19% in absolute terms, it’s not proportionate to the increase in the total expenditure in the Union Budget. The share of the Budget for children is a meagre 2.35% of the Union Budget for the next fiscal, which is a reduction of 0.11 percentage points from this fiscal, says HAQ. This is the lowest share children have received in the last 11 years.
 The allocation for child health has decreased by 6.08%. It has dropped from ₹3,727.57 crore in 2021-2022 to ₹3,501.11 crore for the next fiscal.

The share of child education in the overall Union Budget 2022-23 has witnessed only a marginal increase of 0.3 percentage points from 1.74% in the current fiscal to 1.73% for the next fiscal.

Schemes for the protection and welfare of children clubbed under the Mission Vatsalaya of the Ministry of Women and Children received ₹1,472.17 crore.

The schemes under the Ministry that focus on safety of women such as Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao, One Stop Centres, Nari Adalat, Mahila Police Volunteer and Women’s Helpline saw a decline in allocation from ₹587 crore to ₹562 crore.
  The budget for the Ministry of Women and Child Development as a portion of the total expenditure
has also declined from 0.70% to 0.63% . The Ministry received an allocation of ₹25,172.28 crore- which is a 3% increase from last year’s budgetary estimate of ₹24,435 crore.

 The gender Budget, which includes schemes for women across various Ministries, has further shrunk this year, with its share in the total expenditure declining from 4.4% to 4.3% for financial year 2023 at ₹1,71,006.47 crore. It has decreased from 0.71% of GDP of the revised estimates for 2021-22 to 0.66% of the GDP in the budgetary estimates of 2022-2023. Ms. Sitharaman’s Budget speech had nothing new to offer for women with no new schemes or initiatives announced. Word women appeared only six times in her speech. ""Around 91% of the increase in total Gender Budget from last year is from schemes in Part B [which are only 30% specific to women]. There's a very insignificant increase in the Part A total, which has the schemes we know for sure are just for women, at least most of them,"" Shruti Ambast, Senior Policy Analyst, Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability, said. “Women are a large number of the beneficiaries in the schemes that include MGNREGS, National Social Assistance Programme and schemes for welfare of SC, ST, minorities and other vulnerable sections. The combined expenditure on these schemes has reduced from 3.2 per cent of the total revised expenditure of 2021-22 to 2.5 per cent in budget allocation in 2022-2023. This shows that the government’s vision of ‘Amrit Kaal’ has no place for women,” the All India Democratic Women’s Association said in a press statement. Other demands of the women’s movement such as a financial commitment for setting up anti-sexual harassment committees for working women of the informal sector, creches, working-women’s hostels in all cities, special old-age pension scheme for women have been swept under the carpet, Maya John, Convenor, Centre for Struggling Women, said.",Jagriti Chandra,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/anganwadi-workers-call-for-stir-in-response-to-budget/article38365216.ece
671,"February 02, 2022",19:57 IST,business,budget,Union Budget 2022: What does the budget offer the common man? | In Focus podcast," With elections coming up in five states, it was expected that the Union Budget for the financial year 2022-23 would focus on addressing the crisis of unemployment. One of the things that Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman needed to do in this regard was to increase government spending, and she appears to have done so, increasing the capital expenditure outlay by 35.4%, But will this be enough to draw in adequate amounts of private investment and ensure job creation on a massive scale? Also, how do we understand the logic behind the cuts in subsidies, with fertilizer, food and petroleum subsidies all witnessing a marked decline? While job creation remains a primary concern, the allocation for MGNREGA – which saw a surge in demand during the pandemic – has not been increased. How do we assess the Budget on the welfare front – in the domains of health, education and farmer welfare? In this podcast, we look to unpack the numbers of the Union Budget and get to the core of what it means for the common man. Guest:  Arun Kumar, economist and  Malcolm S.

presentation of the Union Budget , Prime Minister Narendra Modi told partymen that it was focussed on providing basic amenities for the poor, the middle class and the youth. At a function organised by the BJP called “Aatmanirbhar Arthvyavastha”, Prime Minister Modi said his government was working on the saturation of basic services for all, especially the poor.
 “After the second World War, there was a change in the world order and post COVID too we will be seeing a reordering of the world order. People, globally, want to see an empowered and strong India. It is imperative for us that we take our country forward at a rapid pace and strengthen it across several sectors,” he said. “It is very important that India not only becomes self-reliant but also that a modern India is built on the foundation of ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’.” Leaving aside the political angle, the Budget has been welcomed by all quarters, he noted.Prime Minister Modi also said migration from border villages was not good for national security and the Budget has provisions to develop “vibrant villages” there. The vibrant village programme will benefit border villages in Uttarakhand, Arunachal Pradesh and Ladakh, he said. Also ReadWatch | Highlights of Union Budget 2022-23
 
 He said very soon every village will have optical fibre connectivity and 5G technology will usher in a new era. On the announcement for launching the digital rupee, Prime Minister Modi said it would open up new opportunities for the Fintech sector. Mr. Modi pointed out that the Budget proposes to make a four-fold increase in public investments from the UPA years. Talking about the agri sector, he said a of lot things were said about the minimum support price (MSP) but farmers are expected to get more than ₹1.5 lakh crore as MSP for paddy this season. He said the houses provided under the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana scheme have in a way turned the poor intolakhpatis . “In the last seven years, we have given three crore poor people ‘pucca’ houses, and made them ‘lakhpatis’. Those who lived in slums, have their own houses. Our government has increased the price and size of these houses so that there is space for education for children. Out of this, most of the houses are in the name of women. We have also made women ‘maalkins’ [owners],”he said.",The Hindu Bureau,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/budget-2022-focussed-on-providing-basic-amenities-to-poor-middle-class-youth-pm-modi/article38363413.ece
673,"February 03, 2022",12:22 IST,business,budget,Union Budget 2022 | Industry welcomes provisions," The Union Budget 2022-23 has been viewed positively by the business and economy sector. This is what top business executives said.
  N. Chandrasekaran, Chairman, Tata Sons, said: “The Budget presented by FM Nirmala Sitharaman builds on the excellent Budget last year, continuing the trend towards more productive expenditure. The Budget is consistent with our
PM Narendra Modi’s vision of making India Atmanirbhar: a digital superpower, a sustainability leader and a healthy nation. This statement of intent is clearly supported by a plan for the future, and backed by allocations — specifically in the areas of infrastructure, digital transition, planet resilience, education and health — to support Indian ambitions.
 “Continuing down this path, it isn’t hard to imagine India becoming a digitally-forward, sustainable global superpower by the end of this decade,” he said. Dinesh Khara, chairman, State Bank of India, said, “The Budget continues to strike a balance between the challenges posed by the recurring COVID-19 waves and the need to contain the economic damage due to pandemic. On the banking and finance side the announcements are significant.” “The Budget proposes to set up 75 Digital Banking Units (DBUs) in 75 districts of the country by Scheduled Commercial Banks. This proposal is in sync with our ongoing digital banking initiatives. The most significant announcement of the Budget are higher allocation to capital expenditure and extension of ECLGS [Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme] — particularly the specific support to hospitality and related sectors,” he said. Anish Shah, MD & CEO, M&M, said “The Budget builds a strong foundation for the future with a focus on infrastructure, sustainability and inclusive growth while maintaining fiscal prudence. It supports underlying economic recovery through active policymaking. The Budget reinforces India’s commitment to addressing climate change with various initiatives around clean mobility. it is inclusive in its approach by addressing the rural sector, MSMEs and various economically vulnerable sections of society.” “It will also drive a wave of technology in the agriculture and farming sector with technology usage such as kisan drones for crop assessments, land records and spraying of insecticides to name a few. While it does not provide short-term stimulus [likely due to inflation concerns], it addresses a more important need to create long-term sustainable growth,” he said. R. Mukundan, MD and CEO, Tata Chemicals, said “This is a growth and infrastructure-focused Budget and the Union government has made its intention clear by pushing up capital expenditure to boost robust growth. At the same time, the government has maintained continuity in terms of the policy framework and continued the process of simplification and standardisation, including in the area of taxation. “These will reduce litigation that will boost domestic manufacturing, exports, and investments. There is a further major thrust in areas like sustainability and green technologies, digital technologies, urbanisation, and logistics,” he added. Anil G. Verma, Executive Director and President, Godrej & Boyce, said, “The Budget for FY 2023 holds a lot of promise for the economy. It has a thrust for the social sector with investments in primary and vocational education, provision for drinking water to reach more households and the extension of the PM Awas Yojana to provide housing. In addition, its outlay for procurement of agricultural produce will reward the farmers for their effort and put money in their hands which will help to propel consumption demand.” “Reforms in customs administration will no doubt support both the SEZs as well as other manufacturers in the domestic tariff area. Our SEZs are vulnerable to both disruptions in the global supply chain and also the emphasis on domestic sourcing that we increasingly see overseas,” he said. G. K. Das, Chief Manager Finance, Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust, said: “The SEZ Act will be replaced with a new legislation that would enable States to become partners in becoming development hubs. The decision of the government to relax SEZ norms will reduce the current compliance burden. It will cover the existing industrial enclaves and enhance the competitiveness of exports, move aimed for the development of enterprise and hubs,” he said. “While the Department of Commerce has been looking to make changes in the SEZ norms for some time now, it had recently received an in-principle approval from the Finance Ministry. The Custom Administration will be fully IT driven and functioning on the Customs National Portal with a focus on higher facilitation and with only risk-based checks. This will ease doing business by SEZ units considerably. This reform shall be implemented by 30 September 2022.” Martin Schwenk, MD& CEO, Mercedes-Benz India, said, “This Budget is overall growth- oriented with a clear focus on digitisation, electrification, infrastructure development and ease of doing business; aiming to propel a long-term growth of the Indian economy. The battery-swapping announcement is in the right direction and will be helpful to a limited segment.” “We however need a broader holistic view on the strategy around developing electric mobility for the passenger vehicle segment. A mid-to-long term planning for demand creation is needed and we hope the fine prints will have ripple effect and passively stimulate growth for the auto industry,” he added. Rajesh Gopinathan, CEO, Tata Consultancy Services, said, “The Union Budget has magnified the digital India vision and importance of technology in all focus areas like infrastructure, inclusive development, sustainability, sunrise industries, and skilling. This Budget provides many opportunities for growth for the technology industry by bringing world class solutions and best practices for railways, healthcare, education, financial services, and regulatory bodies to accelerate India’s growth.” “The decision to introduce e-passport will further streamline the overall citizen experience, enhance security, and facilitate smoother international travel. The initiative to introduce a Digital Rupee in the form of a Central Bank issued Digital Currency (CBDC) is an extremely futuristic decision. It creates an opportunity for India to leapfrog in the digital currency world and be a global leader in providing a digital currency option to its citizens.” Arvind Subramanian, MD & CEO, Mahindra Lifespace Developers Ltd., said, “With its focus on affordable housing, infrastructure projects, inclusive development and productivity enhancement, Union Budget 2022 is both balanced and growth-oriented. The allocation of ₹48,000 crore under PMAY urban and rural schemes and of ₹60,000 crore to cover 3.8 crore households for tap water will boost affordable housing in India.” “However, an extension on tax exemptions to first-time buyers of affordable homes would have helped further incentivise purchase decisions and accelerate growth in the segment. Connectivity is a key growth driver of real estate, and the industry is expected to benefit from the renewed focus on road construction,” he said. Baba N. Kalyani, CMD Bharat Forge Ltd., said, ”The proposed New legislation for SEZs with States as partners coupled with heightened emphasis on the seven engines under PM Gati Shakti initiative should pave way for a new India that is recognised for its speed, productivity and scale; thus, boosting the country’s overall investment attractiveness and export competitiveness.” “Aligned with Prime Minister’s Aatmanirbhar Bharat agenda, the government’s commitment to promote self-reliance and indigenisation by leveraging Indian industry is once again reinforced with the 68% (enhanced) domestic allocation for defence capital procurement. Earmarking 25% of Defence R&D budget for Industry, Start-ups & Academia is a forward looking measure that will pave way for investments in frontier technologies and capability development. Industry in partnership with DRDO through SPV mode for development of critical weapon systems and military platforms is a path-breaking reform that will significantly transform the Indian defence eco-system and lead India to being a net-exporter of defence equipment/platforms,” he said. Alain SPOHR, Managing Director, Alstom India & South Asia, said, “With an enhanced capital expenditure outlay of 35% as compared to last year, core infrastructure segments including Railways and Urban Transport stand to benefit and will have a huge multiplier effect on the economy.” “Highlight of the Budget was the announcement to introduce 400 new Vande Bharat trains over the next three years, introduction of the state-of-the-art KAVACH TCAS signalling systems over 2,000 km of railway network, larger investments to provide for sustainable and integrated urban transport systems. The total budget estimates of ₹23,875 crore for MRTS & Metro Projects will incentivise faster implementation of projects and the standardisation of metro design systems will provide the much-needed stability for manufacturers,” he said. Gautam Hari Singhania, CMD, Raymond Ltd., said, “The Union Budget clearly focuses on stepping up capital expenditure while keeping at bay the fiscal deficit and inflationary concerns. The continued capex infusion pegged at ₹ 7.50 lakh crore in 2022-23, sharply stepped up by 35.4C% should be clearly seen both as demand and supply enhancing response as it creates infrastructure capacity for future growth. This Budget underlines the continuity of supply-side reforms including deregulation, simplification of processes, and production-linked incentives among other aspects – leading to overall improved ease of doing business.” “A stable tax and policy structure, strong support to manufacturing sector and MSMEs is a right step towards Atmanirbhar Bharat. The intent of this government is growth and job creation across sectors, with an impetus on infrastructure development however the success lies in the execution for a sustainable economic momentum and growth,” he said. Sanjiv Puri, Chairman, ITC, said, “The path-breaking measures address key issues of livelihood generation, enhancing farmer incomes and building climate resilience. The substantive enhancement of public expenditure will create a multiplier impact on growth and competitiveness. The multi-dimensional interventions to usher in Next Generation Agriculture through digitalisation, R&D, leveraging strengths of Agri-techs and FPOs, will transform the agri sector.” Ashwin Mittal, CMD and CEO, Course5 Intelligence Ltd., said, “Analytics is the key to successful implementation of the multi-modal PM GatiShakti master plan with its seven-engine focus for economic transformation and inclusive development for India@100. FM highlighted that Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a sunrise opportunity while advocating promoting digital economy & fintech, technology enabled development; and we, at Course5 Intelligence, reiterate the importance of AI-led analytics and insights.” “The role of analytics is more pronounced post global pandemic accelerating digital adoption by companies globally as they seek to digitize their core business model to remain economically viable,” he said. Sanjay Dutt, MD & CEO, Tata Realty and Infrastructure Ltd .,said, “Consistency, Continuity & Stability’ are the leading mantras of the 2022-23 Budget. The Budget is well-balanced, growth and capital expenditure oriented and is aimed at increasing people’s opportunities. However, the success of any Budget lies in its execution. We welcome the honorable Finance Minister’s focus and impetus on job creation and urban development, it will spur the growth of the Indian economy.” “The Special Economic Zones Act will be replaced with new legislation that will enable the States to become partners in ‘Development of Enterprise and Service Hubs’. The industry expects the new policy to ensure domestic companies be able to utilise the SEZ infrastructure, and the policy shall enable unit by unit de notification,” he said. Yogesh Mudras, Managing Director, Informa Markets in India, said, “This year, the Union Budget has been one of recovery and stabilisation from the impact of COVID-19. The Budget has taken some initiatives for MSMEs and India Inc for start-ups. The extension of ECLGS scheme is a welcome move for MSMEs. The tax concession period has been extended by one more year, which in my opinion is a very positive move. A tax rate of 15% has been decided for the newly incorporated manufacturing unit which will further boost manufacturing activities.” “Healthcare and infrastructure were the main highlights of Budget 2022 and immense investment has been allocated for the expansion of roadways and logistics networks. Introduction of ‘Digital Rupee’ using blockchain technology sends a strong message that India is at the forefront of technology implementation. A digital currency issuance by the RBI will result in a structured approach with controlled regulation and bring in transparency to transactions enabling accounting of all money,” he said. Ambarish Parekh, Chief Experience Officer, Paycraft, said, “Considering the challenges faced by the Indian economy in this pandemic, the Ministry of Finance has put up a fine balancing act. The Union Budget 2022 has various encouraging initiatives that will propel aspiring entrepreneurs and boost small businesses.” “The Budget showcases a strong intent to continue driving a less-cash ecosystem considering the rapid growth in the Digital Payment sector, The government has introduced 75 digital banks across 75 districts to promote economical and user friendly payment gateways,” he said. Ambareesh Murty, Co-Founder & CEO of Pepperfry, said, “It is heartening to see the government looking at economic growth not just for the next year, but the next 25 years. Budget ’22 has provided a significant outlay to infrastructure investments which will benefit supply chains. Businesses will be able to deliver products to consumers faster, seamlessly, and at better prices. At a time when work from home has become mainstream, this will enable consumers to furnish their homes to their taste and evolving requirements without burning a hole in their pockets.” Rajesh Jejurikar, Executive Director, Auto & Farm Sectors, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd., said, “The roadmap laid out to usher in sustainable mobility by Finance Minister in the Union Budget 2022-23 will bolster the electric mobility adoption in India. Battery swapping can offer a practical alternative to increase adoption of electric vehicles.” “As part of our Last Mile Mobility, we look forward to working with the government, policymakers and our partners to formulate and implement the battery swapping policy. This will include introducing interoperability standards as well as driving innovation in battery as a service business models,” he said. Rajiv Agarwal, Operating Partner (Infrastructure) Essar and Managing Director, Essar Ports Ltd., said, “The Budget, guided by the PM’s Gati Shakti master plan, will facilitate economic recovery, especially amidst the persistent pandemic. Public investment to modernise overall infrastructure in the nation is expected to enable efficient logistics and boost manufacturing.” With plans to develop 100 PM Gati Shakti cargo terminals in the next three years, the government has formulated an exceptional vision to boost EXIM competitiveness, which will help accelerate the economy and create more jobs and opportunities for the youth.” Sunil Gupta, MD and CEO, Avis India, said, “In today’s Union Budget for FY2023, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has given a special push to electric vehicles, increasing EV battery production and development will give the private sector special benefits. The EV ecosystem will benefit from a battery-swapping strategy that will be implemented alongside interoperability standards.” Raghunath K, Country Representative, thyssenkrupp India, said, “The Union Budget reiterates the emphasis on public investment to modernize infrastructure over the medium term. While balanced, the budget is favourable towards the manufacturing industry and MSMEs, given their vital role in strengthening the Indian economy. It expands the scope and idea of the Atmanirbhar Bharat and the newly announced PLI schemes will give a fillip to India’s future growth story. The aim has been to veer towards new directions across multiple sectors like automobile, heavy engineering, and areas related to farm produce. This structural approach gives the right impetus and ensures a positive environment for a quick recovery in the aftermath of multiple waves of COVID. It will re-start the engine of growth and job creation. This budget is a practical and sustainable approach for the growth trajectory that India needs in the long term.” Prashant Ruia, Director, Essar Capital, said, “A bold one with a massive hike in public investment will be the booster dose to restart corporate investments. The infrastructure allocation with a focus on technology will generate employment & help transform tomorrow!” Ronojoy Dutta, Whole Time Director and Chief Executive Officer, IndiGo, said, “Budget 2023 appears to be growth-oriented by increase in capital outlay of ₹7.5 lakh crore fiscal deficit caped at 6.4% and efforts are being made to reduce compliance burdens and improve ease of doing business. We expect the Budget would enable India to achieve growth estimate of 9.2%. We welcome the new incentives of issuing of e-passport and introduction of digital currency.” “The government’s relentless focus on national transportation infrastructure development with the PM Gati Shakti plan will strengthen the much-needed multimodal connectivity and facilitate seamless movement of cargo, while reducing logistics costs. Having said that we were expecting tax concession to aviation industry in the forms of cut in ATF excise duty and allocation of concessional finance to airlines to help us come out of the pandemic,” he said. Sumant Sinha, Chairman and CEO, ReNew Power, said, “This Budget has rightly focused on infrastructure, which is critical to drive growth in both the short and longer term. The Finance Minister deserves kudos for laying the groundwork for continuing the economy’s robust recovery from the pandemic effect and that, too, with a climate-friendly focus. The push towards infrastructure creation, digitisation, clean energy, financial access, and inclusive development were big highlights of a growth-focused Budget. The far-sighted move to rationalise import duties for specific sectors such as capital goods, supported by PLI for critical sectors, will help Make In India in the long term, creating many more jobs.” Ashish Pethe, All India Gem & Jewellery Domestic Council (GJC), said, “The Union Budget 2022-23 is a well-balanced Budget, as the government is focusing on development. Though we were expecting some action on Bullion exchanges and a reduction in Gold Import Duty and GST. However, this Budget has the potential to uplift the spending power of the rural India by giving them impetus through govt. spending. This will ultimately increase the rural income and help the G&J sector, since 60% of the gold demand comes from rural India.” “We are happy with the reduction in Import duties of cut & polished diamonds, sawn goods, pearls, colour stones. Easing out procedures of ecommerce will also support small businesses and improve exports, as now even the small jeweller will be able to take benefit of the online portals for business. ECGLS scheme extension till March 2023 is a big sigh of relief and an increased outlay by ₹50,000 crores will help most of the small & medium jewellers as majority of the industry falls under MSME,” he said. Maithili Tambe, CEO, The Academy School, Maharashtra, said “Two important points on education are worth highlighting. First is the digital infrastructure: due to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, the whole education system had to shift online. Teaching every child was the biggest challenge any school could face. Through One Class, One Channel, it will become much easier to reach every child.” “Second is the upgradation of anganwadis: they are usually taken as day care centres, but it is a base for any education system. Equal importance should be given to early childhood education as well. That said, the implementation of these measures should be effective and time-bound,” she said. Dipali Goenka, Jt MD & CEO, Welspun India Ltd said, “The 2022-23 Budget is futuristic and highly investment focused. It reiterates the government’s resolve to fuel further recovery and growth of the post pandemic India by increasing capital expenditure across sectors like infrastructure, health, education, housing, water and transport. The underlying thrust on digtisation and technology, including the setting up of digital currency, would definitely provide the required push towards a more digital economy.” “Announcement of the PLI incentives for solar capacity building will encourage and aid corporates and the country to undergo clean energy transition and take positive climate action. In addition, the PM Gati Shakti master plan based on seven engines of growth would propel the economy from bottoms up by way of inclusive development and productivity enhancement, through strategic agriculture sector and MSME investments,” she said. Sunil Mathur, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Siemens Ltd., said, “We welcome the growth-oriented Budget with a focus on the four pillars – productivity, climate action, financing investments, and PM Gati Shakti plan. These are concrete steps in the right direction, and overtime should positively impact the economy. The increased Capex outlay of ₹ 7.50 lakh crore further demonstrates the intent of the government to create the necessary impetus for the economy. Stability in tax policy is also a welcome step”. Ramesh Kancharla, Chairman and Managing Director, Rainbow Children’s Hospital, said, “We are happy with the announcement of the Digital Health Eco System which will go a long way in providing a national registry of the healthcare infrastructure of the country. This will improve transparency and information flow of key healthcare parameters across the country. Given the challenges in mental health thrown up by the pandemic, the National Tele-Mental Health Programme is another welcome step.” “India has managed the pandemic phenomenally. The size of the country and the demographic distribution are unique challenges that have been managed through one of the largest vaccination programmes in the world. Also the effective use of technology through the Cowin and Arogya Setu App have helped in identifying, tracing and managing COVID cases,” he said. Sanjay Sethi, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, Chalet Hotels Ltd., said, “We welcome the attention given to the hospitality industry by the Hon’ Finance Minister in the ECLGS announcement. However, we await fine print on the relaxations on meeting debt ratio covenants of previous ECLGS schemes, if any, and if the ₹200 crores cap under the scheme has been enhanced.” “We are also very pleased to hear the Hon’ Finance Minister focus on the environment, sustainability, solar power and electric vehicles. The focus given to prioritise clean mobility and green energy in the current Budget, is aligned with the initiatives and actions undertaken at Chalet Hotels Ltd.,” he said.",Special Correspondent,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/union-budget-2022-industry-welcomes-provisions/article38363227.ece
674,"February 02, 2022",08:40 IST,business,budget,"Morning Digest | Union Budget 2022 bets on public capital spending to boost job creation; 6 dead and several feared trapped in abandoned coal mines in Jharkhand, and more"," Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday said the government will auction telecom spectrum in 2022, which will facilitate private players to roll out 5G services before March 2023. Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, presenting her fourth Budget and the second one in a pandemic-hit economy on Tuesday, largely stuck to the broad script from last year, scaling up the wager on public capital spending to revive private investments and job creation through a virtuous growth cycle, while keeping an eye on the country’s macro fiscal health. Union Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, delivered her fourth Budget in the Parliament on February 1. Here are sector-wise highlights of the 2022 Union Budget presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s Budget speech was “the most capitalist speech ever read by a Finance Minister” and did “nothing” to deal with challenges like unemployment, loss of household incomes, per capita expenditure and inflation, said former Finance Minister P. Chidambaran on Tuesday. In a further push for Make in India in defence,the Union government on Tuesday announced additional measures to boost domestic manufacturing and reduce imports. The total allocation for defence in the Budget has gone up marginally to ₹5.25 lakh crore.This isup by 4.43% higher than the revised estimates of last year and 9.8% higher over the Budget estimates of last year. The Centre’s ₹73,000 crore allocation for the flagship rural jobs scheme, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), in 2022-23 is 25% lower than the ₹98,000 crore revised estimate for the scheme in the current year, reverting to the same insufficient amount allocated in the last budget. In fact the MGNREGA did not find any mention during the Union Finance Minister’s Budget speech on Tuesday. The Budget has allocated funds for projects related to Afghanistan. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) will have ₹200 crore to spend on that country. It will also dedicate ₹600 crore for Myanmar, which is currently reeling under civil war since the military coup of February 2021. Bhutan, as usual, has received the biggest allocation with ₹2266.24 crore. The Centre has walked a fine line in the Supreme Court on the Pegasus issue. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, in a six-page affidavit in August last year, makes do with a sweeping denial on the snooping allegations. But the lone affidavit in the case does not address the basic issue whether India had bought Pegasus in the first place. Industry reactions to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's Union Budget 2022 presented in the Lok Sabha on February 1. As Budget speeches go, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's address on Tuesday had almost no reference to any poll-bound States and appeared to be a broad strokes oration on the government's economic interventions without populist announcements. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented a balanced and growth oriented budget with a strong emphasis on long term growth and avoided any announcement of election-related populist measures, says Renu Sud Karnad, Managing Director, HDFC Limited. Agriculture and allied activities, which still employ the largest bulk of the population, saw a marginal 2% increase in Budget allocations for 2022-23. The sector’s share in the overall Budget allocations fell from 4.26% in 2021-22 to 3.84%. India’s abstention from the Security Council vote on Ukraine is widely read as a play to balance ties with Moscow and Washington and engaging “both sides of the fence”, rather than of being a “fence-sitter”. In a major push to develop and improve connectivity in border areas, villages along the northern border will see development under the new Vibrant Villages Programme, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced on Tuesday. At least six persons died have died since Monday while several others are feared trapped inside three abandoned coal mines in Dhanbad, Jharkhand. Rescue operations are under way. One of the U.S.’s most prestigious law schools, the Georgetown University Law Center in Washington DC, has put an incoming faculty member, Ilya Shapiro, on administrative leave, while his Twitter comments are investigated. Amnesty International on Tuesday labelled Israel an “apartheid” state that treats Palestinians as “an inferior racial group,” joining the assessment of other rights groups which the Jewish state vehemently rejects. In a sense, Putin is seeking to rewrite history, with an attempt to push NATO back and restore Russian stature. He considers the break-up of the USSR the biggest tragedy of the 20th century and has called the eastward expansion of NATO that added 14 new Baltic and Central and East European member states (in stages) an existential threat. Top Indian players, including senior opener Shikhar Dhawan and Shreyas Iyer, along with overseas stars such as Pat Cummins and Kagiso Rabada have been bracketed in the ₹2 crore highest base price category for the upcoming IPL auction. Country's tremendous success at the Tokyo Olympics seems to have influenced the sports budget as the Central Government on Tuesday allocated ₹3062.60 crore for financial year 2022-23 — an increase of ₹305.58 crore, compared to the last year's amount.",The Hindu Bureau,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/morning-digest-february-2-2022/article38361223.ece

Out of ₹35,581 crores for J&K, ₹33,923 crores have been allocated to meet the revenue deficit and resource gap.

The Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) said in a statement that the Budget had “little substance” and reflected “insensitivity” towards the problems faced by workers during the pandemic.  “The Budget is presented in the overall background of desperate and destructive privatisation drive embracing the infrastructure, manufacturing and mineral sectors in entirety, facilitating transfer of resources from the national kitty to private hands, both domestic and foreign,” the CITU statement read.  It added that the union would go ahead with the general strike on March 28 and 29.  The All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) said the Budget was “another bonanza for corporates”, while common citizens were left to fend for themselves. “The whole exercise appeared to be a farce as it was claimed to be budget vision for 100 years of Independence. In 2015 also, the Budget presentation was claimed to be for 25 years. The Finance Minister failed to give account of what happened to all the tall claims and targets set up for employment, smart cities, Skill India, double income of farmers, relief to poor and middle income groups, improvement in health infrastructure etc.,” the AITUC said in a statement. The RSS-affiliated Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh welcomed some aspects of the Budget, including the focus on infrastructure development through ‘PM Gati Shakti’, but pointed out that a “major disappointment” was the status quo in pension under EPS 95. “Revised fiscal deficit of 6.9% is a matter of concern.

677,"February 02, 2022",05:42 IST,business,budget,Union Budget 2022 | Devendra Fadnavis hails MSP allocation; farmer leaders call it ‘disappointing’," While former Maharashtra Chief Minister and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis praised the Union Budget as ‘inclusive’ and one that aimed to make India ‘self-reliant’, farmer leaders in the State trashed it as being “extremely disappointing” for farmers.   Speaking to reporters in poll-bound Goa, Mr. Fadanavis – who is the BJP’s Goa election in-charge - said the Budget, presented by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, aimed to make India
atmanirbhar (self-reliant) and
balashali (strong) and was designed to take the country towards progress.
 “The budget has touched all sectors. What is most important is that even after the country has suffered the ravages of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Budget has projected a 9.2% growth,” said the BJP leader. Stressing the Budget’s benefits for farmers and the agriculture sector, Mr. Fadnavis said that Ms. Sitharaman’s announcement of earmarking Rs. 2.37 lakh crore as direct payments for minimum support price (MSP) to wheat and paddy farmers for the fiscal year 2022-23 was the biggest allocation in the farming sector the country had seen so far. The announcement is viewed as a consequence of the months-long farmers’ agitation demanding a guaranteed MSP for farm produce. The agitation ended with the government finally repealing its three contentious agriculture reform laws of 2020 in November last year. “The budget has also given a special thrust on agricultural start-ups, which will eliminate middlemen and commission agents between the market and farmers,” said Mr. Fadnavis. Farmer leaders like Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana (SSS) chief Raju Shetti and Dr. Ajit Nawale of the Left-affiliated All Indian Kisan Sabha (AIKS) hit out at the Budget, stating that it failed to take into account the soaring costs of agricultural production and inputs. Mr. Shetti claimed that the Finance Minister’s announcement of the 2.37 lakh crore MSP procurement was actually lower than the Rs. 2.47 lakh crore MSP procurement allocation in last year’s Budget.  “For all the Finance Minister’ talk about digital revolution in agriculture, one cannot cultivate grain and grapes on Facebook and Instagram…the MSP procurement sop is no good unless there is a firm legislation on it,” said Mr. Shetti, speaking to
The Hindu from New Delhi.
 He further alleged that earmarking for the agriculture sector was just 3.76% as compared to 4.36% in last year’s budget. “The Modi government had promised 60 lakh new jobs. But the two sectors – textiles and sugar – which have the maximum potential in generating employment, find no mention in the budget in this regard,” claimed Mr. Shetti, a former two-time MP from Hatkanangale in western Maharashtra’s Kolhapur district. Dr. Nawale of the AIKS said that the Central government had not announced any new scheme to provide basic protection to farmers nor made enough financial provision to protect the prices of perishable crops like tomatoes, onions, vegetables and fruits. “The Centre’s policies have led to rising costs of agricultural production with farmers suffering due to a dramatic surge in petrol, diesel, electricity and fuel prices. Farmers had hoped that production costs would reduce by a reduction in fuel prices, but instead, the Union Finance Minister has reiterated ‘zero-budget’ farming based on highly unscientific concepts,” he said.", Shoumojit Banerjee,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/union-budget-2022-devendra-fadnavis-hails-msp-allocation-farmer-leaders-call-it-disappointing/article38361950.ece

I congratulate the Union Government for presenting a balanced budget,” said Mr. Kumar while adding, “the Union Government’s decision to build infrastructure on a large scale in the country is also laudable”. Mr. Kumar further said, “It has also been decided in the Budget to increase the volume of procurement of paddy and wheat. Farmers will be hugely benefited from this decision.” Besides, “It has been announced that a corridor for natural farming will be developed on a stretch of five kilometres on the banks of river Ganga. This step of the Union Government is laudable,” he said, while adding that Bihar government had been developing a corridor for organic farming from its own resources in 13 districts on both sides of the river.  However, his party’s parliamentary board chairman and key political aide, Upendra Kushwaha described the Budget as “disappointing”. “It might be historic for developed States but for Bihar it is disappointing. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman disappointed the people of Bihar by not saying anything on their demand for granting special status to the State,” tweeted Mr. Kushwaha soon after the Budget was presented in the Lok Sabha. Mr. Kushwaha also added a hashtag at the bottom of his tweet saying,
‘desh ka pradhan, Bihar per dein dhyan  (country’s head, kindly focus on Bihar)”.

It comes at a time when the pandemic has worsened inequality not only in the country but across the globe. In line with suggestions made by CII, the strategy laid out by the Budget is to spend on infrastructure projects to create jobs and enhance demand. For enhancing productivity and investment, the government’s continued focus on public capital expenditure, especially the PM Gati Shakti scheme, is notable. The substantial increase in CapEx outlay of 35% to ₹7.5 lakh crore during FY2022-23 would help pump-prime the economy and demand not only in the said year but also in the years ahead.

 This Budget’s reform-oriented approach of improving the business environment by introducing EODB 2.0 — which has its foundations in trust-based governance, and aims to digitalize manual processes while at the same time targeting integration of central and State-level compliances — will certainly help unlock the growth potential of the industry. Investments in the logistics infrastructure would lower the cost of doing business. Several measures have been announced to relieve the stress faced by the common man. The Budget has focused on inclusivity by targeting the bottom of the pyramid through welfare schemes. The increased allocation to the PM Awas Yojana to benefit the weaker section of the population and the launch of new schemes like PM-DevINE, Aspirational Blocks, and Vibrant Villages Programme are inspiring for achieving all-rounded, inclusive growth. The government’s initiatives for the agriculture sector, especially the announcement of assured income amounting to ₹2.37 lakh crore on account of direct payments for MSP of wheat and paddy, will help alleviate stress among farmers. The Budget’s priority areas — Gati Shakti, inclusive development, sunrise opportunities, energy and climate action, and financing of investment — set the vision for the country’s future. With all sectors contributing to growth, the Economic Survey growth target of 8.0-8.5% seems achievable in 2022-23, making India the fastest-growing major economy for two consecutive years. T.V.

The two budgets since then, in 2020 and 2021, endeavoured to address the health emergency, while minimising the impact on economy. Those efforts have borne results, with the nation dealing with the Omicron wave in a measured manner, while all GDP forecasts for 2021-22 and 2022-23 have indicated that India will be the fastest growing nation in the world. Macro-economic indicators are positive too — growth in revenue receipts and capex, merchandise imports and exports rebounding, and high foreign exchange reserves.  Against this backdrop,
the Union Budget 2022 has signalled that mere recovery is not enough — India is aspirational, hungry for growth and ready for a quantum leap. To support that leap, the Budget has put in place a blueprint for the next two and a half decades. In that sense, this Budget is an articulation of ambition.
 That ambition is quite formidable — the extent to which infrastructure and logistics aspects were addressed, water and agriculture were focused on, manufacturing was accelerated, MSMEs were supported, sunrise sectors were identified, clean energy was incentivised, urban spaces were reimagined and the digital dividend was harnessed, all this demonstrated that the future of India will be built on twin pillars — strengthening our traditional backbone and building the models of the future.

681,"February 02, 2022",04:02 IST,business,budget,Union Budget 2022 | Best spending mix in 18 years," The Union Budget has budgeted for a big push to capex, attempting only modest fiscal consolidation. The fiscal deficit to GDP ratio is projected to ease somewhat to 6.4% in FY2023 from 6.9% in FY2022, and is much higher than market expectations. Nevertheless, the absolute size of the deficit is projected to rise to ₹16.6 trillion from ₹15.9 trillion estimated in FY2022. The increase in the size of the absolute deficit can largely be attributed to a sharp hike in capital spending, by as much as 24.5% to ₹7.5 trillion in FY2023 from the revised ₹6 trillion in FY2022. This increase is driven by four major factors: a large increase in allocation for the roads sector, a capital infusion into BSNL, and as much as ₹1 trillion as special assistance to the States for capital spending. The sharp increase in the allocation for capex has the potential to impart durability to the growth momentum and ‘crowd in’ investments by the private sector. Also ReadWatch | Highlights of Union Budget 2022-23 The Government of India (GoI) has offset the expansion in capex by remaining rather prudent on revenue expenditure, which is budgeted to rise by a mere 0.9% in FY2023. Consequently, total spending is projected to increase by a modest 4.6% in FY2023. More importantly, the relatively larger hike in capex vis-à-vis revex is expected to lead to an improvement in the GoI’s spending quality, with capex accounting for 19% of total spending in FY2023, up from 16% projected in FY2022 and an average of 12.6% during FY2019-2021. This is the best spending mix in 18 years. We believe that there are limited downside risks to the fiscal targets for FY2023. This is because the GoI has budgeted for a moderate growth in gross tax collections of 9.6%. Besides, the budgeted numbers for receipts on account of disinvestment are also quite realistic at ₹650 billion. These assumptions lend a fair degree of credibility to the Budget math. With the increase in the size of the fiscal deficit, the GoI’s gross and net market borrowings are estimated to witness a steep expansion to ₹15 trillion and ₹11.2 trillion, respectively, from ₹10.5 trillion and ₹7.8 trillion in FY2022. This has impacted the bond market sentiments, given the prevailing expectations of a decline in borrowings. High crude oil prices, inflationary pressures and the U.S. Fed signalling towards multiple rate hikes over CY2022 have already led to a rise in G-sec yields over the last two months. This coupled with elevated borrowing levels and ICRA’s expectation of a change in the RBI’s monetary policy stance to neutral in April 2022, followed by rate hikes of 50 bps in FY2023 are expected to continue to push yields higher.

Out of this, the State has received barely ₹5500 crore as repayment. This is nothing but injustice.

The Centre has also allocated ₹105 crore for FY23 towards the Raw Material Supply Scheme. The main increase is for cotton procurement by Cotton Corporation of India under the price support scheme. The Cotton Corporation will see allocation of ₹9,243 crore for the next financial year as against ₹8,440 crore in the revised budget allocation for the current year. This is for the committed liability of the government to the Corporation, said an official.

In its Revised Budget estimate for the 2021-22 fiscal, the government has pegged total subsidies at ₹4,33,108 crore against the actual Budget Estimate of ₹7,07,707 crore in the previous financial year. Out of this, the food subsidy is estimated to decline to ₹2,86,469 crore in the current fiscal from ₹5,41,330 crore in 2020-21, while petroleum subsidy is estimated to fall to ₹6,517 crore from ₹38,455 crore in the said period. However, fertilizer subsidy is estimated to increase to ₹1,40,122 crore during the ongoing fiscal from ₹1,27,922 crore in the previous fiscal. During the current fiscal, the Centre has hiked the subsidy for non-urea fertilizers several times due to a sharp rise in global prices. The move was aimed at ensuring that farmers continue to get di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) and other nutrients under the nutrient-based subsidy (NBS) policy at a reasonable rate. For the next fiscal, the government said total subsidies were estimated to decline further to ₹3,17,866 crore.", PTI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/union-budget-2022-government-subsidies-to-decline-by-39/article38361200.ece
691,"February 01, 2022",23:19 IST,business,budget,Union Budget 2022 | Govt. proposes new SEZ law," The government on Tuesday proposed to replace the existing law governing special economic zones (SEZs) with a new legislation to enable States to become partners in ‘Development of Enterprise and Service Hubs’. The existing SEZ Act was enacted in 2006 with an aim to create export hubs and boost manufacturing in the country. However, these zones started losing their sheen after imposition of minimum alternate tax and introduction of sunset clause for removal of tax incentives. These zones are treated as foreign entities in terms of provisions related to customs. Industry has time and again demanded continuation of tax benefits provided under the law. Units in SEZs used to enjoy 100% income tax exemption on export income for the first five years, 50% for the next five years and 50% of the ploughed back export profit for another five years. Presenting the Budget 2022-23 , Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said: “The Special Economic Zones Act will be replaced with a new legislation that will enable the states to become partners in Development of Enterprise and Service Hubs.” This will cover all large existing and new industrial enclaves to optimally utilise available infrastructure and enhance competitiveness of exports, she noted.

 The government, she said, will also undertake reforms in customs administration of SEZs with a view to promote ease of doing business. “We will also undertake reforms in Customs Administration of SEZs and it shall henceforth be fully IT driven and function on the Customs National Portal with a focus on higher facilitation and with only risk-based checks,” the Minister said. This reform will be implemented by September 30, 2022. Commenting on the announcement, Rajat Bose, Partner, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co, said replacement of the SEZ Act with a new legislation is a pragmatic step as this will integrate these zones and Customs administration. Mahesh Jaising, Partner, Deloitte India, said the new legislation would help enable states to partner with the industry. In the Budget 2016-17, the government had announced that the income tax benefits to new SEZ units would be available to only those units which commence activity before March 31, 2020. As on January 27, the government has given formal approvals to 425 SEZ developers. Out of this, 268 were operational till December 31, 2021. As on September 30, 2021, these zones had attracted Rs 6,28,565.89 crore investments and employed 25,60,286 persons. During April-December this fiscal, exports from these zones rose by 25 per cent to Rs 6.89 lakh crore (USD 92.83 billion).

To this end, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the government envisioned an “additional allocation” of ₹19,500 crore as a “production-linked incentive” for manufacturing solar modules. She referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statements in Glasgow at the COP 26 last November of India striving to achieve ‘net zero’ carbon emissions by 2070. As part of this, India would increase its non-fossil energy capacity to 5,00,000 MW by 2030 and meet 50% of its energy requirements from renewable energy by 2030. “This strategy opens up huge employment opportunities and will take the country on a sustainable development path. This Budget proposes several near-term and long-term actions accordingly,” she said. The Central Electricity Authority in its latest assessment has said as of early November, solar accounted for 11.8% of the installed capacity and had increased from 11.3% from four months ago. In the run-up to COP-26, the U.S. and India agreed to collaborate towards installing 4,50,000 MW of renewable energy by 2030.  India’s installed power capacity is projected to be 4,76,000 MW by 2021-22 and is expected to rise to at least 8,17,000 MW by 2030. Observers lauded the references to “climate action”. “By referring to climate action as a sunrise sector and employment generator, the Budget 2022 had sent an important signal to markets, financial institutions and the workforce.

693,"February 01, 2022",22:53 IST,business,budget,Union Budget 2022 | Painting a bold vision for India@100,"  Another Budget speech has come and gone! As the dust settles, experts will analyse the fine print, pro-government voices will shower praise on the
Finance Minister for her ‘visionary’ budget , and with equal vigour, critics will pour scorn on the ‘unimaginative anti-poor’ budget! This is the lot of every FM.
 Viewing it dispassionately, however, one must commend Nirmala Sitharaman for resisting the temptation of pandering to vote banks, especially in the context of the upcoming elections in key States. Equally, she has made bold to leave direct taxes almost untouched, notwithstanding the myriad demands for raising of exemption limits and increases in deductions under various sections of the Income Tax Act. Admittedly, there were some justifiable demands for reliefs, especially from the much-harried salaried class, especially in these COVID-19 pandemic-ridden times. The FM has, however, chosen to look beyond the here and now, and painted a bold vision for India@100! While the Budget paints a wide and varied canvas, there are two areas that I specifically choose to focus on. The PM Gati Shakti master plan covering roads, railways, airports, ports, mass transport, waterways and logistics infra, is indeed a laudable step, given the wide-ranging benefits it confers across various sectors such as cement, steel, commercial vehicles, and earthmoving and construction equipment, not to speak of its vast employment generating potential. India has already derived significant benefits from the Golden Quadrilateral, and as more of our roads become world-class, these benefits will only increase. The idea of a master plan to focus on the entire spectrum of goods and people movement has, therefore, not come a day too soon. The sharp increase in public capital expenditure by 35.4% to ₹7.50 lakh crore in 2022-23, is an equally welcome step, although the actual spending in the current fiscal appears to be tardy. It is one thing to allocate, and quite another to spend! Also ReadWatch | Highlights of Union Budget 2022-23
 
 Considering the additional committed expenditure allocations of the government, in a pandemic year, there were concerns that the government would see a slippage on its fiscal deficit target. Happily, there appears to be only a marginal slippage at 6.9%, as against a budget target of 6.8% of GDP in 2021-22, which is projected to come down to 6.4% next year. The key concerns for the government in the coming fiscal would be international crude oil prices and the intensity and trajectory of the ongoing pandemic. If, as the Cassandras predict, prices hit $120 per barrel, there will be serious implications, both from the balance of payments and inflation perspectives, and could very well be disruptive of the ambitious plans outlined by the FM. Similarly, should the pandemic — God forbid — continue to wreak its debilitating consequences on lives and livelihoods, the engines of growth are likely to sputter. Hopefully, these dire situations will not come to pass. I had written in this column some years ago, that the most difficult and thankless job of all in our country is that of the FM.

Union Budget speech on Tuesday.
 “For delivery of digital and hi-tech services to farmers with the involvement of public sector research and extension institutions along with private agri-tech players and stakeholders of agri-value chain, a scheme through PPP [public-private partnership] mode will be launched,” said Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.  She added that a fund with blended capital, raised under the co-investment model, would be facilitated through NABARD. “This is to finance start-ups for agriculture and rural enterprise, relevant for farm produce value chain. The activities for these start-ups will include,
inter alia , support for FPOs, machinery for farmers on rental basis and technology, including IT-based support,” said Ms. Sitharaman.
 With a wider focus on drone technology, the Minister promised to promote the use of “kisan drones” for crop assessment, digitisation of land records, and spraying of insecticides and nutrients on fields. In fact, the Budget speech emphasised the efficient use of land resources via technology. “States will be encouraged to adopt Unique Land Parcel Identification Number to facilitate IT-based management of records. The facility for transliteration of land records across any of the Schedule VIII languages will also be rolled out,” she said.  “The adoption or linkage with National Generic Document Registration System (NGDRS) with the ‘One-Nation One-Registration Software’, will be promoted as an option for uniform process for registration and ‘anywhere registration’ of deeds and documents,” said Ms. Sitharaman. “The move to have NABARD facilitate funding of start-ups with a blended capital finance model should provide much needed seed capital in the agriculture & rural space,” said AgroStar CEO Shardul Sheth. “The expansion of technology focus from just tractors and agri-machinery to ‘kisan drones’ shows a rising interest in the application of IOT in the sector,” said Sheth. He added that the “PPP model to be launched for delivery of digital and high-tech services to farmers, will help farmers improve yields and increase output as we ourselves have seen. This Budget should help in accelerating the digitisation of the farming community,” he added. “The emphasis on digital infrastructure for infusion of agriculture technologies in a PPP mode will be the need of the hour in the next 25 years to combat the serious threat of climate change,” said Chief Sustainability Officer of Syngenta India K.C.

696,"February 01, 2022",22:31 IST,business,budget,Union Budget 2022 | Farmers’ unions allege ‘attitude of revenge’," Agriculture and allied activities, which still employ the largest bulk of the population, saw a marginal 2% increase in Budget allocations for 2022-23. The sector’s share in the overall Budget allocations fell from 4.26% in 2021-22 to 3.84%. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced high levels of payment for procurement of rice and paddy at the minimum support price (MSP), and her speech’s focus was on agricultural technology and start-ups that enthused the nascent industry. However, farmers’ groups expressed unhappiness at the lack of support for procurement of produce other than rice and paddy and a reduction in fertilizer subsidies. The Centre’s target of doubling farmers’ income by 2022, a standard motto of recent Budget speeches, found no mention this time.
 One of the few schemes that saw a clear increase in allocations is the Blue Revolution initiative to augment fisheries infrastructure, aquaculture and seafood processing. The Fisheries Department saw its budget almost double from ₹1,220 crore in 2021-22 to ₹2,118 crore. “The procurement of wheat in Rabi 2021-22 and the estimated procurement of paddy in Kharif 2021-22, will cover 1,208 lakh metric tonnes of wheat and paddy from 163 lakh farmers, and ₹2.37 lakh crore direct payment of MSP value to their accounts,” the Finance Minister said.

 “These figures are a serious reduction compared to 2020-21, when 1,286 lakh metric tonnes were procured from 197 lakh farmers, and ₹2.48 lakh crores were paid to the farmers. The number of benefited farmers in 2021-22 has fallen by 17% and the quantity procured has fallen by 7% from 2020-21,” said an assessment by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM). Farm unions were bitter about the failure to prioritise agricultural expenditure. “It is clear from this Budget that the government is working with an attitude of revenge against farmers. It has failed to deliver on its promise to double farm incomes by this year,” said Rakesh Tikait, who heads a faction of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) in Uttar Pradesh. The failure to hike PM-KISAN payouts, the slashing of the PM-ASHA scheme budget from ₹400 crore to ₹1 crore and the low levels of disbursement from the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund were identified as key issues. The agriculture industry, on the other hand, largely welcomed the announcements. Dhanuka Agritech Group chairman R.G. Agarwal welcomed the government’s focus on infrastructure and promotion of drones for farm activities. “However, it would have been also apt had the Finance Minister reduced the GST and customs duty rates on some of the agro-chemical products, which would have reduced the overall cost for the farmers,” he added. “The announcement in this year’s Budget on strengthening the delivery of digital and hi-tech services to farmers through the public-private partnership model will go a long way in helping Indian farmers reap the benefits of technological advancements,” Bayer’s South Asia president D. Narain said. “Major initiatives like promoting the use of ‘Kisan drones’, funds to finance start-ups for agriculture and rural enterprises, supporting FPOs through these enterprises, and boosting domestic oilseed production, have the potential to transform the sector,” he added.",The Hindu Bureau,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/union-budget-2022-farmers-unions-allege-attitude-of-revenge/article38360836.ece

Of course, if you are talking about numbers, credit, liquidity and also supply and demand of essential goods and other you keep in mind inflation,” she said at the customary post-Budget media briefing in Delhi. On how middle class expectations of additional relief in income tax were shattered, the Finance Minister, switching to Hindi, said, “I did not increase tax last year and this year [too]. I did not make any attempt to earn even one paise additionally.” Prime Minister Narendra Modi had repeated the instruction he gave last year that irrespective of fiscal deficit increasing, people should not be burdened with (additional taxes) during a pandemic, she added.  To another query, Ms .Sitharaman said she did not want to sound cynical by saying that no increase is in itself a
rahat (relief). “I am not saying that. There are times when you can give [tax relief], there are times when it will have to wait a bit longer. I am sorry it didn’t happen. Nevertheless, the middle class still stands to benefit from the number of schemes and support measures unveiled for other sectors,” the Minister said. “Isn’t there middle class among farmers, in MSMEs, [beneficiaries of] affordable homes, senior citizens, haven’t they got relief,” Ms. Sitharaman asked.
 On the contentious issue of privatisation of two banks, which has faced massive opposition from employees and influenced the decision of the government to table the Bill, she said the Budget continued with a holistic policy approach unveiled in the previous edition.  “It is inclusive of privatisation that you are talking about. We are continuing that agenda. I said Air India [divestment], have done that,” she asserted.  On the Budget proposal to levy tax on profit from digital asset transactions, the Finance Minister said it would not apply to the digital currency that the RBI will issue this year.  Without specifically referring to NFTs (non-fungible tokens), which are mentioned in the Finance Bill, Ms. Sitharaman said: “Everything [that] prevails outside of [digital currency] are digital assets, which are being created by individuals and in transacting that assets if profits are being made, we are taxing that profit at 30%. We are also tracking every trail of money in that by saying every transaction will (attract) 1% TDS in the crypto world.”  On the need for regulation, the Finance Minister said, “We have circulated a [discussion] paper, inputs are coming in, public stakeholders are also talking about it. So regulation goes through that process. I can’t wait till regulation comes into place for taxing people who are earning profits, can I?”  Regarding another proposal to impose an additional basic excise duty of ₹2 a litre on petrol and diesel, intended to be sold to retail consumers without blending, from October 1, 2022, the Minister and Revenue Secretary Tarun Bajaj said the intent was to encourage blended fuel.

However, for the current fiscal, the government estimates the receipts to be higher at ₹71,959.24 crore as against the budget estimates of ₹53,986.72 crore from ‘other communication services’. Receipts under 'other communication services' mainly relate to the licence fees from telecom operators and receipts on account of spectrum usage charges.  The government will make a capital infusion of ₹44,720 crore in state-owned BSNL in 2022-23 — the majority of this year’s estimated capital expenditure, the Budget documents show. “The provision is made for capital infusion for 4G Spectrum, technology upgradation and restructuring in BSNL,” as per the document. Additionally, the government will provide additional financial support of ₹3,300 crore to the telecom firm for voluntary retirement scheme and ₹3,550 crore as grant-in-aid for payment of GST. Sabyasachi Majumdar, Senior Vice-President & Group Head, Corporate Ratings, ICRA Limited, said overall, the budget focussed on increasing the digital penetration in the country by way of e-learning, digital health programmes and digital banking. This is likely to propel the usage of telecom services. Likewise, Sandeep Aggarwal, Chairman, Telecom Equipment Promotion Council (TEPC), welcomed the announcement of 5G auctions. However, he called for ‘free or low cost spectrum’ to be given to all users and operators initially, and when the market matures in 2-3 years, the government can go for auction. “This will get better prices and encourage healthy competition in the telecom sector…duty reduction in the telecom sector will be conducive to growth,” he added. Peeyush Vaish, Partner and Telecom Sector Leader, Deloitte India noted that the USO funds have historically been used for the rural infrastructure roll-out. A 5% allocation towards R&D and commercialization of the technology could help some of the indigenous niche players building up technologies around O-RAN and Private networks. “....FM’s announcement around the 5G spectrum auction, 100 percent fiberisation with PPP model will provide the required impetus to build upon ubiquitous and reliable internet connectivity. Thereby, bridging the digital divide for a conducive and inclusive development of the nation in keeping with the ‘Digital India’ initiative. Further, design-led initiatives for 5G under the PLI scheme and 5% of USOF for R&D purposes will strengthen the ‘Make in India’ initiative, and contribute to making India a global manufacturing hub,” Nitin Bansal, MD, India & Head-Networks - Southeast Asia, Oceania, and India at Ericsson, said.", Yuthika Bhargava,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/union-budget-2022-5g-services-auction-roll-out-likely-in-2022-23-says-finmin/article38360702.ece

704,"February 01, 2022",22:00 IST,business,budget,Union Budget 2022 | Medium Wave,"  Union Finance Minister
Nirmala Sitharaman, presenting her fourth Budget and the second one in a pandemic-hit economy on Tuesday, largely stuck to the broad script from last year, scaling up the wager on public capital spending to revive private investments and job creation through a virtuous growth cycle, while keeping an eye on the country’s macro fiscal health.
  This Budget, presented in the 75 year of Independence, sets the stage for an
Amrit Kaal ( time of nectar) over the next 25 years, culminating in a vision for India in 2047 as enunciated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his I-Day address last year, she said.
 Beginning her 90-minute speech with an expression of empathy for Indians who grappled with the health and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Ms. Sitharaman invoked a verse
 from the
Mahabharat before placing her tax proposals for 2022-23. This included the levy of a 30% tax on all profits from transactions pertaining to virtual digital assets or crypto assets, bringing some clarity over a grey area for investors even as further regulations are being worked out.
 “The king must make arrangements for Yogakshema (welfare) of the populace by way of abandoning any laxity and by governing the state in line with Dharma, along with collecting taxes which are in consonance with the Dharma,” the Minister recited, adding that the government is drawing wisdom from ‘our ancient texts’ on the path to progress. Summary of Union Budget 2022-23 The salaried and the middle class, however, got no direct relief in the form of tax breaks to counter inflation and the COVID-hit on incomes and jobs, nor was there any significant nudge to spur private consumption that is likely to end 2021-22 below pre-pandemic levels. Ms. Sitharaman pointed out that the government has not raised taxes in these COVID-affected budgets, but stressed that several proposals aimed at helping farmers, startups, micro, small and medium enterprises as well as affordable housing projects will ultimately benefit the middle classes. “There are times when you can give [relief], there are times when it will have to wait a bit longer,” she noted. Contact-intensive services sectors like hospitality that are also languishing under 2019-20 levels, did get a helping hand with the expansion of the existing ₹4.5 lakh crore Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme to ₹5 lakh crore, with the window to avail this support extended by a year till March 2023. The Minister conceded that jobs have been affected due to the pandemic’s effects around the world, but emphasised that the government has been taking steps to help. Production Linked Incentives for 14 sectors alone have the potential to create 60 lakh new jobs in the coming five years, she said. Highlights of Union Budget 2022-23 While the Budget marked a continuation of strategy adopted in the last Budget to lift the economy from the COVID lockdown-induced plunge of 2020-21, reflected in the Minister reiterating several measures announced last year with fresh outlays, some silences rankled even as others were heartening. For instance, a fresh push was made on creating liveable cities and a better planning framework for urban areas where half of Indians are expected to live by 2047 but there was no talk of the government’s existing programmes to build smart cities. On the other hand, without mentioning China, the Budget promised a convergence of existing border area development programmes to provide better physical and digital connectivity to villages with sparse populations on the ‘northern border’. Similarly, it was refreshing that there was no overtly populist measure in the Budget to woo voters in ongoing State Assembly polls. While the economy has shown strong resilience over the past year, the Finance Minister said greater capital spending is needed to sustain the recovery and enhanced the Centre’s capex plan to ₹7.50 lakh crore in 2022-23, which she emphasised is over 2.2 times the outlay in 2019-20. Separately, in a move that should also reduce federal friction, she also announced a ₹1 lakh crore 50-year interest-free loan for States to pursue critical capital spending projects, aligned with the PM Gati Shakti programme, digitisation or urban reforms. A similar ₹10,000 crore window announced for 2021-22 has been enhanced to ₹15,000 crore in deference to State CMs’ requests, Ms. Sitharaman said. The Minister said the listing of Life Insurance Corporation of India is expected shortly, which may well translate into a lower fiscal deficit than the 6.9% of GDP now projected for 2021-22. However, the ambitious ₹1.75 lakh disinvestment target for the year has been pared to ₹78,000 crore with the 2022-23 expectations set at a modest ₹65,000 crore. Rating agencies, like Moody’s Investors Service, reacted with caution to the Budget math that pegs fiscal deficit in 2022-23 at 6.4% of GDP without any significant revenue generation plans. “This suggests the government is relying on strong economic growth to help drive fiscal consolidation in light of the large bump in capital expenditure, and poses some uncertainty given the prevalence of pandemic-related risks,” noted Moody’s sovereign risk group senior vice president Christian de Guzman.", Vikas Dhoot,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/union-budget-2022-medium-wave/article38360673.ece

Finance Miniser Nirmala Sitharaman said VCs and PE investors infused more than ₹5.5 lakh crore last year facilitating one of the largest start-up and growth ecosystems. “Scaling up this investment requires a holistic examination of regulatory and other frictions. An expert committee will be set up to examine and suggest appropriate measures,” she said in her Budget speech. The committee will help address issues around coordination among multiple agencies and departments such as the RBI, SEBI, Finance Ministry, DPIIT and Commerce Ministry, said Naganand Doraswamy, Founder and Managing Partner, Ideaspring Capital. “The combined value that Indian start-ups so far have generated is more than $400 billion and this is expected to reach $1 trillion by 2025. The ecosystem hence needs specific policies and recognition as a sector. Proposal to set up an expert committee is a positive step and the industry is hopeful that some of the key issues will be resolved soon,” he added. The proposal only highlighted the importance the government was giving the role of PE/VC industry, said Andy Khanna, partner, Deloitte India. “Setting up an expert committee to examine the ecosystem from regulatory and other perspectives and suggest measures should help in the growth of the business.

706,"February 01, 2022",21:14 IST,business,budget,Union Budget 2022 | Rationalisation of Customs duty rates to boost domestic electronic manufacturing: Finance Minister," Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday announced the rationalisation of the Customs duty rates for certain components to facilitate domestic manufacturing of high-growth electronic goods, wearable devices, and electronic smart meters.  “Electronic manufacturing has been growing rapidly. Customs duty rates are being calibrated to provide a graded rate structure to facilitate domestic manufacturing of wearable devices, hearable devices and electronic smart meters,”
she said in her Budget speech .
 Ms. Sitharaman stated that duty concessions were also being given to parts of the transformer of mobile phone chargers and camera lens of mobile camera module and certain other items. “This will enable domestic manufacturing of high growth electronic items,” she observed. The India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) welcomed the calibration of Customs duty for hearables and wearables and on parts of transformers of chargers, as well as lens as part of camera module. However, “a long road remains, especially for the continued high basic Customs duty of high-end mobile phones [phones with a CIF value higher than ₹20,000].” “We emphasise that rationalisation of the BCD is essential to curb the grey market, increase revenue generation, and give a fillip to the industry,” it noted. The ICEA has written to Ajay Prakash Swahney, Secretary, Ministry of Electronics and IT, stating that while the the BCD rationalisation on camera lens for use in manufacture of camera module from 15% to 2.5% was welcome, “we had asked for revert to the position before February 2021, because even 2.5% is completely unnecessary”. “The nuisance tariff on 2.5% on various inputs, eg. ferrite inductors for the PCBA of chargers and inductors for the PCBA for mobiles, continue. Other parts of the camera module like actuator assembly and parts of sensor continue at 2.5%, which is again unnecessary,” it added. Nikhil Mathur, Managing Director, India, & Head, Data Partnership & Innovation-APAC, GfK said the government’s growth-oriented goals led by the digital economy and tech-enabled developments would boost the consumer and electronics industry penetration across the country. GfK insights indicated similar positive trends as the consumer landscape was evolving in lower-tier towns. “The calibration in Custom duties for ""wearable and hearable"" devices will provide an impetus for higher growth in 2022…The underlying theme of ‘Atmanirbhar’ & ‘Make in India’ will undoubtedly create job opportunities, bringing a positive outlook towards domestic demand of consumer tech products in India.” Mr. Mathur added that the industry was expecting rationalisation of GST for appliances and electronics that would have enhanced the consumption.", Yuthika Bhargava,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/union-budget-2022-rationalisation-of-customs-duty-rates-to-boost-domestic-electronic-manufacturing-finance-minister/article38360489.ece
707,"February 01, 2022",21:10 IST,business,budget,Union Budget 2022 | A catalyst for inclusive growth," The Budget has attempted to balance near-term growth imperatives with long-term priorities.  In line with expectations, a big push has been accorded to infrastructure and logistics via Gati Shakti. The National Master Plan aims to massively upgrade India’s infrastructure; this will not just support near-term growth but will enhance the competitiveness of the Indian industry. The focus on 7 key engines helps to bring about much-needed synergy between infrastructure and logistics sectors. National Highway expansion by 25,000 km is a vital cog in this scheme. Gati Shakti is expected to create 60 lakh new jobs. The financing plan for these investments now looks much more robust and credible; both the Centre and States will now need to focus on its speedy implementation.  Delivery of digital and hi-tech services, the use of drones and a fund to finance agri start-ups are steps to ensure that agriculture growth does not falter. The agriculture sector has strong backward and forward linkages, which impacts the industry and overall economic growth. The Centre’s capex outlay of ₹7.5 trillion is significantly beyond expectations. This is a morale booster for corporates betting on capital spending in the future as public investment crowds in private capex. This reinforces my firm belief that a ‘Capex Mahotsav’ is on the anvil in India. As the third COVID wave ebbs, demand outlook improves and recovery takes shape, private capex is sure to follow suit. Signs of this are evident in announcements made by many companies. In short, the budget aims to achieve overall macroeconomic growth and human welfare with a sharp focus on infrastructure, inclusive development, thrust to sunrise sectors, climate action and financing of investments.",Kumar Mangalam Birla,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/union-budget-2022-a-catalyst-for-inclusive-growth/article38360478.ece

 The Budget for the Ministry of Women and Child Development as a portion of the expenditure has also declined from 0.57% to 0.51%. The Ministry received ₹20,263.07 crore. The FM said nearly two lakh anganwadis will be upgraded and will be “new generation anganwadis that have better infrastructure and audio-visual aids, powered by clean energy and providing improved environment for early child development.” However, the Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 scheme, under which these works will be carried out, have received a negligible hike of 0.7%. No enhanced allocation was announced for nutrition support or to address the demands of frontline workers for minimum wages instead of an honorarium. The schemes under the Ministry that focus on safety of women such as Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao, One Stop Centres, Nari Adalat, Mahila Police Volunteer and Women’s Helpline saw a decline in allocation from ₹587 crore to ₹562 crore.

709,"February 01, 2022",20:53 IST,business,budget,Big push to improve connectivity to villages on China border," In a major push to develop and improve connectivity in border areas, villages along the northern border will see development under the new Vibrant Villages Programme, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced on Tuesday.  The move comes in the backdrop of China setting up “model villages” close to the Line of Actual Control (LAC). “Border villages with sparse population, limited connectivity and infrastructure often get left out from the development gains. Such villages on the northern border will be covered under the new Vibrant Villages Programme,” Ms. Sitharaman said in her Budget speech. “The activities will include construction of village infrastructure, housing, tourist centres, road connectivity, provisioning of decentralised renewable energy, direct to home access for Doordarshan and educational channels, and support for livelihood generation.”  Additional funding for these activities would be provided and existing schemes converged, she stated. “We will define their outcomes and monitor them on a constant basis,” she stated. There is already a broader Border Area Development Plan undertaken by the Ministry of Home Affairs for development of all border States.   The 2021 annual report of the U.S. Department of Defence (DoD) to the U.S. Congress on military and security developments involving the People’s Republic of China (PRC) had noted: “Sometime in 2020, the PRC built a large 100-home civilian village inside disputed territory between the PRC’s Tibet Autonomous Region and India’s Arunachal Pradesh State in the eastern sector of the LAC.”  Responding to questions on such “model villages” by China, Lt. Gen. Pande, who assumed charged as the Army’s Vice Chief said last October that the concern was the “dual use” nature, civil and military, of these villages and “we have taken note of these in our operational plans.”  To counter Chinese moves, a border development plan to populate border areas along the LAC with local population has been under discussion for sometime.

710,"February 01, 2022",21:11 IST,business,budget,Union Budget 2022 | ‘Unchanged tax slab disappointing’," The Finance Minister’s Budget Speech was a short one, and she made only a handful of references to the direct tax changes envisaged. Nonetheless, the Finance Bill is a detailed one, and contains several important, albeit low-key amendments on the direct tax front. On the all-important topic of personal tax rates, the Budget contains no major changes. This will come as a disappointment to many who were expecting relief from changes to slabs, a lowering of rates, or at least through an increase in key tax deductions. Some benefit by way of COVID relief is, however, provided both in respect of treatment costs as well as in respect of sums paid to family members of those who passed away in the pandemic. In a sense, with strong domestic demand and the looming threat of inflation, perhaps the government chose to adopt a wait-and-watch approach towards tax relief, despite the imminent elections in key States. However, this is something that the government may have to consider in the coming years, especially if tax collections continue to remain buoyant. On the procedural side, there is an important change that will enable taxpayers to update their returns beyond the short existing time limits for filing belated returns. This will now be possible up to 2 years from the end of the assessment year, but comes with a cost — the taxpayer has to pay an additional tax of between 25% and 50% of the tax on the additional income declared in the updated return. This is a far reaching change, and will enable taxpayers to address inadvertent errors and obtain certainty without going through a complex and time consuming litigation process. For businesses, the tax proposals are something of a mixed bag. Start-ups established up to March 31, 2023 (instead of March 31, 2022) will now be eligible for tax relief.  Similarly, to avail of the concessional 15% tax rate, new manufacturing companies had to commence manufacture by March 31, 2023. This date has been extended to March 31, 2024. On the other hand, the scope of TDS has been extended to benefits or perquisites arising in the course of business. In fact, over the past few years, the scope of TDS provisions has been gradually increasing. Many taxpayers have expressed concern over this trend and suggested that the scope of TDS on domestic payments should be curtailed since this imposed significant compliance costs and led to significant litigation. The current amendments could add to this burden. Another important change is the withdrawal of the concessional 15% rate available in respect of dividends earned from foreign subsidiaries. Such dividends will now be taxed at normal rates.  The Budget also provides a detailed set of rules for taxing virtual digital assets, which would include crypto currencies and Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Gains from their transfer have been subject to a flat tax rate of 30% with no deduction for any expenditure (other than cost) or any set off of losses.  TDS on payments for their transfer has also been introduced, and provisions relating to gifts have been expanded to include them. The restriction on set-off of realised losses against gains is unusual, considering that income tax law has long allowed set off and carry forward of losses in speculative businesses, albeit with a restriction that such losses can be used only against speculative profits. It is not clear why this principle could not be applied to virtual assets.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/union-budget-2022-unchanged-tax-slab-disappointing/article38360148.ece
711,"February 01, 2022",20:04 IST,business,budget,Union Budget 2022 | A roadmap for economic revival," Hon’ble Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented a balanced and growth oriented budget with a strong emphasis on long term growth and avoided any announcement of election-related populist measures. It focused on four pillars — productivity, climate action, financing investments & PM Gati Shakti plan— and has laid a roadmap for economic revival, against the backdrop of uncertainty amidst the COVID-19 Infections. Though the fiscal deficit is tad higher at 6.9% for 2021-2022 and at6.4% for 2022-23, but given the 35% increase in capital expenditure, government has chosen to be pro-growth and has rightly refrained from undertaking aggressive fiscal consolidation at this early stage of economic recovery. The disinvestment target of ₹65,000croreseems to be conservative given that the divestment candidates are clearly identified and government now has a well-oiled process for divestment in place as it has successfully divested “AirIndia” — one of the most difficult ones to divest. Further, given the buoyancy in tax collections, it is highly possible that Budget will surpass revenue assumptions which to an extent will help fiscal consolidation and also improve the Tax to GDP ratio. Continuing the focus on the Prime Minister’s vision of ‘Housing For All’, the Finance Minister announced 80 lakh homes to be built by 2023 under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). Additionally,the Budget made an allocation of ₹48,000 crore under PMAY urban and rural for building these homes. Further, the government has rightly acknowledged the need to reduce time required for land and construction related approvals for promoting affordable housing for middle class and economically weaker sections in urban areas. This will be extremely helpful in scaling up the execution of PMAY across geographies. India has seen a massive rise in start-ups in the last few years. The Budget has focused more on the Made in India initiative to minimise thedependency. To encourage the start-up ecosystem government has introduced flexible policies to help start-ups. The use of drones for start-ups will push for excellence. The promotion of fintech and technology-based development will help the economy gain a pace as well as create a better job prospects for individuals. Micro,Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) continue to be the backbone of economic growth.In a bid to boost local manufacturing and promote self-reliance, FM announced extending the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) up to March 2023. This will go a long way in supporting the MSME sector and revive industrial activities. The Budget also focuses on sustainable and equitable growth. There is push for tech excellence. Infrastructure status given to Data Centres will provide a huge boost to the fast evolving digital environment of thecountry. Moving towards digital economy, the Budget announced the launch of CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) in2022-23. The introduction of digital rupee will give a big boost to the digital economy and bring in efficient currency management. The pandemic has made people recognise the importance of a roof over one’s head. The government could have given further boost to the housing sector through tax benefits given the strong multiplier effect the sector has on the economy. The CLSS schemes under the PMAY have been a great example of a successful Public- Private partnership and its extension especially for the EWS and LIG category would have helped immensely to achieve the goal of “Housing for All” (Renu Sud Karnad is Managing Director – HDFC Limited)",Renu Sud Karnad,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/union-budget-2022-a-roadmap-for-economic-revival/article38360111.ece

MGNREGA is a demand driven scheme, guaranteeing 100 days of unskilled work to any rural household that wants it. During the first COVID-19 lockdown in 2020, when the scheme was ramped up and given its highest-ever budget of ₹1.11 lakh crore, it provided a critical lifeline for a record 11 crore workers.

  Supplementary allocations then pushed up the revised estimates to ₹98,000 crore, but workers say they paid the cost in delayed wage payments and artificial suppression of demand, while some State governments were forced to dip into their own coffers to meet costs. “The cut comes at a time when the country is going through its worst ever employment crisis. MNREGA is crucial because it reaches out to the last person in the line. With the current allocation, we will have a repeat of last year, when the funds ran out midway through the year and many crucial works will have to be stalled,” said Kerala Finance Minister K.N. Balagopal. “It is a terrible thing to do. But this is the Modi model of development,” added Amit Mitra, the Principal Chief Advisor to the West Bengal Chief Minister and a former Finance Minister of the State. Grassroots activists said the reduction in funding would have a disastrous impact on workers, especially as pending payments from the current year will also carry over into the next. “Approximately ₹12,300 crore — ₹1,464 crore as wages and ₹10,900 crore as material — is yet to be paid, which is going to eat up the next year’s budget. So effectively only about ₹60,700 crore is available for next year,” said Debmalya Nandy of the NREGA Sangharsh Morcha.

 “If the government wants to provide employment to all 9.94 crore active job card holding families, they will only be able to provide some 20 days as per the current per person per day average cost of ₹298. However, the wage rates will also increase and therefore, the scope of employment will further reduce,” he added. “The government is using the budget to kill the law,” said Nikhil Dey, a founder of the Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan. “This was the only programme that offered employment in a dangerous situation of jobless growth. The allocation does not even keep pace with the rate of inflation,” he added. “This will hit the rural economy quite badly.

714,"February 01, 2022",22:10 IST,business,budget,Union Budget 2022 | Stable health budget sees no changes from last year," The government perceives the pandemic to be in retreat, going by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s Budget speech as well as a perusal of the Budget documents. In 2021-22, the Budget documents show, the Centre ended up spending ₹82,920 crore — nearly ₹11,000 crore more — in the last Budget. This was largely in the form of ‘Grant in Aid’ to States. It proposes to spend around the same — ₹83,000 crore — over the coming financial year. The 2022 Budget estimate is nearly 16% more than the ₹71,000 crore budgeted last year. Further evidence that COVID-19 is seen as a diminished threat this year comes from allocation to a budgetary head called “India COVID-19 Emergency Response and Health System Preparedness” that saw an allotment of ₹12,359 crore last year but has seen zero allocation in the present year. In her address, however, Ms. Sitharaman stressed on improving access to mental healthcare facilities via telemedicine and digital healthcare facilities. Her speech didn’t mention vaccines, bettering hospitals, improving public health facilities — all major points that found mention in the previous two years.  “I recognise we are in the midst of an Omicron wave, with high incidence but milder symptoms. Further, the speed and coverage of our vaccination campaign has helped greatly. With the accelerated improvement of health infrastructure in the past two years, we are in a strong position to withstand challenges. I am confident that with
Sabka Prayas (everybody’s effort), we will continue our journey of strong growth,” Ms. Sitharaman said in her opening remarks.
 As of Monday, India has double vaccinated more than 75% of its eligible population, even as it posted close to 167,000 new cases in the last 24 hours. While allocations haven’t been hiked, the Centre also expects to spend the same as it did last year on health research. In 2021-22, the Centre alloted ₹2,663 crore for health research but spent ₹3,080 crore. This year, it has budgeted ₹3,200 crore. The capital expenditure that the Health Ministry expects to make in the coming year is ₹5,632 crore or about ₹1,000 crore less than was spent last year. The Pradhan Mantri Ayushman BharatHealth Infrastructure Mission (PMABHIM) has seen a substantial increase from ₹585 crore last year to ₹4,177 crore this year. A scheme to improve pandemic preparedness via research and development as well as strengthen “bio security” has also been hiked from ₹140 crore to ₹690 crore.",The Hindu Bureau,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/union-budget-2022-stable-health-budget-sees-no-changes-from-last-year/article38359879.ece

717,"February 01, 2022",18:56 IST,business,budget,Union Budget 2022 | Laying the foundation for Digital India 2.0," We still do not know if the worst is over. Neither do we know which way the wheels of fortune will swing with the Corona virus and what will be the impact of the next mutation. The oils prices are threateningly high, and drums of war are heard in Ukraine & Middle East.  But with all these risks, the FM presents the budget for a country that is a bright spot in an otherwise dark horizon. At 9.2%, India is the fastest-growing, large economy with over $630 billion of foreign reserves equaling 13 months of imports, inflation is under control and stock markets and corporate results shinning positively, and vaccination is a success with 93% of eligible population getting single dose and 70% fully vaccinated.  But the FM must know that there is a dark underbelly to the bright spot. That underbelly is unemployment rate. Officially, 7.2% is the unemployment rate but reality is far worse. It is possibly the single greatest challenge that the FM must address through her Budget. Clearly the FM has stepped up to the challenge. By allocating ₹7.5 Lakh crore in FY 23, which is 35% higher than previous year, she has clearly set the right tone. Infrastructure has triple effect. First employment, then revival of core sector and lastly productivity of the economy. We could not have asked for more.  Further, she has increased the Financial Assistance to States for capital Investments from ₹10,000 crore in FY22 to ₹1,00,000 crore in FY23. Clearly States are getting the right signal that they are partners with the Centre for building modern India. A large part of this focus is on PM Gatishakti, the initiatives to focus on logistics through development of roads, railways, airports etc. to ensure efficient movement of goods and this is aided by 100 multi-modal cargo terminals. Clearly, if Make In India is to succeed, Gatishakti initiative will play a vital role in making the cost of production competitive. Digital India is another theme that runs across the budget. From recognizing virtual assets as a taxable asset class, issuing digital currency, e-passports, Digital University, Council for AVGC (Gaming, Animation Sector), emphasis on digital banking, land record digitization, facilitating payment platforms, auctioning 5G spectrum, building optical fibre network are efforts that will build up digital capacity of the country, improve efficiency and further boost employment in the services sector.  The Amrit Kal initiative, plan for India completing 100 years post-Independence, presses the right button. Emphasis on urban planning and development, when 50% of India’s population will live in urban areas clearly is the right priority and will deeply improve quality of life and ease of doing business. So, what did the Budget miss? Healthcare was expected to get a greater share of allocation. The pandemic has exposed the deficiencies in hospital capacity. One would have expected a public-private initiative with PLI type of incentives to be thrown open to this sector. Privatization, the big initiative in last budget along with Asset Monetization has under delivered. One would have expected reforms to ensure that those get back on track.  While there is mention of light touch regulation for AI, Green Energy, Clean Mobility, more was expected to accelerate growth in these sunrise sectors. In closing, this Budget is foundational in its approach. It has its eyes set on 8.5% growth for FY23 and presses the right button to get the country there. An 8.5% on top of 9.2% in FY23 will bring India into the spotlight for investments. But there is a lot to be done before we get there. The devil is in implementation and with State elections a distraction and the ongoing pandemic, Team India has its hands full of challenges. The Budget has loaded the dice in favor of Team India. Now the time has come for it to deliver on its promises. ( Ashok Hinduja is Chairman, Hinduja Group of Companies (India)",Ashok P.

719,"February 01, 2022",18:30 IST,business,budget,Central budget undermines State's economy: Pinarayi Vijayan," Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the Union Budget sought to undermine the economy of individual States instead of bolstering their COVID-19 ravaged financial systems. Mr. Vijayan said the States had joined the Centre's GST regime in 2015-16 to rationalise many regional taxes and evolve a coherent value-added surcharge system for a range of goods and services. The tax homogenisation had cost States their revenue autonomy. The States feared colossal revenue loss. The Centre agreed to make up for any loss of domestic revenue in local taxes by paying GST compensation for five years. Though modest and not as per original expectations, the compensation payments would grind to a halt in June 2022. The Centre has not extended the period of GST compensation as demanded by the States in pre-Budget meetings. The States had requested not to stop GST compensation remittances till at least 2027. However, the Centre remained unmoved. The Union Budget would further imperil the State's precarious economy. Central tax devolution has not benefitted Kerala. The Budget held no promise for Central government-owned public sector entities in Kerala. Mr. Vijayan said the Budget overwhelmingly favoured disinvestment in critical national sectors, including railways, insurance and airlines. The Centre has incrementally rolled back government influence on the country's economy by pursuing free-market capitalism with a vengeance. Unbridled globalisation and neo economic liberalism had cost the country's poor dear. It had increased the income gap between the wealthy and impoverished and subverted the social security of the masses. ""The Centre's inhumaneness is evident in the Budget"", he said. The Budget has turned a blind eye to the travails of ordinary folk and marginalised sections of society. Social security pensions remain paltry. For one, it has declined to increase EPF minimum pension. There is no provision in the Budget to update the rural employment guarantee scheme. The Chief Minister said the PM Gati Shakti programme to link road, air, rail and other transport infrastructure for speedy and uninterrupted passenger and freight movement has not factored in the interests of individual States. India faced the highest inflation and price rise in the past three decades. However, the Budget offers no scheme to reach cash to the weaker sections to jump-start spending. The allocation for agriculture, food subsidy and rural employment has stagnated. Disappointingly, there is no allocation in the Union Budget for the proposed AIIMS in Kozhikode. The Chief Minister lauded the Centre for coopting Kerala's ""original schemes"", including digital university, online education and optical fibre network, into the Central Budget.",Special Correspondent,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/central-budget-undermines-states-economy-pinarayi-vijayan/article38359602.ece

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Tuesday while presenting the Union Budget 2022 in the second year of the COVID-19 that the pandemic had accentuated the mental health problems in people of all ages and announced the plan to set up a National Tele-Mental Health programme in India. The Minister announced that 23 tele-mental health centres would be launched with the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS) as the nodal centre.  Also ReadWatch | Highlights of Union Budget 2022-23 “To better the access to quality mental health counseling and care services, a National-Tele Mental Health programme will be launched. The Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) Bangalore, will provide tech support for the mental health programme,’’ she said. Besides this the Minister announced that an open platform for the national digital health ecosystem would be rolled out and it would consist of digital registries of health providers and health facilities, unique health identity and universal access to health facilities. Additional she said that 95% of 112 aspirational districts had made significant progress in health and other parameters and that efforts would now be made to work on districts that were lagging. The healthcare industry experts have expressed mixed reactions at the Budget with K. Sujatha Rao, former secretary, Health Ministry, tweeting: “A disappointing budget for health and education. Need to remember that roads and ports don’t make sense if people are illiterate and sick ! And such disdain for these human capability sectors after the trauma we have faced due to a poor health system is simply being irresponsible.’’ Rajiv Nath, forum coordinator, Association of Indian Medical Device Industry, also expressed deep disappointment and anguish, saying the Union Budget 2022 had given a cold shoulder again to the Indian medical device industry. He added that there was nothing laudable for the healthcare industry in the budget. Mr. Nath said that the industry was expecting the government to move forward on promised reforms and anticipated conducive measures to boost domestic manufacturing of medical devices. Stating that the Budget had no strategic measures to boost domestic manufacturing, he said that these were the same domestic manufacturers, when imports got disrupted during COVID-19 crisis, the government relied heavily on to meet the rising demand of essential COVID items for the country pushing the Indian medical devices sector to become self-reliant. ``It is frustrating that against our expectations, the government has not included any measures to help end the 80-85% import dependence forced upon India and an ever-increasing import bill of over ₹46,000 crore and promoting growth of the Indian medical device industry other than repeating last year’s assurance to end custom exemptions of products that can be made in India,’’ he said. “The only positive announcement was on public procurement by allowing 75% prompt payments and bringing in a weighted price preference on account of quality which is especially critical in healthcare related medical devices,” he added. The mental health component of the Budget came in for praise with Dr. Rana Mehta of the PwC India stating that the pandemic had caused a silent global mental health epidemic. The use of telemedicine to diagnose and treat such patients had proved to be highly effective given the unobtrusive nature of the interaction which also ensured patient privacy. “Given the shortage of mental health professionals, especially in rural areas, telemedicine would greatly enhance accessibility for patients requiring psychiatric help,” Dr. Mehta said. Dr. Ravi Wankhedkar, past president of the Indian Medical Association, said that the ‘devil is in the details’ — digital service in health sector is welcome but what about data security and patient confidentiality. These are biggest threats. Dr. Shuchin Bajaj, Founder Director, Ujala Cygnus Group of Hospitals, said, “When we were struggling with the massive pandemic second wave last year, we thought that the only silver lining out of this would be that the current state of health care facilities in the country would attract the attention of the government, especially the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister. And we will see a big push towards healthcare spending, at least to the promise 3% of the GDP that the government has been promising since a long time. Unfortunately, we haven’t heard much on health care and education in this budget. Overall haven’t had any exciting news so far from the Budget, which we were looking forward to.” Dr. Alok Roy, member, FICCI, Health Services Committee and Chairman Medica Group of Hospitals, said that it was expected that the government would look at increasing the healthcare expenditure above 2.5% of the GDP but there was not adequate attention paid to it. “Although there had been a rise of 137% allocation in healthcare sector last year, much was fulfilled in reality by the government. Overall, the proposals made in the Budget 22-23, should have made quality healthcare accessible and affordable. The government should have focused more on primary healthcare investment and made the healthcare system as National Priority’ status, as was done for the IT sector,” he said.", Bindu Shajan Perappadan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/union-budget-2022-boost-to-mental-healthcare-sector-welcome-others-services-ignored-experts/article38358339.ece

Currently, the cooperative societies are required to pay MAT at the rate of 18.5%, while the companies paid at the rate of 15%, she added.  Reducing the surcharge on cooperative societies from the present 12% to 7%, she said the reduction in surcharge is for those having a total income of more than ₹1 crore to up to ₹10 crore. “This will help in enhancing income of cooperative societies and its members who are mostly from the rural and from farming communities,” she added.", PTI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/union-budget-2022-government-proposes-to-reduce-mat-for-cooperative-societies-to-15-surcharge-to-7/article38358075.ece

Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday while presenting budget proposals said the government’s objective was to further simplify the tax system, promote voluntary compliance by taxpayers, and reduce litigation. She introduced ‘Updated return’ to provide taxpayers an opportunity to correct errors while filing returns or not reporting certain transactions. “I am proposing a new provision permitting taxpayers to file an Updated Return on payment of additional tax. This updated return can be filed within two years from the end of the relevant assessment year,” she said. With this proposal now, there will be a trust reposed in the taxpayers that will enable the assessee herself to declare the income that she may have missed out earlier while filing her return, she said. “It is an affirmative step in the direction of voluntary tax compliance,” she said. To bring parity between employees of State and Central government she has proposed to increase the tax deduction limit from 10% to 14% on employer’s contribution to the National Pension System (NPS) account of State Government employees as well. This would help in enhancing the social security benefits of the state government employees and bring them at par with central government employees. To establish a globally competitive business environment for certain domestic companies, a concessional tax regime of 15% tax was introduced by our government for newly incorporated domestic manufacturing companies. The FM has prosed to extend the last date for commencement of manufacturing or production under section 115BAB by one year i.e. from 31st March, 2023 to 31st March, 2024. The FM has proposed to cap the Surcharge on consortium of companies at 15% from a graded surcharge of 37% currently. She has also proposed to cap the surcharge on long term capital gains arising on transfer of any type of assets at 15% from graded surcharge of up to 37% currently. To track transactions involving businesses passing on benefits to their agents the budget has proposed to provide for tax deduction by the person giving benefits, if the aggregate value of such benefits exceeds ` 20,000 during the financial year. The budget has proposed to reduce Customs duty on cut and polished diamonds and gemstones to 5%. Simply sawn diamond would attract nil customs duty. To disincentivise import of undervalued imitation jewellery, the customs duty on imitation jewellery has been imposed. The minister proposed to reduce customs duty on methanol, acetic acid and heavy feed stocks for petroleum refining are being reduced, while duty is being raised on sodium cyanide for which adequate domestic capacity exists. ""These changes will help in enhancing domestic value addition,"" she said. To incentivise exports, exemptions are being provided on items such as embellishment, trimming, fasteners, buttons, zipper, lining material, specified leather, furniture fittings and packaging boxes that may be needed by bonafide exporters of handicrafts, textiles and leather garments, leather footwear and other goods. Duty is being reduced on certain inputs required for shrimp aquaculture so as to promote its exports. To encourage the efforts for blending of fuel, unblended fuel shall attract an additional differential excise duty of ` 2/ litre from the 1st day of October 2022. Divya Baweja, Partner, Deloitte India said the budget’s proposal to extend the benefit to long term capital gains arising on the sale of any other capital assets is a welcome move. On the two-year time for filing of returns he said, “This is an additional recourse available to the taxpayers who missed reporting their correct income in earlier returns, subject to the payment additional tax as prescribed. While these timelines are extended beyond the current provisions of filing the revised return, it is important to note that filing the updated return is likely to prove beneficial in case the updated return is filed within 12 months from the end of the assessment year rather than pushing it to a later date. This provision is a step in the direction to minimize the tax litigation thereby benefitting both the taxpayer and the revenue authorities”.",Lalatendu Mishra,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/union-budget-2022-no-change-in-personal-income-tax-rates-in-budget/article38358062.ece

Stating there had been a phenomenal increase in transactions in virtual digital assets, she said the magnitude and frequency of these transactions had made it imperative to provide for a specific tax regime. “Accordingly, for the taxation of virtual digital assets, I propose to provide that any income from transfer of any virtual digital asset shall be taxed at the rate of 30%,” she said. Ms. Sitharaman added there would be no deduction in respect of any expenditure nor any allowance allowed while computing such income except cost of acquisition. “Further, loss from transfer of virtual digital asset cannot be set off against any other income,” she said. Further, to capture the transaction details, she also proposed to provide for TDS on payment made in relation to transfer of virtual digital asset at the rate of 1% of such consideration above a monetary threshold.

The global average temperature has risen by around 1°C since pre-industrial times. This magnitude and rate of warming cannot be explained by natural variations alone and must necessarily take into account changes due to human activities. Emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), aerosols and changes in land use and land cover during the industrial period have substantially altered the atmospheric composition, and consequently the planetary energy balance, and are thus primarily responsible for the present day climate change,” he said in a written response to a question by Sougata Ray. At an average 33.1 degrees, the median maximum temperature of March was at an all-time high of about 1.8 degrees above normal when compared to the reference period of 1981-2010. Temperatures over 4-6°C the usual historical maximum were being experienced over many parts of the country and heatwave conditions also prevailed from March third week onwards, he noted. Meteorologists have said the immediate reasons for high temperatures were due the absence of rainfall and continuous dry and hot westerly winds blowing from Balochistan, central Pakistan and the Thar Desert over northwest and central India. The western disturbances that bring rain to India from West Asia, were also lacklustre. These conditions are expected to persist for most of April, particularly over northwest and central India. The annual mean land surface air temperature averaged over India in 2021 was 0.44 degree Celsius above the long period average (LPA) computed from 1981-2010. Year 2021 was the fifth warmest year since nationwide records commenced in 1901. Since 2013, the India Meteorological Department (IMD), in collaboration with local health departments, had started issuing heat action plan in many parts of the country to forewarn about heatwaves as well as advising action to be taken during such occasions. The National Disaster Management Agency and the IMD were working with 23 States prone to high temperatures leading to heatwave conditions to develop heat action plans, the Minister stated.",Jacob Koshy,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/global-warming-behind-record-march-temperatures-minister-informs-lok-sabha/article65296429.ece
746,"April 06, 2022",14:17 IST,sci-tech,science,Science for All | Advantages of aposematism," Mechanisms for defence against predators takes many forms. A common adaptation is camouflage, where the animal avoids being eaten by its predator by merging with the background, by adapting specific colouration or shape. The leaf insect acquires the shape and colour of a leaf. It even sways as it walks, to resemble the swaying of a leaf in the breeze. The dead leaf butterfly (Kallima inachus), when its wings are folded, looks like a dried leaf.  Sometimes, animals pursue the very opposite tactic to avoid being eaten by predators. Instead of merging into the background, they actually aggressively advertise themselves through colouration or shape that they are not worth eating. The brightly coloured animal could be toxic, taste bad, smell foul or have spines or just be too aggressive. Perceiving that there is no profit in eating them the prey leaves them alone.  This tactic is called aposematism and the animal which pursues this is aposematic. The word aposematic is derived from the Greek (‘apo’ standing for ‘away’, and ‘sematic’ standing for ‘sign’). Aposematism works best when members of the prey are located together in large numbers. A few members are eaten by the predator, who then realises that they are not worth eating and the rest are left alone. The most common colours are red, yellow, black and white. There are many examples of aposematics. Among these, the ladybird and the tiger moth are bitter to eat. The poison dart frog has poisonous glands which can cause pain and the skunk has a foul-smelling odour.  There are also animals that are not really poisonous or obnoxious in any other way, but sport bright colours that can cheat the predator into believing they are not good to eat: For example, the hornet moth which looks like the yellowjacket wasp. The predator is fooled into thinking that the moth will sting it and so it leaves the moth alone.  (If this newsletter was forwarded to you, you can subscribe to get it directly here.)

747,"April 06, 2022",10:30 IST,sci-tech,science,The Indian Antarctic Bill and its various provisions," The story so far: The Union government on Friday introduced the Indian Antarctic Bill, 2022, that aims to lay down a set of rules to regulate a range of activities on territories in Antarctica where India has set up research stations. Introduced by Union Science Minister, Jitendra Singh in the Lok Sabha, the Bill envisages regulating visits and activities to Antarctica as well as potential disputes that may arise among those present on the continent. It also prescribes penal provisions for certain serious violations. If the Bill were to become law, private tours and expeditions to Antarctica would be prohibited without a permit or the written authorisation by a member country. A member country is one of the 54 signatories of the Antarctic Treaty signed in 1959 — India joined the Treaty System in 1983. The Bill also lays out a structure for government officials to inspect a vessel and conduct checks of research facilities. The draft also directs the creation of a fund called the Antarctic fund that will be used for protecting the Antarctic environment. The Bill extends the jurisdiction of Indian courts to Antarctica and lays out penal provision for crimes on the continent by Indian citizens, foreign citizens who are a part of Indian expeditions, or are in the precincts of Indian research stations. Following its first expedition to Antarctica in 1982, India has now established two standing research stations, Bharati and Maitri, at Antarctica. Both these places are permanently manned by researchers. The Bill also establishes a ‘Committee on Antarctic Governance and Environmental Protection.’ The Bill prohibits mining, dredging and activities that threaten the pristine conditions of the continent. It bans any person, vessel or aircraft from disposing waste in Antarctica and bars the testing of nuclear devices. Mr. Singh remarked in Parliament that India had been a signatory to the Antarctic Treaty since 1983, which obliged it to specify a set of laws governing portions of the continent where it had its research bases. “Antarctica is a no man’s land...It isn’t that India is making a law for a territory that doesn’t belong to it….the question is in the territory involving India’s research stations, if some unlawful activity happens, how to check it? The Treaty made it mandatory for the 54 signatory countries to specify laws governing territories on which their stations are located. China has five, Russia has five, we have two,” said Mr. Singh. India is also signatory to treaties such as the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources and the the Protocol on the Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty— both of which enjoin India to help preserve the pristine nature of the continent. “There is growing concern over preserving the pristine Antarctic environment and ocean around Antarctica from exploitation of marine living resources and human presence in Antarctica... India organises regular Antarctic expeditions and many persons from India visit Antarctica every year as tourists. In the future, the private ship and aviation industry will also start operations and promote tourism and fishing in Antarctica, which needs to be regulated. The continuing and growing presence of Indian scientists in Antarctica warrants a domestic legislation on Antarctica consistent with its obligations as a member of the Antarctic Treaty. This is also in sync with the emergence of India as a global leader on important international fronts,” the text of the Bill notes. The Antarctic Treaty came into force on June 23, 1961 after ratification by the 12 countries then active in Antarctic science.  The Treaty covers the area south of 60°S latitude. Its key objectives are to demilitarise Antarctica, to establish it as a zone free of nuclear tests and the disposal of radioactive waste, and to ensure that it is used for peaceful purposes only; to promote international scientific cooperation in Antarctica and to set aside disputes over territorial sovereignty.  Of the 54 signatory countries, 29 have ‘consultative’ status that give them voting rights. The Treaty parties meet each year at the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting. They have adopted over 300 recommendations and negotiated separate international agreements. These, together with the original Treaty, provide the rules which govern activities in the Antarctic. Collectively they are known as the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS). India has organised 37 expeditions to Antarctica. The major thrust areas of the Indian Antarctic Programme are climate processes and links to climate change, environmental processes and conservation and polar technology. The operational expenditure of the Antarctic expedition is ₹90-110 crore annually depending on the projects and services.",Jacob Koshy,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/the-indian-antarctic-bill-and-its-various-provisions/article65293882.ece

The Hindu reached out to senior officials from the organisation for comment but did not receive any.  Social media was abuzz on Sunday with videos of a flaming meteor-like object that was sighted from terraces of people in Maharashtra. Space debris or remnants of satellites, rockets and other objects in space crashing into earth are a common occurrence but it is relatively rare for such objects to fall onto land.  Reports from facilities that track the path of such objects suggested that it was a re-entry of a Chinese rocket stage, the third stage of the Chang Zheng 3B serial number Y77 which was launched in Feb 2021. There has, however, neither been confirmation from Chinese authorities nor Indian officials on the provenance of these space objects. The growing number of satellites and space launches means space, in the vicinity of earth, is crowded with space objects. While there are international initiatives to track such debris, the ISRO has a Directorate of Space Situational Awareness and Management (DSSAM) which has been established at ISRO, in Bengaluru. One of its mandates is to track the trajectory of space objects. NEtwork for space object TRacking and Analysis (NETRA) project, ISRO has said, is initiated as a first step towards meeting this goal, its main elements being a radar, an optical telescope facility, and a control centre.",Jacob Koshy,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/isro-to-send-team-to-investigate-objects-that-fell-from-sky-in-maharashtra/article65293302.ece

751,"April 02, 2022",20:10 IST,sci-tech,science,What is the evidence that Earth formed inside a solar nebula?," Helium-3 has been measured at Earth's surface in relatively small quantities. But scientists did not know how much was leaking from the Earth's core, as opposed to its middle layers, called the mantle. The new study ( Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems) pins down the core as a major source of helium-3 for the Earth. Some natural processes can generate helium-3, such as the radioactive decay of tritium, but helium-3 is made primarily in solar nebulae — massive, spinning clouds of gas and dust like the one that gave rise to our Solar System. Because helium is one of the earliest elements produced in the universe, most helium-3 can be traced back to the Big Bang. As a planet grows, it accumulates material from its surroundings, so its composition reflects the environment in which it formed. To get high concentrations of helium-3 deep in the core, Earth would have had to form inside a thriving solar nebula, not on its fringes or during its waning phase. The new research adds further clues to the mystery surrounding Earth's formation, lending additional evidence to the theory that our planet formed inside the solar nebula. About 2,000 grams of helium-3 leak out of the Earth every year. Using the modern helium-3 leak rate along with models of helium isotope behavior, the researchers estimated there are between 10 teragrams (1013 grams) to a petagram (1015 grams) of helium-3 in the core — a vast quantity that points to Earth's formation inside the solar nebula, where high concentrations of the gas would have allowed it to build up deep in the planet.",Rimjhim Singh _11593,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/what-is-the-evidence-that-earth-formed-inside-a-solar-nebula/article65281514.ece
752,"April 02, 2022",20:05 IST,sci-tech,science,"Evolution can happen at shorter timescales, a fruit fly study shows"," Have we grossly underestimated the pace of evolution? That was a question that we sought to answer with our 2014 study on dynamic adaptation in fruit flies. The premise was that if adaptive tracking did occur in populations experiencing rapid environmental change, it would alter our understanding of the importance of evolutionary change for ecological outcomes.  Thus began a large-scale research initiative spread over eight years by evolutionary biologists across three universities — Stanford University, the University of Pennsylvania and Ahmedabad University. The results of the study — direct observation of adaptive tracking on ecological timescales — in Drosophila was published in the journal Science. The study has vastly changed our understanding of evolution and questioned the old notion of evolution being a slow process occurring over a longer period of time. We now have evidence that the change is actually happening faster than we ever thought and that not all evolution happens due to habitat destruction, invasion or pollution. It establishes that evolutionary changes happen quickly and researchers can track these in real time — within a single seasonal turn in a year. It’s that rapid. Taking fruit flies ( Drosophila melanogaster) as the sample, we began a large-scale controlled field experiment in Pennsylvania for four months from July-November 2014. What we did was directly measure phenotypic and genomic evolution in response to natural seasonal change across 10 independent replicate field populations (mesocosms), each comprising up to 1,00,000 fruit flies. This study was vastly different from the ones done earlier to track adaptive changes in shorter time spans.  The population size and replication in our study were the distinguishing factors. We conducted a large-scale research to ensure accuracy of results. Replication was also of utmost importance to establish our premise. Which is why not only was our sample size large but we also had 10 replicate cages (mesocosms), each of which gave comparable results. In these mesocosm cages, the fruit flies experienced the same seasonal changes — heat, rain, cold, they had the same food, and were exposed to the same predatory conditions. Changes were then observed in six phenotypes related to reproductive output or stress tolerance. We sampled individuals from the original population, and 2,500 eggs from each cage at the first four time points of observation. The genomes were sequenced to measure genomic change over time.  Population dynamics were largely consistent among the replicates — population size increased sharply during summer, peaked in early fall and then declined steadily as minimum daily temperatures reduced in late fall. Egg production showed a similar pattern while overall egg to adult growth was low. Comparable outcomes were seen in fruit flies kept in the replicate cages too. Eminent evolutionary biologists Professor Ary A. Hoffmann from Melbourne University, Australia, and Professor Thomas Flatt from University of Fribourg, Switzerland, wrote a perspective piece in the same issue of Science about this study. They appreciated the large study and gave a historical perspective around this long-standing problem in evolutionary biology. A study as large as this has manifold outcomes. Firstly, in understanding the field life of fruit flies a little more which will have a large impact on our basic understanding of evolution. We hope to see parallel reports in other taxa over the years (that is, observable evolutionary changes in ecological time scales).

753,"April 02, 2022",19:57 IST,sci-tech,science,Prehistoric relics point to riverine settlement at Attappady," The discovery of several prehistoric artefacts and archaeological remains along the banks of three rivers flowing through the Attappady hills straddling Kerala and Tamil Nadu, indicating the presence of a mature settlement, has surprised researchers and local people alike.  The discovery of several stone tools, inhabited caves, menhirs, cists or burial chambers, stone circles, burial urns, black and red ware pottery, terracotta images, stone carvings, and granite inscriptions points to prehistoric human settlements in the predominantly tribal area of Attappady. The archaeological discoveries were made from different places along the banks of the rivers Bhavani, Siruvani, and Kodumkara Pallam or Anakkatti recently. The remains came to light during an extensive post-doctoral study undertaken by economist A.D. Manikandan among the tribal communities of Attappady. However, over the years, many of the prehistoric artefacts have been destroyed and damaged by the local people, unaware of the region’s ancient past. Although there were dozens of granite menhirs, some up to 20 feet tall, only a few remain intact. Tellingly, one of the tribal settlements at Kottathara is called Nattakkallu Ooru (meaning a hamlet of menhirs), where all but one 11-ft menhir have been destroyed. “No one bothered to go back into the history of Attappady. What amazes me is that this tribal land known only for its penury, sufferings, exploitation and land-grabbing has had a marvelous civilization to boast of. Interestingly, innumerable relics were found from both sides of the rivers flowing through Attappady,” said Dr. Manikandan, whose two-volume book on the pre-historic life and culture of Attappady is set to be published shortly. This reporter found cist burial sites and shards of black and red pottery widely scattered on both sides of Kodumkara Pallam. The river marks the border between Kerala and Tamil Nadu with Attappady on the western bank. Black and red polished earthen ware with different patterns were also discovered in recent weeks from a private land at Anakkatti in Sholayur grama panchayat. “We were surprised by the findings. We want the Archaeology department to study it,” Sholayur panchayat president P. Ramamoorthy told The Hindu. A team of researchers led by P.V. Mohammed Kutty has approached the Indian Institute of Geomagnetism, Mumbai, and the Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences, Lucknow, for radiocarbon dating of the relics. “We can’t just blindly reach an assumption without scientific studies. We can only say for sure now is that Attappady is a treasure trove of culture and civilization,” said Dr. Mohammed Kutty.",Abdul Latheef Naha,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/prehistoric-relics-reveal-attappadys-ancient-past/article65282602.ece
754,"April 02, 2022",19:55 IST,sci-tech,science,"Too early to do away with face masks, but onus on public: experts","  Even though some States have decided to stop penalising people for not wearing masks as COVID-19 cases continue to drop, healthcare experts are of the opinion that it is too early to completely do away with the restriction. They have advised people to voluntarily mask up in order to also stay protected from infections such as influenza and swine-flu, apart from coronavirus. The Maharashtra and Delhi governments recently decided to ease the restriction on the compulsory wearing of face masks in public, a norm that was in place for two years and its violation attracted a fine of ₹2,000. Reacting to the development, renowned virologist T Jacob John said since the pandemic is ""over"" in India, the use of mask is no longer needed to reduce the SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The mask mandate has lived its time and there is no justification for its continuation as a ""mandate"". But it is a good idea to promote the voluntary wearing of masks in public places to reduce inhalation of dust and other respiratory transmitted agents, including TB bacilli, flu virus, other respiratory viruses like syncytial virus, adenovirus, common cold etc, he said. ""It is a habit that will reduce diseases. Currently, we see kidney transplant patients wearing masks; everyone will benefit — in buses, trains, aeroplanes etc,"" John, the former director of the Indian Council for Medical Research Centre of Advanced Research in Virology, told PTI. ""My personal opinion is that there ought to be an active promotion of mask-wearing in all hospital premises, in outpatient clinics, queues and waiting areas. There, I am not averse to even a mandate. For staff and patients, relatives, visitors etc,"" John added. Dr. Ravi Shekhar Jha, Additional Director and Head of the Department, Pulmonology, Fortis Escorts Hospital, Faridabad, said masks should continue to be mandatory and it is premature to give up this habit completely. ""The disastrous second wave, that took many young lives across the world, was something that the modern world had not seen before. People had become a little complacent after the first wave and that probably lead to an unchecked rise in fatal cases. Though it is true that majority of susceptible Indians are vaccinated, what we must keep in mind is that the vaccine doesn't protect us against infection. Even if the infection is not fatal, it keeps you weak for many months,"" he said. ""We all know about the long COVID. Therefore, it is best to not get infected. So far, science has proved that masks are the only major contributors to preventing infection,"" Jha told PTI. Another important consideration here is that though COVID-19 has probably weakened, the country saw a reduction in the number of swine flu cases due to masks and sanitation practices. ""Swine flu is more fatal than COVID and the combination called flurona can also be prevented by this. Therefore, in my opinion, masks must not be taken out of fashion...too early,"" he noted. Dr. Akshay Budhraja, senior pulmonologist, Aakash Healthcare Super Speciality Hospital, said it is time to stop swinging between restriction and normalcy. We must learn to live with coronavirus like the same way we live with other viruses such as influenza and adenovirus among others. ""Masks should not be mandatory for the general population, but recommended for those who are sick or who may have any kind of immunosuppressive illness, those visiting crowded closed places with poor ventilation or when visiting a healthcare facility like a hospital or a clinic,"" he said. ""At the same time, we need to stay cautious and follow the latest recommendations which may change from time to time in the coming months, as per the statistics. Now that everyone is aware on when to wear a mask, we must take responsibility ourselves in coming times,” he added. Dr. Arunesh Kumar, HOD and senior consultant, Pulmonology, Paras Hospitals, Gurugram, said there has been a rise in COVID-19 cases in West as well as in China. ""Masking is the second-most effective intervention after vaccination when it comes to preventing new COVID-19 infection. We are still not there with our double vaccine recipient numbers, where herd immunity will be attained. New infections invite virus mutation. With a population as large as ours, it may prove a costly move as people will definitely find a reason not to put a mask on as a major deterrent has been removed,"" he said. Advocating for unlocking but not unmasking, Dr. Kumar said, “I urge people to consider masking up on a voluntary basis when out and about to help the country fight COVID infection effectively.”",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/too-early-to-do-away-with-face-masks-but-onus-on-public-experts/article65284228.ece
755,"April 02, 2022",19:50 IST,sci-tech,science,How male fruit flies learn the rules of courtship," Fruit flies that grow in a set up where there is a predominance of males over females inherently understand which females will accept their sexual overtures, according to a new study published online in the journal Animal Behaviour. Sexual behaviour can be inherited as well as learnt, this is the slant of the study, which was led by researchers from Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Mohali. When male fruit flies approach females to mate with, they spend time in a courtship — which includes following and circling the female, producing a song using wing vibrations, licking or attempting to mount the female, etc. The females respond either positively or negatively. A typical rejection reaction can involve a ‘wing flick’ to indicate they are not interested. “Most of the time, the female just moves away,” explains Nagaraj Guru Prasad, from the Department of Biological Sciences at IISER, Mohali, who led the study. On average a male fruit fly spends between a few tens of seconds to a minute on a female before giving up. After doing this many times, the flies get to recognise which females would have them and which would reject them. Then they save time by wooing only those females that would accept their overtures. The question the researchers ask is how would this learning capacity change when there is a selection pressure on them? Namely, if the flies were placed in an environment with an excess of male flies over female flies, they would experience a selection pressure. This is because when there are many males and few available females, there is higher competition between the males and this would effectively affect their chances of passing on their genes to their progeny. Thereby, the males most adept in finding acquiescent females will be selected over those who do not. In the experiment, fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) were raised in two types of surroundings: One in which there was an excess of males, such that the male-female ratio was 3:1, and another in which the ratio of males to females was 1:3. This was ensured as follows: “Every generation, flies from every population are collected within 6 hours of coming out of the puparium. This ensures that they are virgins. They are then combined in the required sex ratios,” says Dr. Prasad. This means that every second week, people have to be up through the night for one week to collect flies as virgins. “This has been done every second week for the last 12 years,” he says. The populations were thus selected for over 250 generations. In these populations, sexual selection is always present; however, the degree varies. Dr. Prasad explains this, “We achieve this by varying the operational sex ratio and using male-biased and female-biased populations. We wanted to know – if the degree of sexual selection varies, does it affect learning ability?” The results were surprising. They tested male flies from both groups – with high selection pressure and low selection pressure – by training them with females who were receptive and those who were not. They found that there was little difference in the ability to learn to discern between the two types of response from females. However, the flies that were brought up in a high-selection pressure environment – with higher number of males as compared to females – inherently had the ability to make this discrimination. That is, even when they were not trained to discriminate between willing and unwilling females by being shown both types of responses, they could make out the difference. Thus, the learning had been coded into their genes. “Taken together, these results show that sexual selection may not result in improved learning abilities but can lead to the evolution of an improved innate ability of males to assess the receptivity of females,” says Dr. Prasad. In the larger context, this shows that certain abilities that are otherwise “learnt” can be made “innate” by selection. Dr Prasad, adds a note of caution, “However, this carries a cost and therefore evolves only when the benefits outweigh the costs.” Next the group is trying to generalise the result. “We have looked at learning in the courtship context. However, learning and cognitive abilities extend beyond that- learning of various other types. We are trying to see if our results are generalisable to all types of learning and cognition,” he says.",Shubashree Desikan,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/how-male-fruit-flies-learn-the-rules-of-courtship/article65282812.ece
756,"April 02, 2022",19:45 IST,sci-tech,science,Immunity following infection lasts up to 19 months," A retrospective study undertaken in Sweden has once again found irrefutable evidence in support of vaccination even among people who have been previously infected. The study also found that people who have been infected and subsequently vaccinated with one or two doses of a vaccine, which is called hybrid immunity, had far greater protection from infection and hospitalisation. At the same time, natural immunity from previous infection alone without additional protection from vaccination was associated with low risk of hospitalisation for up to 19 months. The results were published on March 31 in the journal  The Lancet Infectious Diseases. The study was undertaken between March 20, 2020 and October 4, 2021 for documented infections by the virus and between March 30, 2020 and September 5, 2021 for hospitalisation. The study looked at three cohorts — people who have been infected but not vaccinated (20,39,106), people who have been infected and received one dose of the vaccine (29,62,318), and people with previous infection and have been fully vaccinated with two doses (35,67,810). The study found that three months after infection, natural immunity was associated with 95% lower risk of reinfection and 87% lower risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation compared with people who have not been previously infected and hence have no immunity. The lower risk from reinfection and hospitalisation in people with previous infection compared with infection-naïve people lasted for up to 19 months. “Natural immunity was associated with increased risk during the first three months of follow-up, but from three months onwards, there was an associated 87% lower risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation in people with natural immunity than in people with no immunity for up to 19 months of follow-up. The associations were weaker with increasing age,” they write. Several studies have already shown reduced risk of reinfection and hospitalisation in people who have been previously infected. A meta-analysis of 15 cohort studies also found that immunity acquired through natural infection was associated with 87% reduced risk of reinfection for up to one year.  In the second cohort that was previously infected and had received one dose of the vaccine, the study found only 639 people had a case of reinfection compared with 1,662 people with just natural immunity. The hybrid immunity was thus associated with a 58% reduced risk of reinfection, which was reduced to 45% from two months onwards. The associations were weaker in older individuals and in people who had comorbidities. In people with hybrid immunity with one dose of the vaccine, there were just eight hospitalisations compared with 113 in people with only natural immunity from previous infection. Thus, hybrid immunity from one dose provided an additional 94% lower risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation compared with people with just natural immunity. The association of lower risk of reinfection in people with hybrid immunity from one dose was seen for up to two months and a gradual reduction till nine months. In the third cohort that was previously infected people who had received two doses of the vaccine, the hybrid immunity was associated with a 69% lower risk of reinfection than in people who have only natural immunity during the first two months of follow-up; this reduced to 56% after two months but no further reduction in protection was seen up to nine months. Like in other cohorts, the association was weaker in older people and in those who had comorbidities. Hybrid immunity after two doses was also associated with an additional 90% lower risk of hospitalisation. “The number of individuals with natural immunity needed to be double vaccinated to prevent one reinfection during follow-up was 767,” they write. Coming to the significance of the study, the authors note that in many countries, people with previous infection have been required to be fully vaccinated and even take a booster shot. This was mainly because the level of protection and duration of protection offered by natural immunity was not known beyond one year. “Our study extends the body of evidence with up to 20 months of follow-up and more than 1,30,000 documented SARS-CoV-2 infections, and our results showed that individuals with natural immunity had an associated 95% protection against SARS-CoV-2 reinfection during follow-up (from three months after initial infection until 20 months), with no signs of waning,” they write. “These results indicate that natural immunity might be better maintained than immunity induced by vaccination only, as suggested also by preliminary data from an Israeli study.” Another significant outcome of this study was that people who were previously infected had an increased risk of hospitalisation during the first three months after infection. But once past this stage, the natural immunity in those previously infected was associated with 87% protection against hospitalisation. “The associated level of protection remained high (78%) even from nine up to 19 months of follow-up, altogether indicating long-lasting protection, including against severe disease, from natural immunity,” they write.",R.

757,"March 31, 2022",14:46 IST,sci-tech,science,Explained | Can the dodo be brought back to life?," “Can we bring animals back from extinction?” In a panel discussion on this topic organised recently by the Royal Society, evolutionary biologist Beth Shapiro mentioned that if there were an animal she would like to bring back from extinction, it was the dodo. This follows on the fact that researchers at her lab at the University of California, Santa Cruz have succeeded in isolating the entire genome of the dodo.  The dodo is a bird that lived in the Mauritius region and was last spotted 350 years back, in 1662. Since then it has become extinct. It would not be exaggerating to say that it is the very symbol of extinction. The phrase “dead as a dodo” is common in English to refer to something totally dead. The form of the bird has been revived from old drawings and the closest resemblance is in an Indian Mughal painting rediscovered in the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg. In the painting it is slimmer and browner than in other descriptions. It is believed to be a more accurate depiction because it is pictured along with other birds which can be easily identified. The painting is by Mughal painter Ustad Mansur, probably commissioned by Emperor Jahangir who was famous for getting flora and fauna documented in paintings. So, bringing the dodo alive would be the ultimate story of de-extinction. A species endemic to the island of Mauritius, the dodo is believed to be about 1 metre tall, flightless and weighed between 10 and 18 kilograms. Its real appearance is known only from paintings and drawings which vary a lot. Beth Shapiro’s lab has sequenced the complete genome of the dodo, in work that is as yet unpublished, and she says that the closest living relative of the dodo is the Nicobar pigeon. You need a specimen of the animal that has not been fossilized over the ages. Icy places like permafrost may contain remains of living beings in such a preserved form. A small piece about the size of a finger-nail is taken from these specimens, and broken into small pieces. In an absolutely uncontaminated state, this is added to a PCR kit which multiplies the genome and makes many, many copies. From these fragments, the entire genome is pieced together, comparing it to genomes of other, living close relatives. First the researchers in Shapiro’s team tried to do this from a piece taken from a specimen at Oxford. But it was not nearly large enough. Later they found a specimen in Denmark from which they were able to sequence the entire Genome. Beth Shapiro explained in the discussion that the known way of doing this would be to first stick in parts of the extinct animal’s genome into a framework provided by its close relative. For example, by inserting the mammoth genome into the elephant’s and construct a cell that contained sufficient amount of mammoth genome in it and then to clone it like Dolly the sheep. But while this process has been somewhat understood in the case of mammals, a new process has to be worked out for birds. “There are different groups that are working on this, and I have no doubt that we’ll get there, but this is a hurdle we face with birds,” she said.",Shubashree Desikan,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/explained-can-the-dodo-be-brought-back-to-life/article65255128.ece
758,"March 30, 2022",17:31 IST,sci-tech,science,Science for All | What is M2e?," This article forms a part of the Science for All newsletter that takes the jargon out of science and puts the fun in! Subscribe now! The M2 protein is considered to be a holy grail of designing a universal flu vaccine. The seasonal influenza strains mutate rapidly and new strains of the virus proliferate. This makes it very difficult to make a vaccine that can consistently generate a sufficient degree of immunity. The M2e peptide is a section of the influenza virus that is conserved, meaning it doesn’t undergo too many mutations. Researchers have observed through the years that the M2e peptide region is pretty much unchanged across the several kinds of influenza A strains. Therefore, it is possible to design a vaccine that targets this peptide and prime the immune system to generate antibodies. For this reason, M2e has for years been seen as a leading universal flu candidate. However, it has a limited ability to trigger a strong and long-lasting immune response and this has represented a major roadblock in its clinical development. Recently researchers have reported a novel vaccine platform to deliver M2e to immune cells. By deploying this platform, a single shot vaccine containing M2e was able to trigger long-lasting immune responses that could protect effectively against multiple strains of the flu. The team was also able to demonstrate that this vaccination approach significantly enhanced protective immune responses in the context of pre-existing flu immunity-- a situation particularly relevant in adult and elderly populations, where individuals have been exposed to flu viruses multiple times in the past and have low levels of M2e-specific antibodies in their blood circulation. This vaccine approach has the potential to minimise the amount of M2e vaccine antigen (substance that triggers the body’s immune response against that itself) and the need for strong adjuvants (a substance which enhances the body’s immune response to an antigen), reducing potential side-effects, particularly in more vulnerable populations.

759,"March 29, 2022",10:30 IST,sci-tech,science,Detecting microplastics in human blood," The story so far: Microplastics are, as the name suggests, tiny particles of plastics found in various places — the oceans, the environment, and now in human blood. A study by researchers from The Netherlands (Heather A. Leslie et al, Environment International, Published online 24 March) has examined blood samples of 22 persons, all anonymous donors and healthy adults, and found plastic particles in 17 of them. A report on this work, published in The Guardian conveys that about half of these were PET (polyethylene tertraphthalate) plastics, which is used to make food grade bottles. The size of the particles that the group looked for was as small as about 700 nanometres (equal to 0.0007 millimetres). This is really small and it remains to be seen if there is a danger of such particles crossing the blood cell walls and affecting the organs. Also, a larger study needs to be conducted to firm up the present findings. Microplastics are tiny bits of various types of plastic found in the environment. The name is used to differentiate them from “macroplastics” such as bottles and bags made of plastic. There is no universal agreement on the size that fits this bill — the U.S. NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) and the European Chemical Agency define microplastic as less than 5mm in length. However, for the purposes of this study, since the authors were interested in measuring the quantities of plastic that can cross the membranes and diffuse into the body via the blood stream, the authors have an upper limit on the size of the particles as 0.0007 millimetre. The study looked at the most commonly used plastic polymers. These were polyethylene tetraphthalate (PET), polyethylene (used in making plastic carry bags), polymers of styrene (used in food packaging), poly (methyl methylacrylate) and poly propylene. They found a presence of the first four types.  In the study, blood from 22 adult healthy volunteers was collected anonymously, stored in vessels protected from contamination, and then analysed for its plastic content. The size of the bore in the needle served to filter out microplastics of a size greater than desired. This was compared against suitable blanks to rule out pre-existing plastic presence in the background. The study found that 77% of tested people (17 of the 22 persons) carried various amounts of microplastics above the limit of quantification. In 50% of the samples, the researchers detected PET particles. In 36%, they found presence of polystyrene. 23% of polyethylene and 5% of poly(methyl methylacrylate) were also found. However, traces of poly propylene were not detected. They found in each donor, on average, 1.6 microgram of plastic particles per milli litre of blood sample. They write in the paper that this can be interpreted as an estimate of what to expect in future studies. It is a helpful starting point for further development of analytical studies for human matrices research. Making a human health risk assessment in relation to plastic particles is not easy, perhaps not even possible, due to the lack of data on exposure of people to plastics. In this sense, it is important to have studies like this one. The authors of the paper also remark that validated methods to detect the tiny (trace) amounts of extremely small-sized (less than 10 micrometre) plastic particles are lacking. Hence this study, which builds up a methods to check the same, is important. Owing to the small size of the participants, the study results cannot be taken as such to mould policy etc, but the power of this paper is in the method and in demonstrating that such a possibility of finding microplastics in the blood exists. It is not yet clear if these microplastics can cross over from the blood stream to deposit in organs and cause diseases. The authors point out that the human placenta has shown to be permeable to tiny particles of polystyrene ( 50, 80 and 24 nanometre beads). Experiments on rats where its lungs were exposed to polystryrene spheres (20 nanometre) led to translocation of the nanoparticles to the placental and foetal tissue. Oral administration of microplastics in rats led to accumulation of these in the liver, kidney and gut.  Further studies have to be carried out to really assess the impact of plastics on humans.",Shubashree Desikan,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/detecting-microplastics-in-human-blood/article65267369.ece

761,"March 27, 2022",20:07 IST,sci-tech,science,"India’s ‘space economy’ valued at ₹36,794 crore"," A collaboration between two premier research and educational institutions in Thiruvananthapuram has shed interesting light on India’s “space economy”, the exact contours of which have remained largely vague even as the country’s space programme grew by leaps and bounds.  In a first-of-its kind attempt at measuring the size of India's space economy, researchers from the Centre for Development Studies (CDS) and the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST) arrived at a figure of ₹36,794 crore (approximately $5 billion) for the 2020-21 fiscal. The estimated size of India's space economy, as a percentage of the GDP, has slipped from 0.26% in 2011-12 to 0.19% in 2020-21, they found.  The findings, outlined in a paper 'The Space Economy of India: Its Size and Structure' by CDS director Sunil Mani; V. K. Dadhwal, till recently Director of IIST; and Shaijumon C. S., Associate Professor of Economics, IIST, were the subject of a webinar on Saturday.  By employing internationally-accepted frameworks, the authors have examined the annual budget for the space programme and its constituents; space manufacturing, operations and application. According to the paper, space applications accounted for the major chunk of this evolving economy, constituting 73.57% (₹ 27061 crore) of it in 2020-21, followed by space operations (₹ 8218.82 crore or 22.31%) and manufacturing (₹ 1515.59 crore or 4.12%).  The budget outlay for space has considerable influence on the dynamics of the space economy, according to the study. ''India's space economy has evolved considerably and now accounts, on an average, for about 0.23% of the GDP (over 2011-12 to 2020-21). We have also noticed a decline in the budget for space-related activities, leading to a reduction in the size of the economy in the last two years,'' prof. Mani said. The budget outlay in 2020-21 was ₹9,500 crore, shrinking from ₹13,033.2 crore in the previous fiscal. The estimated size of the space economy shrunk from ₹43,397 crore in 2018-19 to ₹39,802 crore in 2019-20 and ₹36,794 crore in 2020-21.  The study also found that the space budget as a percentage of the GDP slipped from 0.09% in 2000-01 to 0.05% in 2011-12, and has remained more or less at that level since then. In relation to GDP, India's spending is more than that of China, Germany, Italy and Japan, but less than the U.S. and Russia.  While it has limitations, the study nevertheless is a first-time attempt at scientifically measuring the size of the space economy, Dr. Shaijumon said. Prof. Mani cited the inability to establish the size of the space-based remote sensing industry as a drawback. ''The next step for us would be to look at the impact of space economy on the Indian economy itself. The impact is both direct and indirect,'' Prof. Mani said.

762,"March 26, 2022",19:20 IST,sci-tech,science,Wreck of only sunken Gulf whaler discovered 190 years later," A whaling ship from Massachusetts sank near the mouth of the Mississippi River about 15 years before Herman Melville introduced the world to Moby Dick. Nearly 190 years later, experts said, it was still the only whaler known to have gone down in the Gulf of Mexico, where the threat of enslavement at Southern ports posed a risk for Black and mixed-race men who often were part of whaling crews. Researchers, checking out odd shapes during undersea scanning work on the sandy ocean floor, believed they had finally found the shipwreck about 113 kilometres offshore Pascagoula in Mississippi. It was documented in February by remotely operated robots in about 1,829 metres of water. Not much is left of the two-masted wooden brig thought to be Industry, a 65-foot-long (20-metre-long) whaler that foundered after a storm in 1836. An old news clipping found in a library showed its 15 or so crew members were rescued by another whaling ship and were returned home to Westport in Massachusetts, said researcher Jim Delgado of SEARCH Inc. The discovery of Industry shows how whaling extended into a region where relatively little was known about whaling, despite the Gulf's extensive maritime history. “The Gulf is an undersea museum of some incredibly well-preserved wrecks,” said Delgado of SEARCH Inc., who a few years ago helped identify the remains of the last known US slave ship, the Clotilda, in muddy river waters just north of Mobile in Alabama. The find also sheds light on the way race and slavery became entangled in the nation's maritime economy, said historian Lee Blake, a descendant of Paul Cuffe, a prominent Black whaling captain who made at least two trips aboard the Industry. Southern slave owners felt threatened by mixed-race ship crews coming into port, she said, so they tried to prevent enslaved people from seeing Whites, Blacks, Native Americans and others, all free and working together for equal pay. “There were a whole series of regulations and laws so that if a crew came into a Southern port and there were a large number of mixed-raced or African American crew members on board, the ship was impounded and the crew members were taken into custody until it left,” said Blake, president of the New Bedford Historical Society in Massachusetts. Black crew members also could be abducted and enslaved, she said. Images of Industry captured by NOAA Ocean Exploration aboard the research ship Okeanos Explorer show the outline of a ship along with anchors and metal and brick remnants of a stove-like contraption used to render oil from whale blubber at sea, elements Delgado described as key evidence that the wreck was a whaling vessel. The Industry photos pale in comparison to those recently released of Endurance, which sank in 3,048 metres of frigid Antarctic water a century ago and is incredibly well preserved. Bottles believed to date to the early 1800s are visible around Industry, but no ship's nameplate; what appears to be modern fishing line lies near the metal tryworks used to produce oil from whale fat. The Gulf was a rich hunting ground for sperm whales, which were especially valuable for the amount and quality of their oil, before the nation's whaling industry collapsed in the late 19th century, said Judith Lund, a whaling historian and former curator at the New Bedford Whaling Museum in Massachusetts. “In the 1790s, there were more whales than they could pluck out of the Gulf of Mexico,” she said in an interview. While at least 214 whaling voyages ventured into the Gulf, Lund said, ships from the Northeast rarely made extended port calls in Southern cities like New Orleans or Mobile, Alabama, because of the threat to crew members who weren't white. That may have been a reason the whaling ship that rescued Industry's crew took the men back to Massachusetts, where slavery was outlawed in the 1780s, rather than landing in the South. ""The people who whaled in the Gulf of Mexico knew it was risky to go into those ports down there because they had mixed crews,"" said Lund.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/wreck-of-only-sunken-gulf-whaler-discovered-190-years-later/article65262018.ece
763,"March 26, 2022",19:20 IST,sci-tech,science,Smoking causes over seven million deaths a year," As per the estimates of WHO (and the FDA of the US) 1.3 billion people (among the 7.9 billion across the world) who smoke, and 80% of them live in low and middle- income countries. Smoking is thus an epidemic and a great public health threat, killing over eight million people around the year. Over seven million of these people die due to direct tobacco use, and 1.2 million non-smokers who are exposed to second-hand smoke. And, as per the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, traditional cigarette smokers are 30% to 40% more likely than non-smokers to develop Type 2 diabetes. A recent article by Dr. Smiljanic Stasha points out that 1) smoking causes over seven million deaths every year, 2) 5.6 million young Americans might die because of smoking 3) Second hand smoking causes 1.2 million deaths worldwide 4) Smoking is one of the world’s leading causes of impoverishment, and 5) In 2015, 7 out of 10 smokers (68%) reported that they wanted to quit completely. And a recent issue of Nature Medicine points out that after the WHO adopted the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in 2003, it has been included as a Global Development Target in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (SD). If all the 155 signatory countries adopt smoking bans, health warnings, advertising bans and raise cigarette costs, this sustainable development is indeed possible. India has graduated from a low-income country into a developed country, and is estimated to have 120 million smokers (out of a population of 138 crores), or about 9% of Indian people. A material called Cannabis was prevalent in India and neighbouring countries. Cannabis is a plant product that was (and still is) known by the local names marijuana, charas, hashish, ganja, and bhang. The user feels ‘high’ upon consuming (smoking) it. The active principle in Cannabis is a psychoactive molecule called tetrahydrocannabinol, which is responsible for its psychoactive and intoxicating effects. Even today, during the annual Holi festival, people in India smoke ganja or bhang, to feel “high”. Turning to tobacco, its origin, use as a medicinal, ceremonial and intoxicant are extensively described by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research’s (ICAR) Central Tobacco Research Institute at Rajahmundry, Andhra Pradesh. The tobacco plant appears to have been cultivated in the Peruvian/Ecuadorean Andes in South America. The Spanish word for these intoxicating plants was ‘Tobacco’.  It appears that the Portuguese explorer Christopher Columbus, during his voyage to the Americas found the natives would sniff powdered these dry tobacco leaves through their noses and enjoyed it. In order to do so, they would use a hollow forked cane. Columbus did so too, enjoyed it and carried it over to Europe. The ‘pipe’ used by the Europeans for enjoying tobacco appears to have its origin from the forked cane of the Red Indians. It was Columbus who introduced tobacco to Europe, and their colonies in India and South Asia. The Portuguese introduced tobacco cultivation in the north western districts of Gujarat, and the British colonials did the same in U. P., Bihar and Bengal.  The Imperial Agricultural Research Institute was established in 1903, and began research on the botanical and genetic studies of tobacco. In effect, then, tobacco plant and its intoxicating effects were not known to India until it was brought and cultivated by the westerners. The active principle in tobacco is the molecule nicotine. It is named after Jean Nicot, who was a French Ambassador in Portugal. He sent tobacco seeds from Brazil to Paris in 1560. Nicotine was isolated from tobacco plants in 1858 by W. H. Posselt and K. L. Reimann of Germany, who believed it to be a poison, and that it is highly addictive unless it is used in slow-release form. (Is this why filter cigarettes are used- to bring the release slower?)  Louis Melsens described its chemical empirical formula in 1843, and its molecular structure was described by Adolf Pinner and Richard Wolffenstein in 1893. And it was first synthesized by Auguste Pictet and Crepieux in 1904. Recent research has also shown that regular smokers are prone to Type 2 diabetes. India has about 12 crores of people who smoke. This needs to be drastically reduced, in light of public health. The Indian Ministry of Health is set to prohibit the sale of cigarettes. India has become a party to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control on February 27, 2005.  In accordance with this Framework and SD Goals, our Health Ministry has completely banned smoking in many public places and workplaces such as in healthcare, educational and government facilities, and in public transport. These are welcome moves and we the public must cooperate with them. (dbala@lvpei.org)",D.

764,"March 26, 2022",19:15 IST,sci-tech,science,How mitochondria adapted to living within cells," An organism that has been around from 2 billion years ago has given biologists from Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad (CCMB), a clue as to how mitochondria became an inseparable part of animal and plant cells. The researchers, led by Rajan Sankaranarayanan, identify two key transformations, one in the molecule known as DTD for short and another in the transfer-RNA (tRNA). “Our lab works on a molecule called D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase (DTD). We observed some unexpected biochemistry of eukaryotic DTD that could be explained based on endosymbiotic origin of complex eukaryotic cell organelles.” Endosymbiosis is an intense form of symbiosis when one of the organisms is captured and internalized by the other. Today, mitochondria are well known to be integral parts of the eukaryotic cell. They are dubbed the power houses of the cell, because they help in generating energy in the form of ATP within the cell, powering it. But they were not always part of the animal and plant cells. Once, about two billion years ago, a prokaryotic organism (without a nucleus) called archaea captured a bacterial cell. The bacterial cell learnt to live within the archaea as an endosymbiont. How this happened has been an important question among biologists. “In the late 19th century, microscopists observed that organelles like chloroplast [and later mitochondria] undergo division inside eukaryotic cells that resembles bacterial division, which led them to suspect that these organelles might have arisen from bacterial endosymbionts,” say Jotin Gogoi and Akshay Bhatnagar from CCMB and the first authors of the paper published in Science Advances. By studying an organism known as jakobid, which has been around since before animals and fungi branched off from plants and algae in the process of evolution, the researchers have identified two adjustments that had to take place to facilitate the integration of the two organisms. These adjustments were made in the process of optimisation when the two organisms merged together, evidently for compatibility. The researchers show that these changes, in a protein (DTD) and a tRNA (carrying an amino acid glycine for protein synthesis) are crucial for the successful emergence of mitochondria. Amino acids come with two types of handedness – left-handed and right-handed. Accordingly, their names have a prefix of L or D. All life forms function with only the L-amino acids, in addition to achiral glycine, in proteins. Performing the role of a proofreader, the protein DTD removes D-amino acids from entering protein synthesis. Before it got incorporated into the eukaryotes, when it was part of the bacterial cell, DTD would not act on glycine which is essential for protein synthesis. This preference was changed so that it would be compatible with the eukaryotic cell. “Eukaryotic DTD has changed its recognition code preference in order to avoid untoward removal of glycine, which is a crucial ingredient required for the same. We show in our study that this switch in the recognition code is important without which DTD will be toxic to the eukaryotic cell,” says Rajan Sankaranarayanan of CCMB, who led the work and in whose lab the research was carried out. The other change identified by the researchers is that mitochondrial tRNA(Gly) has changed its critical nucleotide base from U73 to A73, in order to be compatible with eukaryotic DTD. “This switch in the so-called discriminator base of mitochondrial tRNA(Gly) is important for avoiding removal of glycine and thus stopping protein synthesis in mitochondria – which can be toxic,” says Dr Sankaranarayanan. This means that before the change took place in the nucleotide base, glycine would be removed, which would have been toxic for the cell as protein synthesis would not take place without glycine. Next, the researchers plan to investigate these evolutionary dynamics in plant cells. Plant cells have two DTDs and two organelles equipped with translation apparatus of their own. “The work for first time shows how such molecular optimisation strategies are essential, when derived from different ancestors like archaea and bacteria, for the successful emergence of mitochondria and hence all of eukaryotic life as we see today including humans,” says Dr Sankaranarayanan.",Shubashree Desikan,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/how-mitochondria-adapted-to-living-within-cells/article65260518.ece
765,"March 26, 2022",19:10 IST,sci-tech,science,T cell immune responses seen a year after infection," Like in most countries where the Omicron variant had become dominant and caused a high spike in daily cases, the third wave in India propelled by Omicron caused a large number of reinfections in unvaccinated people and breakthrough infections even among the fully vaccinated. However, across the world, the Omicron variant was found to cause only mild disease in fully vaccinated people and in those with previous infection. This was real-world proof that previous infection and/or full vaccination with two doses provide protection against progression of disease to a severe form. Laboratory studies undertaken in all countries have only studied the neutralisation ability of sera of people who have recovered from COVID-19 and people who have been fully vaccinated. This could only shed light on the ability of past infection and/or vaccination to prevent infection by highly transmissive variants with immune escape. But no studies have been done to evaluate the protective effect of memory T cell immune responses against severe disease 12 months after primary infection. A new study from Wuhan addresses this gap. The results were published in the journal The Lancet Microbe. The researchers found that neutralising antibodies were detectable even 12 months after infection in “most individuals”, and it remained stable 6-12 months after initial infection in people younger than 60 years. The researchers found that “multifunctional T cell responses were detected for all SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins tested”.  And most importantly, the magnitude of T cell responses did not show any difference immaterial of how severe the disease was. While the ability of antibodies to neutralise was nearly absent against the Beta variant, it was reduced in the case of the Delta variant.  In contrast, the T cell immune responses were detectable in all the 141 individuals tested 12 months after infection and even when they had lost the neutralising antibody response. And the T cell responses were responding against the Beta variant in most of the 141 individuals.  “SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralising antibody and T cell responses were retained 12 months after initial infection. Neutralising antibodies to the D614G, Beta, and Delta were reduced compared with those for the original strain, and were diminished in general. Memory T cell responses to the original strain were not disrupted by new variants,” they write. “Our findings show that robust antibody and T cell immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is present in majority of recovered patients 12 months after moderate-to-critical infection.” The study reveals the durability and robustness of the T cell responses against variants, including Delta, even after one year of infection. Most importantly, the robust and longstanding T cell responses were seen in people who have not been reinfected or vaccinated. This would mean even in the absence of vaccination, a person who has been infected by the virus even one year ago would have robust immune responses, which would offer protection against disease progressing to a severe form requiring hospitalisation. But the neutralising antibodies were found to diminish at the end of 12 months. It might be recalled that except the Oxford vaccine (AstraZeneca), none of the trials evaluated the ability of the vaccines to prevent infection. The endpoint of all vaccine efficacy studies was to evaluate if vaccinated people developed symptomatic disease or not.  However, the booster doses aggressively pushed by vaccine manufacturers are for preventing infection. And even when the neutralising antibodies increase after a booster shot, they do drop after a few months. No studies have been done to evaluate if booster doses improve T cell immune responses, which is the most important criterion of vaccination. In the case of neutralising antibodies, the researchers found that 121 (85.8%) were positive for neutralising antibodies at the 6 months while there was a slight reduction at the end of 12 months as only 115 (81.6%) were positive for neutralising antibodies.  The neutralising antibody titres did not show any difference based on disease severity — mild or moderate — or in those younger than 60 years. However, the neutralising antibody titres declined in older people and in people with critical disease. A year after infection, 115 of 141 (82%) individuals had neutralising antibodies against the original strain from Wuhan, China. “In contrast, only 68 (48%) had neutralising antibodies against D614G, 32 (23%) had neutralising antibodies against the Beta variant, and 69 (49%) had neutralising antibody responses against the Delta variant”, they write.",R.

766,"March 26, 2022",19:00 IST,sci-tech,science,What is the effecting of thawing permafrost on seafloor?," A new study from Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) researchers and their collaborators have document how the thawing of permafrost, submerged underwater at the edge of the Arctic Ocean, is affecting the seafloor. The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Numerous peer-reviewed studies show that thawing permafrost creates unstable land which negatively impacts important Arctic infrastructure, such as roads, train tracks, buildings, and airports. This infrastructure is expensive to repair, and the impacts and costs are expected to continue increasing. Using advanced underwater mapping technology, MBARI researchers and their collaborators revealed that dramatic changes are happening to the seafloor as a result of thawing permafrost. In some areas, deep sinkholes have formed, some larger than a city block of six-story buildings. In other areas, ice-filled hills called pingos have risen from the seafloor. “We know that big changes are happening across the Arctic landscape, but this is the first time we've been able to deploy technology to see that changes are happening offshore too,” said Charlie Paull, a geologist at MBARI and one of the lead authors of the study, in a release. “This groundbreaking research has revealed how the thawing of submarine permafrost can be detected, and then monitored once baselines are established.” While the degradation of terrestrial Arctic permafrost is attributed in part to increases in mean annual temperature from human-driven climate change, the changes the research team has documented on the seafloor associated with submarine permafrost derive from much older, slower climatic shifts related to our emergence from the last ice age. Similar changes appear to have been happening along the seaward edge of the former permafrost for thousands of years.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/what-is-the-effecting-of-thawing-permafrost-on-seafloor/article65259257.ece
767,"March 26, 2022",12:16 IST,sci-tech,science,Scientists find microplastics in blood for first time," Scientists have discovered microplastics in human blood for the first time, warning that the ubiquitous particles could also be making their way into organs. The tiny pieces of mostly invisible plastic have already been found almost everywhere else on Earth, from the deepest oceans to the highest mountains as well as in the air, soil and food chain. A Dutch study published in the Environment International journal on Thursday examined blood samples from 22 anonymous, healthy volunteers and found microplastics in nearly 80% of them. Half of the blood samples showed traces of PET plastic, widely used to make drink bottles, while more than a third had polystyrene, used for disposable food containers and many other products. ""This is the first time we have actually been able to detect and quantify"" such microplastics in human blood, said Dick Vethaak, an ecotoxicologist at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. ""This is proof that we have plastics in our body — and we shouldn't,"" he told AFP, calling for further research to investigate how it could be impacting health. ""Where is it going in your body? Can it be eliminated? Excreted? Or is it retained in certain organs, accumulating maybe, or is it even able to pass the blood-brain barrier?"" The study said the microplastics could have entered the body by many routes: via air, water or food, but also in products such as particular toothpastes, lip glosses and tattoo ink. ""It is scientifically plausible that plastic particles may be transported to organs via the bloodstream,"" the study added. Mr. Vethaak also said there could be other kinds of microplastics in blood his study did not pick up — for example, it could not detect particles larger than the diameter of the needle used to take the sample.  The study was funded by the Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development as well as Common Seas, a UK-based group aimed at reducing plastic pollution. Alice Horton, anthropogenic contaminants scientist at Britain's National Oceanography Centre, said the study ""unequivocally"" proved there was microplastics in blood. ""This study contributes to the evidence that plastic particles have not just pervaded throughout the environment, but are pervading our bodies too,"" she told the Science Media Centre. Fay Couceiro, reader in biogeochemistry and environmental pollution at the University of Portsmouth, said that despite the small sample size and lack of data on the exposure level of participants, she felt the study was ""robust and will stand up to scrutiny"".  She also called for further research.

768,"March 24, 2022",18:10 IST,sci-tech,science,"If you want to know what’s true, then math is a pretty good place to start, says Abel Prize winner Dennis P. Sullivan"," On March 23, the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters announced their decision to award this year’s Abel Prize to Dennis Parnell Sullivan, American mathematician who is now at the State University of New York, Stony Brook, U.S.. The Abel Prize is a top honour in mathematics, being similar to the Nobel prize for the sciences in being awarded for major contribution to a field of math. Named after the Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel, the prize was instituted by the Norwegian government in 2002. In this interview, Prof. Sullivan talks to The Hindu about his interest in mathematics, early influences and more.  
The second year of college, because I didn't know mathematics existed as a profession until then.
 
I was in chemical engineering [at Rice University, Texas]. But at that university, all the science students, electrical engineers, and everything took math, physics and chemistry. In the second year, when we did complex variables, one day, the Professor drew a picture of a kidney-shaped swimming pool, and a round swimming pool. And he said, you could deform this kidney-shaped swimming pool into the round one. At each point, the distortion is by scaling. A little triangle at this point goes to a similar triangle at the other point. At every point, that's true. We have a formula for the mapping, because we're taking calculus, and we had a notation for discussing it, which we have been studying. But this was like a geometric picture. This mapping was essentially unique. And this was, the nature of this statement was totally different from any math statement I've ever seen before. It was, like, general, deep, and wow! And true! So then, within a few weeks, I changed my major to math.
 
I was able to use that theorem in the 1980s. This was serious.
 
I used this wonderful structure in later research… especially, during a ten-year struggle proving mathematically, by 1990, a numerical universality discovered by physicists in the mid-1970s.
 
Well I don't like names, I like the theorems though! (Laughs) No, no, I'm just kidding.
 
I proved something that physicists discovered, I use the theory behind it to prove something called the universality of the geometry of a certain dynamical process that involved renormalization, as in the physics use of the term in quantum field theory. It was sort of in that genre of ideas, but it was a it was a truly math statement. It could be formulated mathematically, and yet the physicists computed this.
 
The conceptual step in that proof, involved the idea of the Riemann mapping theorem. So proving that universality that was the conceptual part of the proof.
 
In fact, the theorem is true by experiment, in a whole continuum of situations, it's only the integer ones where it's been proven, because you have to use this idea from Riemann mapping theorem. And that idea doesn't work in the other cases, as far as we know.
 
That was called the Einstein chair seminar. And it was, well, it was the regular format – you invited speakers, they would come and tell the stuff. But we didn't have a time limit. During an hour-long talk, you can stop the speaker a few times. You can't stop him all the time, you know, so it would be open-ended. Sometimes it would go, you know, more than three hours. In fact, the record is from 2.00 to 8.30. I think, finally, the guy had to have a beer. He was from Germany. (Laughs) He wanted to beat the record, though, and he did beat it.
 
Eventually, I would ask many of the questions, but then the students would start asking, too, because it was okay, and there's no such thing as a stupid question. That was that was the rule. No such thing as a stupid question. But it should be a precise question. That was the Einstein chair seminar. And it's still going on. But now it's more traditional format, although not always… And now we can do Zoom.
 
Well, I mean, I'm an outsider in that field. I'm very interested in it, but I'm not really an expert. It has been very active since then. It's because they now know how to describe in principle, all three dimensional manifolds. If you have any kind of a knot or a link, you can think of cutting out small neighborhoods from space around that knot or link, and then you're left with a three dimensional manifold, you break it up into geometric pieces – the [William] Thurston picture. So it's like when you have a linear transformation matrix and you know its eigenvalues, you know a lot about it. Right. They have something like that now, for knots. It opened up the possibility of proving many things with the basic Poincare group, or fundamental group of every three manifold, using group theoretic properties. And this is interesting, because already in dimension 4, 5, 6, and so on, the possible groups you can get are everything. One knows this is from the 50s, that it's a logically undecidable question. In dimension three, the groups that appear are not arbitrary. They're very rich, and very structured, and Perelman’s, proof of the Thurston picture gives you an opening to it. Thurston, proved a lot of it [but] didn't prove the whole thing. But this step gives you a way to analyse the groups in three dimensional spaces. It's been very active, one of the Breakthrough prizes, for Ian Agol, was based on what he did about these groups after Thurston’s picture and Perelman’s proof. It allowed many breakthroughs, in my opinion, but I'm not really a bonafide expert. Okay? I've been watching it, though. All this time.
 
First of all, it's related to being a chemical engineer. If you're in Texas, as a student of chemical engineering, that is, there's the petrochemical industry, the oil industry, and organic chemistry and plastics, all around Houston. If you are good in science, and you work on that and become an engineer you can get a good job and have a nice work at a research center. So it's a good thing to do. In fact, during the summers, I had jobs at various such places. Once I had to study the computer methods that they were using to do what's called secondary recovery. You know, when they find oil, because of the pressure, if they drill a hole, the pressure makes it shoot up, right. But after they drill for 20 years, the pressure goes down. What they do then is go to another part of the field, and they drill and they pump in water to create pressure that will push the oil back to their wells, and for this they have to solve the linearised version of the Navier Stokes equation. I didn't know that name, then but it's a linearised version of the Navier Stokes equation. While at the summer job where I was studying the possible computer programs I had a certain question there. That was around 1960. And that was related to how they would place their wells for getting to secondary recovery.
 
Moira [Moira Chas] and I were visiting Saudi Arabia 35 years later, and I went to this company, Aramco. This is a big, huge company... and they were studying the same problem from 35 years before.
 
So in a sense, I was aware that there's this huge industry related to fluid flow through porous media. It was astonishing to me to find out as I found out in the 1990s, that that equations in three dimensions, the beautiful equations, are not solved.
 
And then later, in 2000, that became one of the millennium problems. There are these famous seven problems. The only one that's been solved is by Perelman [Poincare conjecture], the one that you just referred to.
 
I got an idea. I had an idea that maybe the idea of calculus and expression in terms of partial differential equations is a little too presumptuous. Namely, you have this physical process, which we know is atomic – it's made out of particles. But you see these smooth flows everywhere. So you say, okay, let's model this, like with Newton's calculus, right? Then you find a differential equation, like in every physics course, you would make a little box and put dx, dy and put force and write something and then take the limit as the box goes to zero to get the equation.
 
Well, that has worked like a charm for many problems, right? You get a beautiful equation here. I love the equation, because it had a geometric meaning that I understood, but it hasn't worked!
 
I thought about it. Maybe you've done things out of order. First, you imagine the fluid, and you take this calculus limit, and get a beautiful equation. Then when you want to put it on a computer, what do you do? You go backwards. You say, you can't put an infinite formula on the computer, and you can't put derivatives. Right? Instead of derivatives, you put f (x + h) - f (x) / h. So you put that on the computer, and then you crank away?
 
Well, here's what you started with! You went to this ideal continuum, made this PDE. Then you take the PDE out, and you do a discrete process. You're going in and out. So I thought why don't I just go this way.
 
And there's one precedent for this when you study the Laplacian it is called the heat equation. If you just have a conducting medium and you put some heat down, it spreads out like the Gaussian, the heat spreads out. But that formula can be deduced from putting discrete little dots equally spaced and think a particle of heat spreads out with probability half that it goes this way, probability half that goes that way. And then you write that coin flipping process. And then it turns out, you see things in the discrete approximation that allow you to make sense of this equation in a much more general way, it gives you a great advantage as a theory of Markov processes, Kolmogorov’s work, all that stuff comes from this probabilistic viewpoint. So I could hope that if you did a discrete process, there might be some nonlinear version of something new that you would see, that would help you.
 
I've been trying for 30 years. And I don't have any theorems to show for it. But I'm understanding more and more yet.
 
I usually find I want to think about [a question] from the beginning, I want to understand it. That's all I want - to try to understand it. Sometimes it solves problems, it’s not like I choose a problem. I want to understand an area. Yeah.
 
I've seen instances where, when a story kind of comes to equilibrium. And it's like the perfect answer. If you actually look at that answer. And then you read backwards through the whole history of ideas. You'll see [that] way back at the beginning, if they had looked at it, not the way it went, but they looked at it, turned slightly and went this way, they would have gone directly to the answer,.
 
You can sort of forget a lot of the false starts, then make it very simple another way, say, you can make a very simple picture, assume this, prove this this way. And there's one idea here, this is one picture, and then some easy stuff. That's often the way math stories are, from beginning to end. That's not exactly the history.
 
Mathematics, when it's done and perfect, is absolutely perfect and simple. If things are not simple, then they're not done.
 
It turns out that the real great things have the property that the steps get submerged into the definitions, and they get back to teaching them to the undergraduates and eventually are teaching in high school. Euclid’s geometry, it's high school stuff, Right? But you know, deep, so, everything should be simple and basic.
 
Oh, yeah. Well, there's a blessing and a curse to that. Because, you know, the beautiful thing about math, which is really one of the most powerful aspects of it is that the concepts can be perfectly clear. There's only one point related to Godel’s theorem, where there's some ambiguity, we start from some simple notion, which is called a collection of objects. That notion has properties and one has to assume that, and then, if you assume that, with those properties, mathematics begins. Relative to that assumption, it’s perfectly precise.
 
Math has this potential clarity of concept. You'd never see mathematicians arguing about a math statement. They can agree very quickly that they're talking about the same thing. Then, if one of them thinks it is true, then, “Oh, do you have a proof?” Either he has a proof or he doesn’t. If he doesn't have a proof? We agree on the statement, but it becomes unknown. He doesn't say “Well, I think it's true.” You know, that has no meaning. Or [if he says] “I don't think that's true.” Then it is, “Well, do you have a counterexample?” If the answer is “No, but I don't think it's true,” then I don't care. And they agree, they don't get mad at each other because those are the rules of the game. Because the concepts are precise. This is remarkable. Among all the other sciences, there's nothing like this.
 
Now, that precision, though, is sort of a curse, because even when you're talking to people, almost everything that's said is not precise, because there 're tacit assumptions.
 
I'm too literal. My wife makes jokes with me every three minutes, and I take them seriously, for example.
 
But then the other thing, the positive side of the question is that I like to talk to six-year-olds about math, because they're like little mathematicians. They want to know how big numbers are, how big space is, and I like to see the picture in a proof. If you have a picture that shows the essence of proof, you could show it to the child.
 
It’s just natural to see patterns. But then there is this thing about precision, of language, which is sort of an inconvenience in some ways, although it's a blessing in mathematics itself.
 
Yeah, so I usually approach things in this mathematical way, a little more than I should sometimes. And I think many difficult math things often have a little picture that can be shared with somebody. In Fact, even Hilbert said, If what you're doing can't be explained to the common man, you don't understand it. He said that when you meet this the person on the street, you don't need formulas. That's why I hate names and notation. Because that allows you to pretend you know what you're talking about. When you don't necessarily know what you're talking about. You have a lot of jargon.
 
Well, I think I kind of replaced my spirituality and Catholicism with mathematics. You want to know what you can know? Right? What can you know to be true? Math is a pretty good, unfortunately, it only deals with very simple questions. You know, psychology, physics deals with the nature of the universe. Mathematics deals with physics. There is something remarkable, and unexplained in the universe we live in, and also mathematics itself. I believe mathematics would be the same. If there's life on other planets, I think they might have discovered different parts and gone to some different direction. Like, if we just were doing computer science, you would sort of emphasize more on graph theory and combinatorics, and algorithms. But you know, they might not have done Lie groups yet. Those are all sort of primitive aspects of your question. But if you want to know what's true, then math is a pretty good place to start establishing what it means to know something. In math, we sort of had this certain point, we don't know any absolute fact, in some sense, unless it involves finite systems, but anything that involves something like calculus with an infinite system can only be rigorous and known to be true relative to this basic starting point, I mentioned about set theory, you have to assume there are sets of points... Then you can build the numbers and build the real, you can build the integers. You can build the numbers, and you can build the continuum, then you can build spaces and Lie groups and the rest of mathematics, but it's all relative to this assumption at the beginning. But that's knowing something, you know! If this is consistent, then all of this is consistent, and this is very simple and very believable. So that's the kind of religion in a way, the mathematicians believe that these systems, this basis is okay. They're willing to spend their lives working on that. So, that's almost religion, right?
 
I think my first visit was to Chennai. Which I had trouble finding because I knew it as Madras. I remember. I was trying to book a plane ticket to Madras and I had trouble getting there. Let's see. If I just think back about it. I remember the cows in the street in Chennai, and the cars and everyone being together. There's no problem.
 
I also learned that vegetarian food could be delicious. Well, I've had a lot of Indian graduate students, so I kind of know them. I know Indian people.
 
I could say something that I say to my graduate students: critical thinking is important. It's good to think critically, examine your beliefs, understand why they're commonly held, and then maybe, in certain circumstances, you have to modify them slightly, to make them work better. That's what has helped me understand mathematics better. For example, even what you learned from your masters, sometimes, it’s their perspective. Having a perspective is excellent, which is kind of like a bias. It is good because it makes you more effective and you can put your energy in those directions, right? But then sometimes, it's not right. In some situations or some points of view, there's a different way to look at it. And this may help you make progress in a direction that was blocked with previous perspective. This is not [being] critical in the sense of [being] negative, it's critical in the sense of examining. So critical thinking is, and I'm borrowing this from a wonderful interview of Bertrand Russell in 1952, He says a lot of very charming and very intelligent things, but he also emphasises this point that when you have a perspective, it sometimes allows you to make irrational rational decisions. you know, So it's good to be critical, even of your own beliefs because it helps. That works in math too.

770,"March 23, 2022",16:35 IST,sci-tech,science,Abel prize for 2022 goes to American mathematician Dennis P. Sullivan," The Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters has awarded the Abel prize for the year 2022 to American Mathematician Dennis Parnell Sullivan, who is with the Graduate School and University Center of the City University of New York and the State University of New York at Stony Brook. The citation mentions that the award has been given, “For his groundbreaking contributions to topology in its broadest sense, and in particular its algebraic, geometric and dynamical aspects.” Topology is a field of mathematics which was born in the nineteenth century and has to do with properties of surfaces that do not change when they are deformed. Topologically, a circle and a square are the same; similarly, surfaces of a doughnut and a coffee mug with one handle are topologically equivalent, however the surface of a sphere and a coffee mug are not equivalent. This mapping was what excited Dennis P. Sullivan when he was in the second year of a Chemical Engineering course at Rice University, Texas. “The epiphany for me was watching the professor explaining that any surface topologically like a balloon, and no matter what shape - a banana or the statue of David by Michelangelo could be placed on to a perfectly round sphere so that the stretching or squeezing. required at each and every point is the same in all directions at each such point,” he said. Further the correspondence was unique once the location of three points was specified and these points could be specified arbitrarily… “This was general , deep and absolutely beautiful,” he recalls. He at once changed his major to take up mathematics, which became his lifelong interest. He was so struck by this concept that he used it in later research, especially during a 10-year struggle with a proving mathematically, by 1990, a numerical Universality discovered by physicists in the mid-1970s. “Dennis P. Sullivan has repeatedly changed the landscape of topology by introducing new concepts, proving landmark theorems, answering old conjectures and formulating new problems that have driven the field forwards,” says Hans Munthe-Kaas, chair of the Abel Committee, in a press release given by the Academy. The release further says that Prof. Sullivan has found deep connections between a variety of areas of mathematics. One of his key breakthroughs is in developing a new way of understanding rational homotopy theory, a subfield of algebraic topology. Later, in the late 1970s, he started working on dynamical systems, a field considered far removed from algebraic topology. Dynamical systems is the study of a point moving in geometrical space. In 1999, he and his wife and collaborator, Moira Chas, discovered a new invariant for a manifold based on loops, creating the field of string topology. Dennis P. Sullivan has won numerous awards, among them the Steele Prize, the 2010 Wolf Prize in Mathematics and the 2014 Balzan Prize for Mathematics. He is also a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.",Shubashree Desikan,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/abel-prize-for-2022-goes-to-american-mathematician-dennis-p-sullivan/article65251992.ece

The Abel Prize is named after the Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel. The prize was instituted in 2002, to commemorate his 200-th birth anniversary. The Fields Medal and the Abel Prize are the two important international prizes for mathematics. While the Fields Medal honours brilliant work done by a mathematician below the age of forty years, the Abel Prize has no age limit and is more of a lifetime achievement award celebrating important contributions made to a field of mathematics. The first Abel Prize, awarded in 2003, went to French mathematician Jean-Pierre Serre. The only person of Indian origin to have won this prize is Srinivasa S.R. Varadhan. He is at the Courant Institute, New York University, and won it in 2007. So far, the prize has gone to only one woman mathematician, Karen Keskulla Uhlenbeck of University of Texas, U.S.A. The prize consists of a citation and a prize money of 7.5 million Norwegian Kroner. A short film on the tragic story of mathematician Niels Henrik Abel is available on the website of the Abel Prize. Indian math afficionados will see the parallel to the life of Ramanujan. Abel was a young genius who, when he was just 22, showed the unsolvability of the quintic equation, which had puzzled mathematicians for 250 years. In 1826, he presented an important theorem in Paris; however the manuscript was misplaced. While trying to derive his lost treatise, he contracted tuberculosis and died three years later on April 6, 1829, when he was only 26 years old. Just two days after his death, the Paris treatise was discovered. Now, his discovery forms the mathematical basis for the CT scan.

India presently has a single station, Himadri, in Ny-Alesund, Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago, where research personnel are usually present for 180 days. India is in the process of procuring an ice-breaker research vessel that can navigate the region.  Through its existing network of satellites, India aspires to capture more detailed images to “assist in the development of the Arctic region.” The Arctic has eight states— Canada, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Iceland, Russia, Sweden and the United States — that comprise the Arctic Council. It is home to about 4 million, a tenth of them being indigenous tribes. India has had a research base in the region since 2008 and also has two observatories. Arctic weather influences the Indian monsoon and hence has been of interest to Indian researchers for decades. Climate change and the melting of ice caps imply changes to the Arctic weather.  India has so far sent 13 expeditions to the Arctic since 2007 and runs 23 active science projects. About 25 institutes and universities are currently involved in Arctic research in India and close to a hundred peer-reviewed papers have been published on Arctic issues since 2007, the Ministry of Science and Technology said in a statement. It has the status of ‘Observer’ member — 12 other countries have such a status — in the Arctic Council and participates in several meetings that are mostly themed around research. Beyond science, India also expects business opportunities.  “Explore opportunities for responsible exploration of natural resources and minerals in the Arctic...identify opportunities for investment in Arctic infrastructure such as offshore exploration, mining, ports, railways, information technology and airports.

775,"March 19, 2022",19:45 IST,sci-tech,science,How are mosquitoes able to avoid insect repellents?," In what they call surprise findings, Johns Hopkins Medicine scientists report that unlike fruit flies, mosquitoes' odour sensing nerve cells shut down when those cells are forced to produce odour-related proteins, or receptors, on the surface of the cell. This ""expression"" process apparently makes the bugs able to ignore common insect repellents. In contrast, when odour sensors in fruit flies are forced to express odour receptors, it prompts flight from some smelly situations. So the researchers designed their research project suspecting they'd find that mosquitoes have the same reaction as fruit flies when their new odour sensors are forced to be expressed. The researchers then tested this on female Anopheles mosquitoes. The idea was that if researchers could push mosquito odour neurons into a similar expression state, triggered by odorants already on the skin, the mosquitoes would avoid the scent and fly off. But they found that the mosquitoes had very little response to common animal scents, benzaldehyde and indole, as well as chemical odorants in general, says a press release. The researchers tested how mosquitoes modified to overexpress an odour receptor that responded to odorants in common insect repellents, such as lemongrass. They found that the genetically modified mosquitoes were able to ignore insect repellents. The researchers suspect that the odour receptor shutdown may be a kind of failsafe in mosquitoes, ensuring that only one type of odorant receptor is expressed at a single time. Mosquitoes have been found to be trickier than initially thought.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/how-are-mosquitoes-able-to-avoid-insect-repellents/article65240016.ece
776,"March 19, 2022",19:41 IST,sci-tech,science,"Lessons the current wave in China, Hong Kong offer"," Following a long period of Zero COVID tolerance, China and Hong Kong are witnessing faster and widely spreading waves compared to earlier waves. Despite the current lower death rate, these countries may face a transient shortage of medical resources in the short term. Any wave in any part of the world occurs when the susceptible pool of uninfected people crosses a population-level threshold. This is a defining feature of any infectious disease outbreak. Almost every wave may be characterised as a state of disequilibrium caused by the interaction of three elements of the epidemiological triad. Understanding the virus (agent), the human (immune) response (host), and environmental factors is required to comprehend how susceptible pools are formed. The agent (SARS-CoV-2) is distinguished by the emergence of newer variants, whereas at the host level, the duration of protection provided by antibodies dwindles over time. Compliance with mask and crowding restrictions, as well as proactive actions implemented during waves are examples of environmental influences. In China and Hong Kong, imposing severe restrictions such as lockdown changed only the environmental factors, transiently protecting the susceptible pool and eventually postponing the waves. Air cannot be shut down; the virus has an unrestricted global pass disregarding geographical boundaries. With Omicron and its stealth form, any person with an infectious variant, once connected to a susceptible pool can cause massive outbreaks. South Korea, which was initially lauded for its better control, is reeling under pressure, with hospital bed occupancy reaching 64%, despite 63% of the country’s 52 million population receiving booster shots. China, on the other hand, has achieved 38% booster dosage coverage and is at the tipping point, to witness significant number of infections, when it has to open up eventually. Several factors influence the natural course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Among them, the action taken in the first and subsequent waves play a significant role. Velásquez et al from the Universidad Nacional de San Agustín de Arequipa, Perú, use the example of three countries that experienced identical illness transmission dynamics during the first month, then differed due to government policies such as quarantine, closed borders, and other restrictions. As a result, rather than local strategies, a viable exit strategy for COVID-19 should take the form of a global control program. A few countries that tried Zero COVID policies locally (New Zealand, Australia, and now China) were unsuccessful and will be compelled to abandon this plan. The goalposts for attaining herd immunity have shifted with COVID-19. The fallacy of herd immunity is perpetuated by an incorrect characterisation of a similar strategy against stable viruses, as well as the belief in long-lasting immunity, both of which have been disproven. A ‘wave’ arises when there is a substantial enough number of cases in a specific period. The lesson from ongoing waves is that the Omicron variant is unstoppable, both in its original and modified forms, and is destined to spread to nearly every part of the planet. China’s Zero COVID approach and South Korea’s early success can no longer deter its spread. Is that a good sign? Uncertainty is the only certainty at this point, depending on what happens next in the virus’s evolution. It would be a relief if this is the last of the virus’s iteration, attuned to cohabit with humans. Alternative trajectories in viral evolution are equally likely, if not more probable, to result in either a more contagious or virulent newer version. The problem in identifying future waves or other infectious disease outbreaks is that some areas do not have robust surveillance systems. Without knowing the expected number of cases of an illness, predicting the extra cases, which constitute a wave, is difficult. Areas with missed circulation provide a fertile ecosystem for the development of newer variants. More than ever, creating and strengthening surveillance systems to identify and tackle future disease outbreaks are essential lifesaving investments. Creating such systems must include enhanced spending by States in hiring and sustaining trained manpower, who can manage decentralised epidemiological and genomic surveillance programmes, using standard definitions and processes. Data from such this system can provide an expected and excess number of cases, to warrant initiating appropriate actions. Monitoring the virus and host-related factors over time necessitate the need of enhanced use of epidemiological tools enabled by strengthened and sustained efforts in syndromic and genomic surveillance, conducting regular serosurveys or establishing sentinel-based serosurveillance platforms. Given the uncertainty around how the virus will adopt, what is in our control is to track each of the constitution of epidemiological triad, and act proactively and early enough. We cannot afford to blame the new variant next time, not if, but when there is one. (Giridhara R.

777,"March 19, 2022",19:41 IST,sci-tech,science,Do looks correlate with caregiving in frogs and toads?," Parental caregiving in animals is associated with an element of risk of being attacked by predators. On another track, body colours and patterns are believed to have evolved because they protect the animal against attacks by the predator. Tying these two facets together, researchers from Indian Institute of Science asked whether parental caregiving is associated with body colour, patterns and even dichromatism in frog and toad species. Dichromatism is when the two sexes have different colouration, at least in parts. The results of their study and analysis are published online in the journal Evolution. Parental caregiving in frogs and toads has many associated questions: Does the species provide care at all, or not? If they do, which of the parents (male or female or both) provides the care? Since frogs and toads, clubbed together as anurans, are amphibians, the question of whether they provide care in the water or land becomes relevant. The study seeks to find if the listed aspects of care are correlated with the way the animals look. Starting from a list of approximately 1,200 species, the researchers narrowed down the study to 988 species, which they proceeded to analyse. “We found that species that show parental care were more likely to be non-dichromatic species, which means that males and females look similar. This pattern is independent of whether the male or the female cares for the offspring,” says Maria Thaker in whose lab at the Centre for Ecological Sciences, IISc, the study was carried out, in an email to The Hindu. Dr. Thaker explains what may be the reason behind this: “When one sex of a dichromatic species is brightly coloured or patterned to attract mates, for example, that sex is more conspicuous to potential predators as well. It’s dangerous to be conspicuous. This is why we predicted that the evolution of caregiving should coincide with the evolution of minimising the risk of unwanted attention, and hence monochromatic species are more likely to show caregiving.” Dorsal colours were independent of the occurrence of care. “So, whether a species cares for their offspring or not has no bearing on what colour they are. This contradicted our expectation that providing care is dangerous and therefore caregivers should be camouflaged or aposematic,” she adds. Being aposematic refers to being brightly coloured to warn off predators. This gives the indication to predators that the animal may be poisonous to consume. “The presence of dorsal stripes was significantly correlated with species where males alone cared, but none of the other five pattern categories were significantly correlated (Plain, Bands, Spots, Mottled-Patches),” says K. S. Seshadri, who is a DST-INSPIRE Faculty Fellow in Dr. Thaker’s lab. “In species where females alone care, none of the colours and patterns were correlated with the occurrence of care.” Dr. Seshadri adds that perhaps the presence of stripes provides the advantage of flicker fusion where a predator is unable to accurately detect the position of the prey. This potential explanation remains to be tested. The work shows how studying amphibians can help in understanding more generally evolutionary biology, behaviour and ecology. Dr Seshadri says, in this context, “Our work includes 988 species in which we are certain about parental care. There are over 7,000 species of anurans out there and we know very little about their ecology and behaviour. There is clearly a need to bridge knowledge gaps for amphibians are among the most threatened vertebrates.”",Shubashree Desikan,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/do-looks-correlate-with-caregiving-in-frogs-and-toads/article65240000.ece
778,"March 19, 2022",19:40 IST,sci-tech,science,Recombination of two virus variants seen since 2020," Mutations are a natural phenomenon when viruses replicate. Generally, RNA viruses have a higher rate of mutations compared with DNA viruses. However, unlike other RNA viruses, coronaviruses have fewer mutations. This is because coronaviruses have a genetic “proofreading mechanism” that corrects some of the errors made during replication. This is applicable to SARS-CoV-2 viruses too. As a result, SARS-CoV-2 viruses have “higher fidelity in its transcription and replication process than that of other single-stranded RNA viruses” says a February 2021 paper in Nature. The fate of new mutations depends on whether such mutations increase the fitness of the virus such as increasing the infectiousness of the virus and in light of many people being infected and/or vaccinated, the ability of the mutations to allow the virus to escape from immunity. Such mutations that provide increased fitness to the virus increase in numbers and become the dominant strain or variant. But changes to the virus through natural collection of mutations involves small changes in the genome. But like in the case of influenza viruses, when a person is simultaneously infected with two different SARS-CoV-2 variants or strains or sub-lineages, chunks of genetic material from one variant can get mixed with the other. This is called recombination. In the case of SARS-CoV-2 virus, such recombination has been seen right after the Alpha variant emerged. Alpha was the first variant to emerge in late-2020 in the U.K. At that time, the dominant strain that had spread to most countries was the Wuhan strain with a mutation called the D614G, which increased the transmissibility of the virus. According to a paper published on September 30, 2021 in the journal Cell, recombinant SARS-CoV-2 viruses were found in late 2020-early 2021 in the U.K. The recombinant virus had a combination of the Alpha variant and the Wuhan strain. The recombinant virus had the mutations seen in the spike protein of the Alpha variant while the remaining genome with the wild strain. Since the mutations seen in the Alpha variant made the virus more transmissible, the recombinant virus was found to spread. The researchers were able to find four instances of the recombinant virus spreading, including “one transmission cluster of 45 sequenced cases over the course of two months”. The researchers identified 16 recombinant sequences from a large dataset of 2,79,000 genome sequenced by U.K. up to March 7, 2021. Despite the recombinant virus inheriting the spike region with mutations from the Alpha variant, it did not have better fitness than the Alpha variant and hence did not become dominant. After Alpha, the variant to emerge was the Delta. There was a short window when both Delta and Alpha were present in many countries before Delta wiped out the Alpha variant. Another study found a SARS-CoV-2 recombinant of Alpha and Delta variants. In mid-August 2021, researchers in Japan found six clinical isolates that were recombinants of the Alpha and Delta variants. In a preprint posted in medRxiv on October 14, 2021, the researchers say the recombinant could have emerged through simultaneous infection by both variants in a person but were unable to find any patient with mixed infection. Again, this recombinant did not have added fitness to increase in frequency. It just died out. After Delta, the Omicron variant emerged and it was soon split into two sub-lineages BA.1 and BA.2. With both the Delta and Omicron variants being present simultaneously in many countries, there were “lots of opportunities to co-infect, recombine and transmit onwards”, says virologist Tom Peacock from Imperial College, London in a tweet. Researchers have so far found two possible recombinants — 1) Delta and BA.1, and 2) BA.1 and BA.2. The recombinant of Delta and BA.1 has been found in the U.K and France, while the recombinant of the Omicron sub-lineages BA.1 and BA.2 has been found in the U.K. The recombination of Delta and BA.1 found in France is called XD, and it contains the “Spike protein of BA.1 and the rest of the genome from Delta. It currently comprises several tens of sequences. The recombination of Delta and Omicron sub-lineage BA.1 found in the U.K. is called XF. According to Dr Peacock, XF has the spike and structural proteins from BA.1 and the remaining part of the genome from Delta. “It comprises several tens of sequences currently,” he says. The recombination of two Omicron sub-lineages BA.1 and BA.2 has been found in the U.K and is called XE. It was also recently reported in two passengers who had arrived in Israel. It has the spike and structural proteins from BA.2 and the remaining genome from BA.1. The XE is the most prevalent with hundreds of genomes already sequenced. “XD is maybe a little more concerning. It has been found in Germany, Netherlands and Denmark and it contains the structural proteins from Delta. If any of these recombinants were to act much differently than its parent it might be XD,” Dr Peacock tweeted. Recombination of Delta and Omicron variants was found in the U.S. as well. The researchers found the “existence of these three unique mutation profiles that present compelling evidence that a recombinant virus was generated during co-infection…This recombinant replicated sufficiently to reach copy numbers that were detected by sequencing,” they write in a preprint posted in medRxiv on March 9, 2022. They identified “20 cases of co-infection with the Delta and Omicron variants, and two cases infected by a virus resulting from the recombination of Delta and Omicron”. These two cases that contain only the recombinant virus of Delta and Omicron suggest that the actual recombination had happened in another person and increased in numbers in that person through replication and then effectively transmitted to a new host. “Yet, despite transmitting to a new host at least once, the transmission chain was not sustained; we have not observed any more of these recombinants in our sequencing data,” they write.",R.

779,"March 17, 2022",01:44 IST,sci-tech,science,"Physicist Eugene Parker, who theorized the existence of solar wind, dies aged 94"," Eugene Parker, a physicist who theorized the existence of solar wind and became the first person to witness the launch of a spacecraft bearing his name, has died, his son and the University of Chicago said Wednesday.  His son, Eric Parker, said Eugene Parker died peacefully at a retirement community in Chicago on Tuesday, about a decade after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. He was 94.  NASA administrators and university colleagues hailed Parker as a visionary in his field of heliophysics, focused on the study of the sun and other stars. He is best known for his 1958 theory of the existence of solar wind — a supersonic flow of particles off the sun's surface.  “Dr. Eugene Parker’s contributions to science and to understanding how our universe works touches so much of what we do here at NASA,” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a statement. “Dr. Parker’s legacy will live on through the many active and future NASA missions that build upon his work.” Parker recalled in 2018 that his solar wind theory was widely criticized and even mocked at publication. He was vindicated in 1962 when a NASA spacecraft mission to Venus confirmed his theory and solar wind's effect on the solar system, including occasional disruptions of communications systems on Earth.  The experience became part of Parker's identity as an educator and mentor. “If you do something new or innovative, expect trouble,” he said in 2018 when asked to give advice to early career scientists. ""But think critically about it because if you’re wrong, you want to be the first one to know that.” Parker was born in 1927 in Houghton, Michigan. He studied physics at Michigan State University and California Institute of Technology, then worked as an assistant professor at the University of Utah before coming to the University of Chicago in 1955.  Eric Parker said he and his sister, Joyce, simply knew their dad was a scientist and didn't learn about his stature in the field until later in their lives.  The elder Parker would occasionally rise from the dinner table to jot down an idea, his son said. But his children most remember Parker as an involved dad and an avid hiker, camper and craftsman who carved busts of famous figures from wood and made much of the family's furniture. “He always felt like workaholics were missing out,” Eric Parker said Wednesday. “He loved his job and he would tell you that when he discovered physics, he would have done it as a side gig because he enjoyed it so much. But he would also go on and on that if you’re getting over 40 hours a week in your job, you were missing out on the rest of life.”  In addition to his children, Eugene Parker is survived by his wife, Niesje, and three grandsons.  NASA honored Mr. Parker's scientific contributions in 2018 by naming a spacecraft after him that was destined to travel straight into the sun's crown. The Parker Solar Probe's successful launch — which the then-91-year-old Parker attended — has since provided unprecedented close views of the sun. Angela Olinto, dean of the physical sciences division at the University of Chicago, accompanied Parker to the launch. She recalled his seemingly boundless energy in the early morning hours preceding the launch and his childlike grin when everything went smoothly. “He was this ideal of a physicist: a person who has a strong intuition, who can see one step ahead and who can then sit down and show the intuition is correct,” Olinto said  Dr. Nicola Fox, director of NASA's Heliophysics Division, said Parker “was a visionary,"" adding that she will miss sharing the latest data from the probe's travels with him.  “Even though Dr. Parker is no longer with us, his discoveries and legacy will live forever,"" Fox said.

780,"March 16, 2022",14:05 IST,sci-tech,science,Science for All | Lead’s brain damage," This article forms a part of the Science for All newsletter that takes the jargon out of science and puts the fun in! Subscribe now! In the early 20 th century, as cars were beginning to be popular in the United States, lead was first added to petrol to help keep car engines healthy. However, a recent study calculates that exposure to car exhaust from leaded gas during childhood stole a collective 824 million IQ points from more than 170 million Americans alive today, about half the population of the United States. Lead in cars was banned in the US in 1996, but as a consequence, Americans born before 1996 may now be at greater risk for lead-related health problems as several had worryingly high lead exposures as children. Lead is neurotoxic and can erode brain cells after it enters the body. As such, there is no safe level of exposure at any point in life, health experts say. Young children are especially vulnerable to lead’s ability to impair brain development and lower cognitive ability. Unfortunately, no matter what age, our brains are ill-equipped for keeping it at bay. Lead is able to reach the bloodstream once it’s inhaled as dust, or ingested, or consumed in water and is able to pass through the blood-brain barrier, which otherwise, effectively keeps out a lot of toxicants and pathogens out of the brain, but not all of them. The researchers determined this relationship using publicly available data on US childhood blood-lead levels, leaded-gas use, and population statistics, they determined the likely lifelong burden of lead exposure carried by every American alive in 2015. From this data, they estimated lead’s assault on our intelligence by calculating IQ points lost from leaded gas exposure as a proxy for its harmful impact on public health.

781,"March 14, 2022",10:30 IST,sci-tech,science,The functioning of the ISS after sanctions," The story so far: After Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, the U.S. imposed sanctions on Russia including a ban on transfer of technology and on Russian banks. Following this, on March 3, the Russian space agency Roscosmos tweeted the following, “The State Corporation will not co-operate with Germany on joint experiments in the Russian segment of the International Space Station. Roscosmos will conduct them independently. The Russian space programme against the backdrop of sanctions will be adjusted, the priority will be creation of satellites in the interests of defence. Roscosmos will not service the remaining 24 R-180 engines in the United States, and stop supplying the R-181. “ According to a Reuters report, this was followed by a statement from the head of the Russian Space Agency — Roscosmos — Dmitry Rogozin on Telegram, where he demanded the lift of the sanctions, some of which predate Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. He said that the sanctions could disrupt the functioning of the Russian spacecraft that serviced the International Space Station. This could lead to the Russian segment of the ISS, which helps in correcting the orbit of the ISS being affected. He said that this meant the ISS could fall into the sea or on the land. He further said that the Russian segment ensures that the space station’s orbit is corrected to keep it away from space debris, roughly 11 times a year. He pointed out, publishing a map, that the ISS would likely crash down on some country, but most probably not Russia itself. The ISS is built with the co-operation of scientists from five international space agencies — NASA of the U.S., Roscosmos of Russia, JAXA of Japan, Canadian Space Agency and the European Space Agency. Each agency has a role to play and a share in the upkeep of the ISS. Both in terms of expense and effort, it is not a feat that a single country can support. Russia’s part in the collaboration is the module responsible for making course corrections to the orbit of the ISS. They also ferry astronauts to the ISS from the Earth and back. Until SpaceX’s dragon spacecraft came into the picture the Russian spacecrafts were the only way of reaching the ISS and returning. Due to its enormous weight and the ensuing drag, the ISS tends to sink from its orbit at a height of about 250 miles above the Earth. It has to be pushed up to its original line of motion every now and then. This is rather routine, even for smaller satellites, says Dr. Mylswamy Annadurai, former director of ISRO and presently Vice President of Tamil Nadu State Council for Science and Technology.  Approximately once a month this effort has to be made. It is not necessarily a regular operation, and may be missed once and compensated for later. The other reason for altering the path of the ISS is to avoid its collision with space debris, which can damage the station.  These manoeuvres need to be done as and when the debris is encountered. Manoeuvering the ISS is expensive. In a year, 7-8 tonnes of fuel may need to be spent, with each manoeuvre costing nearly a tonne of fuel. If a manoeuvre is put off for later, the ISS may sink a little more and the delayed operation would cost more as a larger correction needs to be made. There are right now two possibilities. SpaceX’s dragon module and Boeing’s Starliner can dock with the ISS. Starliner also has the capacity to carry, say, ten tonnes of fuel. Though there have been previous occasions when conflicts have risen between Russia and the U.S., the operation of the ISS has not been interrupted. Dr. Annadurai points out that there are two missions planned for March 18, and one astronaut is already there on site. The mission means to take up two Russians and an American astronaut, and the preparatory work is in progress. On March 30, it is planned that the mission will return an American astronaut to Earth from the ISS. These seem to be going on as per plan. “Going by the scientists’ mindset and that such a significant global effort must not go down the drain, my feeling is that scientists from both sides will work together and that this effort will not be in vain,” says Dr. Annadurai. The orbit of the ISS does not fly over the Russian territory mostly. Places that are closer to the equator run a greater risk of it falling in their domain. The orbit is at about 50 degrees and so most probably, the ISS will fall in that level. But this is only a probability, as it can move or disintegrate. But in case of this eventuality, people in the ISS will be brought back, modules can be detached thereby making it much smaller which will ensure that it disintegrates before touching the earth.",Shubashree Desikan,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/the-functioning-of-the-iss-after-sanctions/article65222287.ece
782,"March 14, 2022",10:30 IST,sci-tech,science,The genetic variants causing severe COVID-19," The story so far: Scientists in the United Kingdom as part of a research project, GenOMICC (Genetics of Mortality in Critical Care), have identified 16 new genetic variants that make a person more susceptible to a severe COVID-19 infection.  The GenOMICC— reportedly the largest of its kind — is a research study that brings together clinicians and scientists from around the world to find the genetic factors that lead to determine the outcome in critical illnesses. While millions suffer from infectious diseases every year, even though most cases are mild, some people become extremely unwell and need critical care. This may be because of their genes and the GenOMICC project is about identifying them. The scientists involved compare the DNA of critically-ill patients with members of the general population. However, ferreting out such differences requires a large number of people and comparing their genetic structures at multiple levels of resolution. Since 2015, the GenOMICC has been studying emerging infections such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), flu, sepsis, and other forms of critical illness.  Researchers from the GenOMICC consortium, led by the University of Edinburgh in partnership with Genomics England, sequenced the genomes of 7,491 patients from 224 intensive care units in the United Kingdom. Their DNA was compared with 48,400 other people who had not suffered from COVID-19, and that of a further 1,630 people who had experienced mild symptoms. Determining the whole genome sequence for all participants in the study allowed the team to create a precise map and identify genetic variation linked to severity of COVID-19.  The team found key differences in 16 genes in ICU patients compared to the DNA of the other groups. It also confirmed the involvement of seven other genetic variations already associated with severe COVID-19 discovered in earlier studies by the same team. The 16 new genetic variants included some that had a role in blood clotting, immune response and the intensity of inflammation. A single gene variant, the team found, disrupted a key messenger molecule in immune system signalling — called interferon alpha-10 — that increased a patient’s risk of severe disease. There were variations in genes that control the levels of a central component of blood clotting — known as Factor 8 — that were linked with critical illness in COVID-19. This highlights the gene’s key role in the immune system and suggests that treating patients with interferon, which are proteins released by immune cells to defend against viruses, may help manage disease in the early stages.  The overarching aim of genome association studies is to not only correlate genes but also design treatments. For instance, the knowledge that interferons play a role in mediating a severe infection is already being used in drug therapies in the management of severe COVID. A study called the COVIFERON trial tested three kinds of interferon on the management of severe COVID but found no significant benefit in alleviating disease. Genomics studies reveal an association with certain conditions but don’t necessarily explain how the genes direct the chain of chemical reactions that bring about an adverse outcome. But the knowledge of the gene helps to design targeted drugs. New technologies, such as CRISPR, allow genes to be tweaked or silenced and therefore this approach could be used to make new medicines. The GenOMICC study isn’t the only one of its kind. Several consortia globally are working on identifying genes that may explain different disease outcomes.

783,"March 12, 2022",18:33 IST,sci-tech,science,The search for the ‘cosmic dawn’ of first light is far from over," In a country of a billion phones, hungry for every bit of radio signal, is a group of scientists looking for spots where one can escape them. This continuing decade-long quest, led by scientists at the Raman Research Institute (RRI), Bengaluru has taken them multiple times to Ladakh, and to a place aptly named the Timbuktu Collective in Andhra Pradesh, and to lakes in northern Karnataka, with their radio telescope SARAS, which hopes to catch the trace of an extremely elusive sign from space — that of the birth of the first stars or what’s called “the cosmic dawn”. Harvard astronomer Abraham Loeb has remarked that the discovery of such a signal “would be worth two Nobel Prizes” because it would throw light on the structure of the universe in its infancy. Reverberations of the Big Bang that birthed our universe 13.8 billion years continue to linger in a swathe of radiation called the cosmic microwave background (CMB). At a very specific region in this spectrum, current cosmological models of the universe say, there’s a point where the microwave radiation is a little dim and this, these models say, is because light from the first stars may have made hydrogen extra opaque at specific radio wavelengths. Several groups around the world have designed custom-made, highly sensitive radio telescopes and are placing them in regions as remote as deserts in Australia to an island in the Antarctic ocean and, if a proposal comes through, in the lunar orbit. Ravi Subrahmanyan, former Director at the RRI, has led efforts since 2010 using the Shaped Antenna Measurement of the Background Radio Spectrum (SARAS), but an astounding 2018 result from an American group at the Arizona State University propelled several groups, including that of Dr. Subrahmanyan’s, to sharpen their quest. The EDGES telescope, or the Experiment to Detect the Global Epoch of Reionization Signature (EDGES) that was placed in an Australian desert, recorded an unusual signal that the group claims is the sign of the cosmic dawn. However the signal’s pattern wasn’t shaped in the way cosmological models predicted and since 2018, when the EDGES result was published, there’s a flurry of interpretation on whether the instrument actually detected the holy grail signal, and if it did, what explained its unusual structure. To test this, the RRI group made an updated version of SARAS, called SARAS-3. Its chief distinguishing characteristic is that, unlike other radio telescopes, it can be deployed on water bodies. The many layers of soil were themselves a source of radio wave contamination for ground based telescopes. Given that the purpose is to detect a highly elusive signal, water — being of uniform layers — would be an ideal medium, the group reckoned, to make such a sensitive measurement. In 2020, the radio telescope was deployed in lakes in northern Karnataka, on the Dandiganahalli lake and Sharavati backwaters, to detect the EDGES signal. Following weeks of observations and months of statistical analysis by Saurabh Singh, research scientist at the RRI, SARAS 3 did not find any evidence of the signal claimed by the EDGES experiment. The group’s paper in the journal Nature Astronomy noted that the “profile... is not of astrophysical origin... their best-fitting profile is rejected with 95.3% confidence... Our non-detection bears out earlier concerns and suggests that the profile found... is not evidence for new astrophysics or non-standard cosmology.” Dr. Singh told The Hindu that the quest for the signature was still on. Following the measurements on the lake, the group is planning to revisit Ladakh and place the telescope in one of the lakes there in the hope of improving their odds of detecting the signal.  In fact, it’s not just any lake but freshwater lakes that are a suitable candidate simply because salinity levels of the water in other lakes could also interfere with the readings. Ladakh’s lakes are by no means a final frontier, Dr. Singh said, as the team is open to prospect more sites — from northeastern India to the deserts of Rajasthan — in its quest. “There’s a lot unknown about how those early stars looked,” Dr. Singh said. “Actually, seeing the signal would reveal more about their composition and how the early universe looked.”",Jacob P Koshy,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/the-search-for-the-cosmic-dawn-of-first-light-is-far-from-over/article65217320.ece
784,"March 12, 2022",18:30 IST,sci-tech,science,A home-made analogy that helps study solar spicules in the lab," A team of interdisciplinary researchers from India and the U.K. led by astronomers from the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bengaluru, have explained the origin of ‘spicules’ on the Sun, using laboratory experiments as an analogy. The Sun, our closest star, continues to present us with numerous puzzles. One problem concerning the Sun that our astronomers are keen to study has to do with solar spicules. These are jets of plasma, shooting out from the Sun’s outermost layer – the Chromosphere – and making incursions into its atmosphere.  Many modellers have tried, but unsuccessfully, to match the size and abundance of these features, which play important roles in at least two deep problems in solar physics. Now, in the study, published in Nature Physics, these researchers have found a way to study spicules in the lab using an analogous system – paint is poured on the mouth of a speaker which is fed the music that causes it to break out in spicule-like jets! Solar spicules rise like forests from the Sun’s Chromosphere and pierce the Sun’s atmosphere or Corona. A typical spicule may be 4,000-12,000 kilometres long and 300-1,100 kilometres wide. These are structures that are believed to transport momentum to the solar wind and to provide heat to the solar Corona, which, intriguingly, can be a million degrees Celsius hotter than the Chromosphere.  The researchers found an analogous system in the most unlikely of places – a blob of paint dancing on the surface of the mouth of an audio speaker. Normally, if you place a liquid in a petri dish on the mouth of a speaker and turn up the frequency of the sound passing through it, at some frequency, the liquid’s free surface becomes unstable and starts vibrating. If the liquid is like paint or shampoo, instead of forming droplets, it will form long jets. This is because the fluid’s long polymeric chains give it a directionality.  “The spark came from our (then 8-year-old) daughter watching videos of paint dancing on a big (bass) speaker’s cone in slow-motion and commenting that they look like ‘your spicule videos’,” says Dr Piyali Chatterjee who is at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, in an email to The Hindu. She conveyed this to her collaborator and husband, Dr. O.V.S.N. Murthy, who is at the School of Arts and Sciences at Azim Premji University, Bengaluru, and an animated discussion followed in which they estimated that accelerations must be several times that of respective gravity values. Dr. Murthy started experimenting on iodinated poly vinyl alcohol (also used in photographic films) and poly-ethylene alcohol. Their observations convinced them that they were on the right track with the analogy. “Publish-worthy experiments were performed and filmed with a better camera, long-chain polyethylene oxide system, again, at home, while the disruption [due to lockdowns] continued, and we were able to set up simulations,” says Dr Chatterjee.  The researchers then did a simulation of the Sun’s surface and showed that a similar mechanism to what they used in the lab experiment can create spicules in the solar plasma. “Numerically driving a harmonic or Faraday-like excitation in plasma was something that we borrowed from the lab experiments,” says Dr. Chatterjee. The simulation showed them the strong similarity between the two systems. The simulation also matched the solar spicules quantitatively.  When asked about the fundamental questions that this method can answer, Dr. Chatterjee says the following: Trying to understand the origin and nature of solar spicules is of fundamental importance for not just Coronal heating but also mass supply to solar wind. The spicules are believed to act like channels to transport mass, momentum and energy to the Corona of the Sun. The team from the U.K. worked on data analysis from observations taken by the IRIS spacecraft and contributed advanced processing techniques, says Dr. Chatterjee, while she and her PhD student Sahel Dey did the simulations. Dr. Murthy designed and performed the experiments.",Shubashree Desikan,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/a-home-made-analogy-that-helps-study-solar-spicules-in-the-lab/article65217103.ece
785,"March 12, 2022",18:15 IST,sci-tech,science,Question Corner | How do damaged plants warn neighbours about herbivore attacks?,"  Animals often use highly specific signals to warn their herd about approaching predators. Surprisingly, a similar behaviour is also observed in plants. Shedding more light on this phenomenon, Tokyo University of Science researchers have discovered one such mechanism. Using Arabidopsis thaliana as a model system, the researchers have shown that herbivore-damaged plants give off volatile chemical ‘scents’ that trigger epigenetic modifications in the defence genes of neighbouring plants. These genes subsequently trigger anti-herbivore defence systems. Prior studies have shown that when grown near mint plants, soybean and field mustard (Brassica rapa) plants display heightened defence properties against herbivore pests by activating defence genes in their leaves, as a result of ""eavesdropping"" on mint volatiles. Put simply, if mint leaves get damaged after a herbivore attack, the plants in their immediate vicinity respond by activating their anti-herbivore defence systems in response to the chemical signals released by the damaged mint plant. To understand this mechanism better, a team led by Tokyo University of Science, studied these responses in Arabidopsis thaliana, a model plant used widely in biological studies (Plant Physiology). First, researchers exposed the plants to beta-ocimene, a volatile organic compound often released by plants in response to attacks by herbivores like Spodoptera litura. Next, the researchers tried to determine the exact mechanism of action of volatile-chemical-activated plant defence. They found that the volatile chemicals released by the damaged plants enhanced histone acetylation and the expression of defence gene regulators. The team found a specific set of enzymes were responsible for the induction and maintenance of the anti-herbivore properties, a press release says.",The Hindu Bureau,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/plant-warning-system/article65217098.ece
787,"March 12, 2022",18:00 IST,sci-tech,science,What causes the interrupted sleep of the elderly?," A common human wish is to be able to sleep like a baby. Indeed, in adults, the total hours of sleep, and the quality of this sleep declines with age. Older people are especially prone to listless, fragmented sleep. A chronic drop in the quality and quantity of sleep can lead to diminished mental and physical health, and to a reduced lifespan (Mander et al., Neuron, 94, 19 (2017)). Research has provided many clues to what induces sleep in humans. The pineal gland, at night, releases the hormone melatonin which is involved in regulating the sleep-wake cycle. This has made it a popular supplement for overcoming insomnia, although its effectiveness beyond the short term remains debatable. However, our ‘awake’ state is much more complex, because nearly the whole brain is involved. This is perhaps why we are perplexed by the often-disrupted sleep of the elderly, where wakefulness repeatedly encroaches upon blissful sleep. It is known that in older people with sleep disturbances, degeneration of nerve cells is seen in brain centres involved in the coordination of voluntary movements. A recent study has added a new dimension to our knowledge (Li et al., Science, 375, 2022). The study points to the hypothalamus, which lies in the centre of the brain and is the size and shape of an almond. An area in this part of the brain, the lateral hypothalamus, plays an outsized role in wakefulness, feeding behaviour, learning and sleep. Emanating from here are a bunch of nerve cells that fan out and project their nerve ending to all the parts of the central nervous system that are associated with the state of arousal. The chemical message released by these neurons is in the form of small proteins, called hypocretins and also known as orexins (The two names come from two groups of scientists who independently discovered these neuropeptides in 1998). Like all neurons, Hcrt/OX neurons have endings called synapses, which may be next to the synapse of another neuron, or next to a muscle cell. Electrical signals pass along the length of neurons until they come to the synapse, where they are fleetingly transformed into chemical signals, which cross over and generate a response in the adjacent neuron. In the language of neuroscience, an excitatory signal will lead to the firing of the next neuron – electrical signals are conducted to a synapse at the other end of that neuron. Inhibitory signals tamp down the firing of an active neuron. Hypocretin tends to be excitatory, stimulating the neurons that it reaches. Hypocretin stimulates wakefulness, and with it, motivated behaviour such as seeking food or a mate, as well as responsiveness to cold, nausea or pain. Of the 86 billion neurons in the human brain, less than 20,000 produce hypocretin, but their influence is profound. Most of all, hypocretin is important for maintaining prolonged periods of wakefulness. Directly injecting hypocretin into the cerebrospinal fluid (so that it is quickly delivered inside the brain) will keep you wide-awake for several hours. And neurons that produce hypocretin are no longer active when you are asleep. In experiments, mice deprived of food stay awake and busy for a very long time while they search for food. Mice lacking hypocretin, in which the hypocretin gene has been knocked out, are far less motivated in their hunt. What happens to the sleep of the elderly? Li et al. show that with age, changes occur in these hypocretin-producing neurons. They become hyperexcitable, conducting signals and releasing neuropeptides at a very low threshold, at the slightest provocation. The unwanted activation of inactive hypocretin neurons leads to the fractionation of sleep. Changes in aged neurons thus make it more difficult to inhibit their activity. There is a rare disorder of the nervous system triggered by the loss of Hcrt/OX neurons. Narcolepsy has strange characteristics – an overwhelming desire to sleep in the daytime, even though the total hours of sleep remain unchanged; a tendency to hallucinate as the sleep-wake phases are blurred; frequent loss of muscle tone – cataplexy – during which muscles become flaccid. Only a handful of cases have been documented in India, mostly men in their thirties (Ray, Indian Journal of Medical Research, 148, 748 (2018)). Patients with this condition have vanishingly low amounts of hypocretin in their cerebrospinal fluids.  Finally, can sufferers of fractured sleep dream of ways to bring better constancy to their sleep? In aged mice, the analgesic Flupirtine, although beset with toxicity issues, appears to raise back the threshold at which hypocretin neurons get excited, thus restoring the structure of sleep.

788,"March 11, 2022",10:45 IST,sci-tech,science,What do we know about the newest crater on the moon?," The story so far: A leftover piece of a spacecraft flying through space reportedly hit the surface of the moon last Friday, creating a new crater that may be around 65 feet wide. The piece of space junk was earlier believed to be a SpaceX rocket, but was later said to be the third-stage booster of Chang'e 5-T1 – a lunar mission launched by the China National Space Administration in 2014. China, however, denied responsibility, saying that the booster in question had ""safely entered the earth's atmosphere and was completely incinerated"", news agency AFP reported. According to orbital calculations, the collision took place on March 4 at 5.55 p.m. IST on the far side of the moon. The object reportedly weighs around four tonnes and was racing towards the moon at a speed of 9,300 km an hour. The speed, trajectory, and time of impact were calculated using earth-based telescope observations.  American astronomer Bill Gray was the first to predict the collision. In January 2022, Gray had said that a booster from a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket was likely to hit the moon after seven years of floating in space. Gray later corrected his prediction, saying that the space junk was part of a Chinese lunar mission and not from SpaceX.  Gray runs Project Pluto, a blog that tracks near-earth objects. Project Pluto also supplies astronomical software to amateur and professional astronomers. Gray is the creator of popular astronomy software called Guide.  The astronomer explained the process of ascertaining the date and time of the collision in a blog post on Project Pluto. He informed that the object was first spotted during an asteroid survey in 2015 and was believed to be a part of the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) satellite that was launched by SpaceX on Falcon 9 rocket on February 11, 2015.  Gray continued to track the object, and after analysing data that came in from nine different observatories in January 2022, he was able to improve the accuracy of the object’s trajectory and give a confident prediction of the date and time of the object’s collision with the surface of the moon.  The astronomer has also said that this is the first recorded unintentional case of space junk hitting the moon.  According to Gray, an email from Jon Giorgini of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California made him retrace the trajectory of DSCOVR, and it was seen that the SpaceX spacecraft did not go close to the moon. “It would be a little strange if the second stage went right past the moon, while DSCOVR was in another part of the sky. There's always some separation, but this was suspiciously large,” Gray wrote on his blog.  The astronomer then studied the trajectory of the object backwards, and discovered a lunar flyby on October 28, 2014. The Chang'e 5-T1 mission was launched on October 23, 2014, providing evidence that the object was indeed a leftover from the same mission.  A team at the University of Arizona also studied the object and confirmed that it resembles the Chinese rocket and not that of SpaceX.  NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and ISRO’s Chandrayaan-2 orbiter are two active lunar missions that are capable of observing the crater and picturing it. The location of the impact – on the far side of the moon – has made it difficult for the crater to be pictured and studied immediately.  Both the earth and the moon have been hit by multiple objects like asteroids throughout their existence, but craters on the moon are of a more permanent nature than those on earth. This is because of processes like erosion, tectonics, and volcanism. According to NASA, these three processes keep the surface of the earth crater-free and remove traces of collisions that have happened in the past. Currently, the earth has less than 200 known craters while the moon has thousands.  An absence of atmosphere means there is no wind system and no weather on the moon, and hence no cause for erosion of existing craters. Absence of tectonics prevents the moon’s surface from forming new rocks, or causing a shift in the existing surface patterns, unlike that on earth. Lastly, absence of volcanism makes it impossible for craters to be covered.

David Bennett, 57, died on March 8 at the University of Maryland Medical Center. Doctors didn’t give an exact cause of death, saying only that his condition had begun deteriorating several days earlier. Mr. Bennett's son praised the hospital for offering the last-ditch experiment, saying the family hoped it would help further efforts to end the organ shortage. “We are grateful for every innovative moment, every crazy dream, every sleepless night that went into this historic effort,” David Bennett Jr. said in a statement released by the University of Maryland School of Medicine. “We hope this story can be the beginning of hope and not the end.” Doctors for decades have sought to one day use animal organs for life-saving transplants. Bennett, a handyman from Hagerstown, Maryland, was a candidate for this newest attempt only because he otherwise faced certain death — ineligible for a human heart transplant, bedridden and on life support, and out of other options.  After the January 7 operation, Mr. Bennett's son told The Associated Press his father knew there was no guarantee it would work.  Prior attempts at such transplants — or xenotransplantation — have failed largely because patients’ bodies rapidly rejected the animal organ. This time, the Maryland surgeons used a heart from a gene-edited pig: Scientists had modified the animal to remove pig genes that trigger the hyper-fast rejection and add human genes to help the body accept the organ. At first the pig heart was functioning, and the Maryland hospital issued periodic updates that Mr. Bennett seemed to be slowly recovering. In February 2022, the hospital released video of him watching the Super Bowl from his hospital bed while working with his physical therapist. Mr. Bennett survived significantly longer with the gene-edited pig heart than one of the last milestones in xenotransplantation — when Baby Fae, a dying California infant, lived 21 days with a baboon's heart in 1984. “We are devastated by the loss of Mr. Bennett. He proved to be a brave and noble patient who fought all the way to the end,” Dr. Bartley Griffith, who performed the surgery at the Baltimore hospital, said in a statement. The need for another source of organs is huge. More than 41,000 transplants were performed in the U.S. last year, a record — including about 3,800 heart transplants. But more than 106,000 people remain on the national waiting list, thousands die every year before getting an organ and thousands more never even get added to the list, considered too much of a long shot. The Food and Drug Administration had allowed the dramatic Maryland experiment under “compassionate use” rules for emergency situations. Bennett’s doctors said he had heart failure and an irregular heartbeat, plus a history of not complying with medical instructions. He was deemed ineligible for a human heart transplant that requires strict use of immune-suppressing medicines, or the remaining alternative, an implanted heart pump.  Doctors didn't reveal the exact cause of Mr. Bennett's death. Rejection, infection and other complications are risks for transplant recipients. But from Mr. Bennett's experience, ""we have gained invaluable insights learning that the genetically modified pig heart can function well within the human body while the immune system is adequately suppressed”, said Dr. Muhammad Mohiuddin, scientific director of the Maryland university’s animal-to-human transplant programme. One next question is whether scientists have learned enough from Mr. Bennett's experience and some other recent experiments with gene-edited pig organs to persuade the FDA to allow a clinical trial — possibly with an organ such as a kidney that isn’t immediately fatal if it fails. Twice last year, surgeons at New York University got permission from the families of deceased individuals to temporarily attach a gene-edited pig kidney to blood vessels outside the body and watch them work before ending life support. And surgeons at the University of Alabama at Birmingham went a step further, transplanting a pair of gene-edited pig kidneys into a brain-dead man in a step-by-step rehearsal for an operation they hope to try in living patients possibly later this year. Pigs have long been used in human medicine, including pig skin grafts and implantation of pig heart valves. But transplanting entire organs is much more complex than using highly processed tissue. The gene-edited pigs used in these experiments were provided by Revivicor, a subsidiary of United Therapeutics, one of several biotech companies in the running to develop suitable pig organs for potential human transplant.",AP,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/us-man-who-got-first-pig-heart-transplant-dies-two-months-after-surgery/article65208441.ece
792,"March 08, 2022",18:48 IST,sci-tech,science,Chandrayaan-2 makes first observations of distribution of Argon-40 in Moon’s atmosphere,"  The Chandra's Atmospheric Composition Explorer-2 (CHACE-2), a quadrupole mass spectrometer onboard Chandrayaan-2 mission, has made the first-of-its-kind observations of the global distribution of Argon-40 in the tenuous lunar exosphere, according to the Indian Space Research Organisation. These observations provide insight on the dynamics of the lunar exospheric species, as well as on the radiogenic activities in the first few tens of metres below the lunar surface, the Bengaluru-headquartered space agency said in a statement on Tuesday. 'Exosphere' is the outermost region of the upper atmosphere of a celestial body where the constituent atoms and molecules rarely collide with each other and can escape into space. Earth's Moon features a surface-boundary-exosphere. For Moon, different constituents in the exosphere are fed from the surface by a variety of processes, such as thermal desorption, solar wind sputtering, photo-stimulated desorption, and micrometeorite impact vaporisation. The exospheric atoms may be lost to space by the thermal escape (also known as the Jean's escape). Also, the atoms get ionised by photo-ionisation and charge exchange with the solar wind ions. Subsequently, they can be swept away by the convective electric field of the solar wind. Some of these atoms/ions can also be deposited back on the lunar surface. Thus, the lunar exosphere exists as a result of a dynamic equilibrium between several source and sink processes. Noble gases serve as important tracers to understand the processes of surface-exosphere interaction, and Argon-40 (Ar-40) is such an important tracer atom to study the dynamics of the lunar exospheric species, the statement said. Ar-40 originates from the radioactive disintegration of Potassium-40 (K-40) present below the lunar surface. Once formed, it diffuses through the inter-granular space and makes way up to the lunar exosphere through seepages and faults. The CHACE-2 observations provide the diurnal and spatial variation of Ar-40 covering the equatorial and mid latitude regions of the Moon, according to ISRO. ""The uniqueness of this result from Chandrayaan-2 mission lies in the fact that although Apollo-17 and LADEE missions have detected the presence of Ar-40 in the lunar exosphere, the measurements were confined to the near-equatorial region of the Moon,"" it said. ""As there is a steep latitudinal temperature gradient of the lunar surface, it was, so far, a gap area to study the global dynamics of the lunar exospheric species, which is a temperature-driven process. In this context, the observations by CHACE-2 onboard Chandrayaan-2 orbiter on Ar-40 up to the mid-latitude regions [−60º to +60º] play a significant role to bridge the gap in the knowledge,"" the space agency said. CHACE-2 observations reveal an increase in the number density of Ar-40 near the sunrise terminator, a decrease through the dayside, a secondary peak near sunset terminator and a night-side minima. This is the typical behaviour of a condensable gas, it was stated. For the mid latitude regions, CHACE-2 observations showed for the first time that the variation in the number density of Ar-40 with respect to solar longitudes are similar to that of low latitude regions, despite the differences in temperature and topography. Further, the CHACE-2 observations reveal that the distribution in Ar-40 has significant spatial heterogeneity. There are localised enhancements (termed as Argon bulge) over several regions including the KREEP [potassium (K), rare-earth elements, and phosphorus (P)] and South Pole Aitken terrain. The observations of Argon bulge by CHACE-2 are indicative of unknown or additional loss processes, Moon quakes or regions with lower activation energies, which call for a better understanding of the surface-exosphere interactions and source distributions of Ar-40, the statement said. CHACE-2 was a sequel to the CHACE experiment on the Moon Impact Probe (MIP) of Chandrayaan-1 mission and also draws heritage from the Mars Exospheric Neutral Composition Analyser (MENCA) experiment aboard the Indian Mars Orbiter Mission, it was noted.",PTI,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/chandrayaan-2-makes-first-observations-of-distribution-of-argon-40-in-moons-atmosphere/article65204670.ece
793,"March 08, 2022",11:03 IST,sci-tech,science,Gene-edited beef cattle get regulatory clearance in U.S.,"  U.S. regulators on Monday cleared the way for the sale of beef from gene-edited cattle in coming years after the Food and Drug Administration concluded the animals do not raise any safety concerns. The cattle by Recombinetics are the third genetically altered animals given the green light for human consumption in the U.S. after salmon and pigs. Many other foods already are made with genetically modified ingredients from crops like soybeans and corn. The cattle reviewed by the FDA had genes altered with a technology called CRISPR to have short, slick coats that let them more easily withstand hot weather. Cattle that aren’t stressed by heat might pack on weight more easily, making for more efficient meat production.  The company did not say when home cooks or restaurants might be able to buy the beef, but the FDA said it could reach the market in as early as two years. Unlike the salmon and pigs, the cattle did not have to go through a yearslong approval process. The FDA said the cattle were exempt from that because their genetic makeup is similar to other existing cattle and the trait can be found naturally in some breeds. Dr. Steven Solomon, director of the FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine, said the agency’s review of Recombinetics' cattle took several months. He said there’s no reason meat from the animals or their offspring would need to be labeled differently. Solomon said a genetically altered animal marketed as having a special advantage — such a higher than normal ability to withstand heat — might need to go through the full approval process. “This opens up a completely different pathway,” he said, noting the decision could be encouraging for other biotech companies, many of which are small startups. The gene-edited trait in the Recombinetics cattle can be passed down so semen and embryos from them could be used to produce offspring with the same shorter coats. The trait will make beef production more sustainable and to improve animal welfare in warmer climates, Recombinetics said in a statement without providing further details. Greg Jaffe, who specializes in biotechnology at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said the FDA’s announcement made clear it wasn't exempting all gene-edited animals from the longer approval process. “They reinforce the idea that this is a case-by-case review,” Mr. Jaffe said. He said the agency should be more transparent about the review process so people know what's in the works. That could lead to better public acceptance and minimize any potential economic disruptions from global trade, since other countries might consider the animals genetically modified foods that need to be labeled, he said. Jaydee Hanson, of the Center for Food Safety, said the agency should keep track of the animals for several generations to ensure there aren’t any unintended issues. The genetically modified pig is intended mainly for medical purposes, not meat, according to the company that developed it. The firm recently provided a pig heart that was transplanted into a dying man in an experimental surgery. The company behind the modified salmon said the fish are being sold to distributors in the Midwest and Northeast. Alison Van Eenennaam, an animal geneticist at University of California, Davis who has worked with Recombinetics, said requiring all companies to go through the lengthy approval process could end the possibility of commercializing gene-edited animals in the U.S. For the gene-edited cattle cleared by the FDA, she said it could take about two years for beef from the offspring to reach the market.  Once the semen is used to create embryos, she said gestation would take about nine months and the resulting calves might be slaughtered after about 10 months. She noted the market isn’t limited to the U.S., given the way cattle are bred.",AP,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/gene-edited-beef-cattle-get-regulatory-clearance-in-us/article65203693.ece
794,"March 06, 2022",22:32 IST,sci-tech,science,Migratory waterbirds: Encouraging trend of species diversity recorded," The unconducive weather conditions in January and early February of 2022 may have made it difficult for the bird lovers this season to conveniently sight the winter migratory waterbirds, which make their way to different wetlands of Punjab and other parts of the country through the central Asian flyway. But an encouraging trend of waterbirds and species diversity has been observed from the wetlands. Every winter, the birds make their way to India through the central Asian flyway, which covers a large continental area of Europe–Asia between the Arctic and the Indian Oceans. Every year, the Wildlife Department of Forests and Wildlife Preservation, Punjab, conducts waterbirds census exercise in six major and most biodiverse wetlands, which include the Nangal Wildlife Sanctuary, the Ropar Conservation Reserve, the Harike Wildlife Sanctuary, the Kanjli Wetland, the Keshopur-Miani Community Reserve and the Ranjit Sagar Conservation Reserve. Hhowever, the census could not be done this year on account of dense fog conditions. Instead a “species richness” survey was conducted by the Department of Forests and Wildlife Preservation with the support from the WWF-India. R.K. Mishra, Chief Wildlife  Warden, said a promising trend of waterbirds and species diversity has been observed from the wetlands of Pathankot and Gurdaspur district as the marshlands are full of water due to good rains and good flow into the Ravi river. “Flocks of northern lapwings numbering up to 191 were observed in Gurdaspur wetlands which are higher in comparison to the previous three years’ average of 105. Similarly, 655 common cranes were recorded this year which is higher in comparison to the previous three years’ average of 555,” he told The Hindu. Pointing out that 91 species of waterbirds were recorded from the six protected wetlands during the waterbird species richness survey, Gitanjali Kanwar, Coordinator — Rivers, Wetlands and Water Policy, WWF–India said: “The waterbird count was highest in the Harike Wildlife Sanctuary followed by the Keshopur–Miani Community Reserve, Ropar Conservation Reserve and Nangal Wildlife Sanctuary.  “Like previous years, the Harike Wildlife Sanctuary hosted the largest congregation and diversity of waterbirds whereas wetlands like Keshopur–Miani and Shallpattan are the only wetlands in Punjab to host the migratory population of common crane and resident population of the Sarus crane. The Ropar and Nangal wetlands host the three migratory water species of the family Podicipedidae i.e., black-necked Grebe, Horned Grebe and Greater Crested Grebe along with the resident Little Grebe. “The year 2022 has been very difficult and challenging in relation to conducting the waterbird census exercise in wetlands of Punjab. The peak migratory bird season overlapped with the outbreak of the third wave of COVID-19 pandemic. Also, an unusually severe cold wave engulfed northern India in January and early February 2022 making an unconducive situation because of intermittent rains and dense fog for assessing the wetlands and conducting the field survey for waterbirds.  “However, before the onset of the reverse migration of the waterbirds, it was decided to conduct a waterbird ‘species richness’ survey in February 2022.” She said, “The species of high conservation significance recorded during the survey include Bonelli’s Eagle, Greater Spotted Eagle, Northern Lapwing, Peregrine Falcon, Steppe Eagle, Western Black-tailed Godwit, Black-headed Ibis, Sarus Crane, Painted Stork, Woolly-necked Stork, Common Pochard, Common Crane, Ferruginous Pochard, Pallid Harrier, River Tern, Indian Spotted Eagle, River Lapwing, Oriental Darter, and Eurasian Curlew,” Ms. Kanwar said the Eurasian Coot was one of the most common waterbirds spotted in almost all protected wetlands of Punjab during the survey.  “The Eurasian Coot also forms one of the highest densities among all the waterbirds recorded from Nangal, Ropar, Harike, Keshopur–Miani and Kanjli wetland followed by Gadwall and Common Teal,” she said.",Vikas Vasudeva,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/migratory-waterbirds-encouraging-trend-of-species-diversity-recorded/article65198183.ece
795,"March 05, 2022",20:07 IST,sci-tech,science,Variants do not always evolve to become less virulent," In early February, World Health Organization technical lead on Covid-19, Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, cautioned that the pandemic is far from over and new variants will emerge and such variants could be more transmissible than the Omicron BA.2 variant. “The next variant of concern will be more fit, and what we mean by that is it will be more transmissible because it will have to overtake what is currently circulating. The big question is whether or not future variants will be more or less severe,” Dr Van Kerkhove said. The only way the next variant can become even more transmissible than the Omicron variant is by exhibiting a far higher ability to evade neutralising antibodies. This would mean that full vaccinations (two doses) will be even less effective in preventing breakthrough infections. But so far, fully vaccinated people have been found to be less likely to suffer from severe disease requiring hospitalisation and even death. That is because it is the T cells and B cells that come into play to reduce the severity of the disease. “The memory T cells are extremely unlikely to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections. That is just not what T cells generally do. They may reduce COVID-19 disease severity and prevent deaths,” Dr. Shane Crotty from La Jolla Institute for Immunology, La Jolla, California, had earlier told The Hindu. “The variants are a wild card. We still don’t know everything about this virus, we still don’t know everything about the variants and the future trajectory of that,” Dr. Van Kherkhove added.  While the next variant has to necessarily be more infectious than the Omicron variant, whether the variant will be more or less severe cannot be said with certainty. But it is important to remember that right from the very early stage of the pandemic, it became clear that transmission or virus spread begins even before symptoms can show up. That is what makes SARS-CoV-2 very different from the 2002 SARS virus and MERS virus. Since transmission begins even before symptoms set in and well before the disease becomes severe, the transmission characteristic is decoupled from disease. As a result, the natural evolution process selects variants not based on how they cause disease but how they can escape neutralising antibodies.  “Almost all [SARS-CoV-2] transmission happens while people have no or few symptoms, there is no particular reason for severity to play a role in evolutionary selection. NERVTAG [The New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group] thinks Omicron's mildness is likely pure chance and the next one is likely to be more severe again,” Dr William P. Hanage from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Boston, tweeted. The virus was novel and none in the world had any immunity in the beginning of the pandemic. But with millions being infected by the virus and millions being fully vaccinated, and some with a combination of natural infection and vaccination, the next variant has to necessarily exhibit higher immune escape to cause infection. This is the reason that the next variant will exhibit more immune escape than the Omicron variant. Even though the Omicron variant caused a large number of infections in virus-naïve people and in those who have been previously infected and vaccinated, at the population level, disease severity has been far less severe compared with the Delta variant. But lower disease severity was seen more in people who have pre-existing immunity either from vaccination or previous infection.  Two studies that tried to document the intrinsic disease severity of the Omicron variant compared it with the Delta variant. The studies found that the Omicron variant is about 75% as likely to cause severe disease or death as the delta variant. In a study posted as a preprint in medRxiv on January 12, this year, the authors conclude: “In the Omicron-driven wave, severe COVID-19 outcomes were reduced mostly due to protection conferred by prior infection and/or vaccination, but intrinsically reduced virulence may account for an approximately 25% reduced risk of severe hospitalization or death compared to Delta.” In the second study, a report by the Imperial College COVID-19 response team found 69% reduction in hospitalisation risk in people who have been reinfected compared with primary cases.  “This meaningful but fairly small difference implies that Omicron, Alpha, and wild-type SARS-CoV-2 have similar intrinsic severity,” Dr Roby P. Bhattacharyya from Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston and Dr William P. Hanage from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Boston write in The New England Journal of Medicine. “Viruses don’t inevitably evolve toward being less virulent; evolution simply selects those that excel at multiplying. In the case of COVID-19, in which the vast majority of transmission occurs before disease becomes severe, reduced severity may not be directly selected for at all,” Dr. Bhattacharyya and Dr. Hanage write. “Indeed, previous SARS-CoV-2 variants with enhanced transmissibility (e.g., Alpha and Delta) appear to have greater intrinsic severity than their immediate ancestors or the previously dominant variant.” “It is also not true that variants are becoming milder. Delta was more severe than Alpha which was more severe than the original [virus]. Omicron is milder than Delta but likely not milder than original [virus]... and it’s not part of a steady progression to mildness.,” Dr. Hanage tweeted. Just like how transmission is decoupled from disease severity for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it is also true that the new variants have not evolved from the existing ones. “Thus far, new variants of concern have not evolved from the dominant preceding one. Instead, they have emerged from separate lineages,” says a report in Nature. Dr. William Hanage, too, says the same in a tweet: “[SARS-CoV-2] evolves rapidly, but this isn't straightforward. None of the main variants evolved from each other. Instead, so far they are all distinct, becoming gradually fitter via subvariants until replaced by an entirely new variant.”",R.

797,"March 05, 2022",19:11 IST,sci-tech,science,Question corner | Is there a link between alcohol consumption and brain volume?," The science on heavy drinking and the brain is clear. The two don’t have a healthy relationship. People who drink heavily have alterations in brain structure and size that are associated with cognitive impairments. But according to a new study, alcohol consumption even at levels most would consider modest — a few beers or glasses of wine a week — may also carry risks to the brain. An analysis of data from more than 36,000 adults, led by a team from the University of Pennsylvania, found that light-to-moderate alcohol consumption was associated with reductions in overall brain volume. The link grew stronger the greater the level of alcohol consumption, the researchers showed. As an example, in 50-year-olds, as average drinking among individuals increases from one alcohol unit (about half a beer) a day to two units (a pint of beer or a glass of wine) there are associated changes in the brain equivalent to ageing two years. Going from two to three alcohol units at the same age was like aging three and a half years. The team reported their findings in the journal  Nature Communications. Going from zero to one alcohol units didn’t make much of a difference in brain volume, but going from one to two or two to three units a day was associated with reductions in both grey and white matter, according to University of Pennsylvania release. Ample research has examined the link between drinking and brain health, with ambiguous results. While strong evidence exists that heavy drinking causes changes in brain structure, including strong reductions in grey and white matter across the brain, other studies have suggested that moderate levels of alcohol consumption may not have an impact, or even that light drinking could benefit the brain in older adults.",Staff Reporter,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/question-corner-is-there-a-link-between-alcohol-consumption-and-brain-volume/article65192942.ece

Hopfield chosen for the Boltzmann medal," Deepak Dhar, physicist, from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune, has been selected for the Boltzmann medal, awarded by the Commission on Statistical Physics (C3) of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics. He becomes the first Indian to win this award, which was initiated in 1975, with Nobel laureate (1982) K.G. Wilson being the first recipient. He shares the platform with American scientist John J. Hopfield who is known for his invention of an associative neural network, now named after him. The award consists of the gilded Boltzmann medal with the inscription of Ludwig Boltzmann, and the chosen two scientists will be presented the medals at the StatPhys28 conference to be held in Tokyo, 7-11 August, 2023.  Prof. Dhar, who was formerly at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai, has been chosen for this award for his seminal contributions in the field of statistical physics, including exact solutions of self-organised criticality models, interfacial growth, universal long-time relaxation in disordered magnetic systems, exact solutions in percolation and cluster counting problems and definition of spectral dimension of fractals, according to the website of the C3 Commission.  It is noteworthy that the last item, namely, the definition of the spectral dimension of fractals, relates to the work he did as a PhD student at California Institute of Technology, in the U.S. The award, in effect, marks out his lifetime’s achievement. Prof Gautam Menon, who has worked with Prof. Dhar says on Twitter, “He was my post-doctoral mentor at TIFR. I can think of no-one who deserves this more.” He goes on to say that Mark Kac, who pioneered the development of mathematical probability and its application to statistical physics, once said, “There are two kinds of geniuses, the ‘ordinary’ and the ‘magicians’. An ordinary genius is the fellow that you and I would be just as good as, if we were only many times better… once we understand what they have done, we feel that we too could have done it. It is different with the magicians. Even after we understand what they have done, the process by which they have done it is completely mysterious.” Prof Menon says, then, “Deepak is a magician.” The Statistical Physics community celebrated the occasion of Prof Dhar and Prof. Mustansir Barma, who is at TIFR, Hyderabad centre now, turning 70, recently. The members of this group number more than a hundred today, and the contribution of Prof. Dhar and Prof. Barma in building up this community by nurturing the talents with schools and mentorship, has been appreciated and noted by physicists. However, both scientists independently said that they had not done this consciously and were happy at the outcome.  The medal, which honours outstanding achievements in the field of statistical physics, has been given to one or two persons, once in three years, in the last 47 years. Previous winners include K.G. Wilson, R. Kubo, M.E. Fisher, R.J. Baxter, Kurt Binder, Giorgio Parisi, L. P. Kadanoff and other such names which to be found in the textbooks of statistical physics and many of whom have later won the Nobel prize. It is given only once to a person and on the condition that that person has not won the Nobel prize so far.

799,"March 03, 2022",04:45 IST,sci-tech,science,"Space junk on 5,800-mph collision course with moon","  Cape Canaveral The moon is about to get walloped by 3 tons of space junk, a punch that will carve out a crater that could fit several semitractor-trailers.  The leftover rocket will smash into the far side of the moon at 5,800 mph (9,300 kph) on March 4, away from telescopes’ prying eyes.  It may take weeks, even months, to confirm the impact through satellite images.  It’s been tumbling haphazardly through space, experts believe, since China launched it nearly a decade ago.
But Chinese officials are dubious it’s theirs.  No matter whose it is, scientists expect the object to carve out a hole 33 feet to 66 feet (10 to 20 metres) across and send moon dust flying hundreds of miles (kilometres) across the barren, pockmarked surface.  Low-orbiting space junk is relatively easy to track.  Objects launching deeper into space are unlikely to hit anything and these far-flung pieces are usually soon forgotten, except by a handful of observers who enjoy playing celestial detective on the side.  SpaceX originally took the rap for the upcoming lunar litter after asteroid tracker Bill Gray identified the collision course in January.
He corrected himself a month later, saying the “mystery” object was not a SpaceX Falcon rocket upper stage from the 2015 launch of a deep space climate observatory for NASA.  Mr. Gray said it was likely the third stage of a Chinese rocket that sent a test sample capsule to the moon and back in 2014. But Chinese ministry officials said the upper stage had reentered Earth’s atmosphere and burned up.  But there were two Chinese missions with similar designations — the test flight and 2020’s lunar sample return mission — and U.S. observers believe the two are getting mixed up.  The U.S. Space Command, which tracks lower space junk, confirmed on Tuesday that the Chinese upper stage from the 2014 lunar mission never deorbited, as previously indicated in its database. But it could not confirm the country of origin for the object about to strike the moon.  “We focus on objects closer to the Earth,” a spokesperson said in a statement.  Mr. Gray, a mathematician and physicist, said he’s confident now that it’s China’s rocket.  “I’ve become a little bit more cautious of such matters,” he said. “But I really just don’t see any way it could be anything else.” Jonathan McDowell of the Harvard and Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics supports Mr. Gray’s revised assessment, but notes, “The effect will be the same. It’ll leave yet another small crater on the moon.” The moon already bears countless craters, ranging up to 1,600 miles (2,500 kilometres). With little to no real atmosphere, the moon is defenceless against the constant barrage of meteors and asteroids, and the occasional incoming spacecraft, including a few intentionally crashed for science’s sake. With no weather, there’s no erosion and so impact craters last forever.  China has a lunar lander on the moon’s far side, but it will be too far away to detect Friday’s impact just north of the equator. NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter will also be out of range. It’s unlikely India’s moon-orbiting Chandrayaan-2 will be passing by then, either.  “I had been hoping for something (significant) to hit the moon for a long time. Ideally, it would have hit on the near side of the moon at some point where we could actually see it,” Mr. Gray said.  After initially pinning the upcoming strike on Elon Musk’s SpaceX, Mr. Gray took another look after an engineer at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory questioned his claim. Now, he’s “pretty thoroughly persuaded” it’s a Chinese rocket part, based not only on orbital tracking back to its 2014 liftoff, but also data received from its short-lived ham radio experiment.  JPL’s Center for Near Earth Object Studies endorses Mr. Gray’s reassessment. A University of Arizona team also recently identified the Chinese Long March rocket segment from the light reflected off its paint, during telescope observations of the careening cylinder.  It’s about 40 feet (12 metres) long and 10 feet (3 metres) in diameter, and doing a somersault every two to three minutes.
Mr. Gray said SpaceX never contacted him to challenge his original claim. Neither have the Chinese.  “It’s not a SpaceX problem, nor is it a China problem. Nobody is particularly careful about what they do with junk at this sort of orbit,” Mr. Gray said.  Tracking deep space mission leftovers like this is hard, according to Mr. McDowell. The moon’s gravity can alter an object’s path during flybys, creating uncertainty. And there’s no readily available database, Mr. McDowell noted, aside from the ones “cobbled together” by himself, Mr. Gray and a couple others.  “We are now in an era where many countries and private companies are putting stuff in deep space, so it’s time to start to keep track of it,” Mr. McDowell said. “Right now there’s no one, just a few fans in their spare time.” ",AP,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/space-junk-on-5800-mph-collision-course-with-moon/article65185274.ece
800,"March 03, 2022",04:07 IST,sci-tech,science,Next COVID-19 wave can’t be predicted: experts," Independent experts have criticised a recent modelling study from a group of researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur that predicts a fourth COVID wave in India around June. The study, uploaded on the preprint server, Medrxiv, which hosts scientific work that is yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal forecasts the wave to begin precisely on June 22, 2022, reaching its peak on August 23, 2022 and ending on October 24, 2022. For its analysis, it takes the trajectory of the coronavirus epidemic in Zimbabwe, because its history most resembles the case trend in India, and concludes that because Zimbabwe has seen a fourth wave, India is a fait accompli. The authors, Sabara Parshad Rajeshbhai, Subhra Sankar Dhar and Shalabh, of the Department of Statistics and Mathematics, IIT-K, add caveats that the future wave could be affected by the nature of the existing variant that would emerge as well as vaccination coverage. The Hindu could not immediately reach out to the authors for comment. “The findings from this study are aimed to help and sensitise the people. For example, a few countries including the Government of India have started to provide booster dose to a section of people, which may reduce the impact of the fourth wave in a long run,” their paper notes. A group at IIT Kanpur, led by Manindra Agrawal, a professor of mathematics and computer science, is behind the SUTRA model, whose forecasts on the pandemic are widely followed. While this model failed to forecast the deadly second wave and was critiqued by epidemiologists and biologists for its approach, it was accurate at gauging the trajectory of the third wave. The latest study is however independent of the SUTRA model. Mr. Agrawal told The Hindu that he disagreed with the underlying assumptions of the latest study. The timing of a hypothetical fourth wave, he said, could not be predicted because it was heavily dependent on the nature of a future variant. “There is absolutely no way to predict the timing. If at all we see one, it will be very short and would have to be caused by a highly infectious variant because you have to account for the fact that nearly 90% of India has been exposed to the virus,” he said. The SUTRA model does not yet see a fourth wave, he added. Gautam Menon, of the Ashoka University and who has been closely involved with efforts to mathematically model the pandemic argued in an explanatory Twitter thread that the forecast of a fourth wave “shouldn’t be taken seriously” because epidemiology wasn’t an exact science like physics or chemistry. The pandemic waves were being driven by variants, none of which could be predicted in advance, and modelling could at best be useful for “broad policy rather than a highly specific prediction of numbers.” Zimbabwe’s median age was 19 as opposed to India’s 30 and had a vaccination coverage of 40% of the population to India’s 75%. These meant different degrees of “hybrid immunity” (that is protection from future infections due to a combination of vaccines and previous exposure) and the current study did not account for this rendering their predictions unusable, he opined. “Should one trust this model at all? The answer, simply, is no.”",Jacob Koshy,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/experts-denounce-study-that-forecasts-fourth-covid-wave-in-june/article65184027.ece
801,"March 02, 2022",17:51 IST,sci-tech,science,Science newsletter Feb 23," Forgotten for centuries, Balkanatolia is a speculative, ‘third’ Eurasian continent, wedged between Europe, Africa and Asia. The continent likely came into existence 50 million years ago and lost its independent identity, because of a major glaciation event 34 million years ago, that led to the formation of the Antarctic ice sheet and lowering sea levels, connecting Balkanatolia to Western Europe. Why such a continent ought to have existed results from palaeontological evidence from centuries that posed a puzzle. During the Eocene Epoch (55 to 34 million years ago), Western Europe and Eastern Asia formed two distinct land masses with very different mammalian faunas: European forests were home to endemic fauna such as Palaeotheres (an extinct group distantly related to present-day horses, but more like today’s tapirs), whereas Asia had a more diverse fauna including the mammal families found today on both continents. Western Europe was known to be colonised by Asian species around 34 million years ago, leading to a major renewal of vertebrate fauna and the extinction of its endemic mammals, a sudden event called the ‘Grande Coupure’. Surprisingly, fossils found in the Balkans point to the presence of Asian mammals in southern Europe long before the Grande Coupure. This was best explained by the existence of a landmass, prior to the Eocene, that was disconnected and a continent of its own.

802,"March 02, 2022",10:30 IST,sci-tech,science,The largest and deepest probe into the human family tree," Andrew Wilder Wohns et al, “A unified genealogy of modern and ancient genomes”, Science, Vol. 375, 2022. DOI: 10.1126/science.abi8264 Building family trees is very popular with many people. But such an attempt is likely to take the process back to just a few generations at the most. In some cases, families have been traced back to hundreds of years. Now, we are to see that science has enabled us to take this process back thousands of years, and we can have a family tree of the entire human race, according to a study published in the Science journal. These family trees are constructed not by identifying individuals that one has descended from, but by taking from the human genomic databases, details of each chromosome (autosome) and constructing a “tree” that relates it to the parent from whom that particular chromosome was inherited. New work by researchers from the University of Oxford’s Big Data Institute builds up the family tree of the entire human race using this new methodology. This is the largest family tree ever, built with about 27 million ancestral haplotype fragments (ancestral DNA). The research has been published in the February 25 issue of Science, this year (“A unified genealogy of modern and ancient genomes”, Andrew Wilder Wohns et al, Science, Vol. 375, 2022). Among existing methods to build up a genealogy of humans, or any other organism whose genome data exists for that matter, the one involving “trees” appears to be more accurate. We already have such trees that have combined thousands of genomes and traced out demographic data. According to this study, ancient genomes can be integrated into these trees to give data from which one can infer historical details of demography. The present study, the latest in this line, takes into account more than 3,500 high-quality and ancient genomes from more than 215 different human populations. In addition, the researchers used, more than 3,000 ancient genomes to improve inferences from the trees. A “Perspective” article in the same issue of Science (written by Jasmin Rees and Aida Andres) gives an easy-to-read gist of the paper. Combining datasets that have been built up independently poses a huge challenge. The authors refer to discrepancies between cohorts due to errors, differing sequencing techniques, and the processing of variants, which can lead to a lot of “noise” that can drown out the “signal.” However, they do a smart building up of this tree, the largest one built up so far, and reproduce several well-known demographic results that have been given by previous methods such as using mitochondrial DNA and Y chromosome analyses. They reiterate the out-of-Africa emergence result, for one thing. The paper proposes a new method to determine the ancient geographical location of evolutionary events. They take the mid-points of the geographical locations of individuals featured in the tree and postulate that the location of the parents is at the mid-point of these. Thereafter, by repeating this procedure, they arrive at the location of the theoretical earliest common ancestor. Wohns et al write that despite the fact that the geographical centre of the sampled individuals is in Central Asia, when you go back 72,000 years into the past, this geographical centre shifts to Northeast Africa “and remains there until the oldest common ancestors are reached.” They further state, “the geographic centre of the 100 oldest ancestral haplotypes (which have an average age of approximately 2 million years) is located in Sudan.” While these results are supported by the oldest fossil findings, the authors caution that if the data had consisted of a grid sampling of genomes from Africa, for instance, the centre of gravity, which is now Sudan, could shift. The “Perspective” article also outlines some of the limitations of the tree method, namely, that there is an uncertainty in evolutionary parameters and errors in reading ancient genomes, but also point out that with more and better-quality data coming in, the tree method is likely to provide good answers; as larger and more data from under-represented populations becomes available, the answers would become more accurate. While this particular study has focussed on human genealogy, the authors point out that this can be used to trace out the ancestry of any species for which genomic data exists. It is important to appreciate that such an analysis would not have been possible in the twentieth century, when the human genome had not been sequenced, cutting edge techniques for isolating, identifying and sequencing genomes of archaic sources had not been developed, sophisticated computer simulation methods were not available and such perspectives had not been established. So truly, the building of this huge genealogy is a feat of twenty-first century science, and it brings together evolutionary biologists, repositories of information, simulation experts and high-power computing and data science to yield hitherto unimagined results.",Shubashree Desikan,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/building-the-most-exhaustive-family-tree/article65143893.ece
803,"February 28, 2022",15:47 IST,sci-tech,science,Smooth-coated otters come visiting after a long break," A search for a migratory stork in the Upper Anaicut near Mukkombu (on the road leading to the Butterfly Park) turned up another surprise visitor instead for the city’s nature lovers recently — the smooth-coated otter, a freshwater fish-loving animal that hasn’t been seen along the Cauvery river stretch for many years.  “We thought they were crows at first, but when we looked more closely, we realised it was a group of eight smooth-coated otters rolling around on the sandbank,” said A. Relton, associate professor and head, Department of Social Work, Bishop Heber College, who was part of the team led by the institution’s Nature Club on Sunday.  When spotted, the otters were rubbing themselves with ‘spraint’ or their own faeces, which is a peculiar part of the animals’ grooming behaviour and a means of olfactory communication, Mr. Relton told The Hindu. Listed as ‘Vulnerable’ on the IUCN Red List, the animals commonly occur in shallow and placid waters such as wetlands and seasonal swamps, rivers, lakes, and rice paddies. They are active during night and day, and are strong swimmers. Known as neer naai (aquatic dogs) in Tamil, the animal plays an important role in controlling the population of fish in rivers, said Mr. Relton. “Even though humans are fishing commercially, otters do this naturally. In fact the human impact of overfishing and depletion of water resources has caused the disappearance of smooth-coated otters from the freshwater bodies in the country,” he said. The animals are also illegally hunted for their pelt.  In the Cauvery delta, the drying out of riverbeds in recent years has driven away these animals. Significantly, the countrywide population of the otters remains undocumented.  Video clips shared by the Nature Club showed the otters swimming in the river in V-formation, led by a dominant male. “We identified four young and three females in the group. The swimming method is meant to narrow down the fishing area and prevent fish from escaping,” he said.  Besides the smooth-coated otter ( Lutra perspicillata), India is home to two more of the 13 species found worldwide. These are Eurasian Otter (L utra lutra) and Small-clawed otter (A onyx cinereus).  Mr. Relton said that Nature Club would soon be setting out for another expedition to look out for smooth-coated otters. “More people should be made aware of this animal in our ecosystem,” he said.",Nahla Nainar,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/smooth-coated-otters-seen-near-mukkombu-after-a-long-break/article65092310.ece

Created by Indic Inspirations for the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), the tee -shirt is a part of its Vyom collection. Most of the products, which include jigsaw puzzles based on Mangalyaan, rocket collectible matchboxes, mySpace PSLV notebooks and fridge magnets, come with a storyline.  “This collection is about ISRO’s achievements in space science and technology. We had to create a line that would interest a child and adults alike,” says Yogesh Dandekar, architect and chief product designer of Indic Inspirations. “India is doing a lot of work in space technology and people should know about this.” He adds that minute details on the models build up curiosity. When Indic Inspirations approached ISRO with a pitch to tell its story in a fresh style, ISRO reverted with a voluminous 10 GB of data. This included a catalogue filled with drawings of ISRO rockets, pictures taken by Cartosat, IRS satellites, by Mangalayaan and Chandrayaan, as well as videos of their launches. A line of 50 products was created from this.   A third generation artisanal engineering company from Moradabad, known for die casting, was roped in to manufacture medallions; Channapatna artisans, in house designers and a “passionate IIT Chennai engineer” worked to create the rocket shaped pencil box-to denote the PSLVs four stages- boosters, payload fairing and the satellite. “Channapatna uses lacquerware techniques with natural colours and dyes,” explains social entrepreneur and founder of Indic Inspirations, Sunil Jalihal. Since 2014, Indic Inspirations has been working with artisans and craftspeople for the Heart For Art Charitable Project that was set up to help India’s artisans connect with consumers. In 2019, it introduced a contemporary language to narrate stories of India using utilitarian products and souvenirs by introducing technology at every level of product design and engineering. In addition to e-commerce they opened a physical store, Phygital, in Pune. “There are various ways of narrating stories,” says Sunil, adding, “We believe that objects remain on people’s shelves and desks to be touched and felt. Our focus has been on narrating India’s culture and achievements using 65 indigenous crafts and artisan clusters who work with wood, metal, grass, pottery, folk painting, masks and such. The brand began with finding ways to present mythology in a modern context, says Sunil giving an example of using the mythical demon king Ravana’s ten heads as a dart board. “He was a master of the Vedas but his ten heads represent the vices. We shifted the bull’s eye a bit in the dart board we created.” Medallions, coasters, clocks were created in the product line that told the story of Zero or Shunya. Subsequently the company crafted products around the Indian Preamble, Flag and Constitution. “Our Constitution, besides being a legal document, is also a work of art. It was calligraphed by Prem Behari Narain Raizada, and illustrated by Nandalal Bose and his team. So, we have used original “constitution paper” that was used to frame the original constitution document, to frame the Preamble and such,” says Sunil.  Indic Inspirations also worked with artisans of Pattamadai in Tamil Nadu to revive the dying craft of weaving mats using darbha grass to create chic yoga mats. It helped revive a dying and ancient pottery craft in Kutch and recreated a Bidri work betel-leaf box that is at the Sotheby’s Museum in London.  Harking back to the space collection, Sunil is pleased that they are first registered merchandisers of ISRO and operate with them against a nominal license fee and a set of rules. He says the products have connected well with students, space watchers, astronomers and lay consumers, adding that a board game based on the Mars Mission is soon to be launched.",Priyadershini S.,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/isro-channapatna-rocket-engineers-artisans-collaborate/article65070355.ece
805,"February 26, 2022",18:00 IST,sci-tech,science,Trees on forest edges may grow faster than those inside," Is a tree in a forest the same as one outside it? The belief that it is, allays the conscience of government-backed afforestation programmes where dense forests are often razed for mines, and multiple saplings are commissioned in alternate locations that are usually outside forest boundaries. Conservationists have on the other hand pointed out that this isn’t the same because a loss of a section of forest means destroying an ecosystem that can’t be easily substituted for. To account for these losses more minutely, Lucy Hutyra, a bio-geochemist and ecologist at the Boston University, Massachusetts, U.S., has been analysing the terrestrial carbon sink. This is made up of the billions of square kilometres of forest in the world that are major storehouses of carbon. In net, forests store more carbon dioxide than they release and an estimated 30% of carbon emissions from emitting fossil fuels are absorbed by the forest, making them a terrestrial carbon sink. Trees absorb carbon dioxide (CO 2), release oxygen by way of photosynthesis, and store carbon in their trunks. When they shed, soil microbes work to decompose the leaves and other organic matter that releases the trapped carbon dioxide. A major prong of countries’ climate change strategy, including India’s, is to increase the terrestrial sink area. Hutyra, who has been researching the consequences of forest loss, examined if the same species of tree had different patterns of carbon dioxide storage when located at a forest edge or further away. The textbook assumption was that trees at forest edges release and store carbon at similar rates as forest interiors, but Hutyra and her colleagues report this isn’t true. In two papers published in the peer-reviewed Global Change Biology, and Nature Communications, Hutyra's team found edge trees grew faster than their country cousins deep in the forest, and that soil in urban areas can hoard more carbon dioxide than previously thought. Using data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Inventory and Analysis program – which monitors tree size, growth, and land use across the country – Hutyra's team looked at more than 48,000 forest plots in the Northeast United States. They found trees on the edges grow nearly twice as fast as interior trees – those roughly 100 feet away from the edge. ""This is likely because the trees on the edge don't have competition with interior forest, so they get more light,"" says Luca Morreale, a PhD candidate in Hutyra's lab, in a press statement. In another related study, Hutyra found differences even in the way soil in forests and outside released carbon dioxide. Warmer temperatures at the edge of the forest caused leaves and organic matter to decompose faster, as it forced soil microorganisms to work harder and release more carbon dioxide than their cooler, more shaded peers in the forest interior. But, in urban forests, where the ground was significantly hotter and drier, those soils stopped releasing as much carbon, they note in a press statement from Boston University. Though these studies were specific to Massachusetts, there are implications for India too. Conservationists have noted that plantations outside forests don't capture carbon efficiently and don't make up for biodiversity losses. The India State of Forest Report (2021) released in January found that nearly 28% of the forest cover is outside the recorded forest area. About 12% of the forests classified as ‘very dense’ is also outside the recorded areas. Following a trend and noted in previous editions of the forest surveys, the increase in forest cover between 2019 and 2021 was led by growth outside the recorded area and the sharpest increase was in so called ‘open forest’ where any patch over a hectare and having a canopy density more than 10% counts as ‘forest.’ This brings in man-made plantations of cash crops such as tea and coffee plantations and mango orchards and even tree-lined avenues in densely built-up cities were being classified as ‘forest’.  Ecologists M. Madhusudan and T.R. Shankar Raman note: “In one stroke, just between the 1999 and the 2001, this redefinition helped raise India’s forest cover by over 38,000 sq.km.” They highlight research in the Western Ghats that finds plantations deplete groundwater, have higher surface water runoff, poorer soil infiltration, compared to trees in natural forests. They also report that carbon stocks in plantations such as teak and eucalyptus were 30% to 50% lower than in natural evergreen forests and were generally less stable and resilient. The biggest loss, however, was that species dependent on forests—from insects to primates—were ripped apart from their natural habitats and plantations, which were mostly monocultures, rarely had the capacity to support a rich, biodiverse system.",Jacob Koshy,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/trees-on-forest-edges-may-grow-faster-than-those-inside/article65086563.ece
806,"February 26, 2022",18:00 IST,sci-tech,science,"Staying Healthy, Eating Less"," For modern humans, three meals a day may seem to be the ideal formula for being healthy and wise. Yet, evolutionarily speaking, our bodies are adapted to occasional periods of fasting, as a constant supply of food was not always guaranteed. Fasting is certainly a part of our heritage, being prevalent in a range of cultures – from Ekadashi to Karwa Chauth among Hindus; the Yom Kippur for Jews, Paryushana among Jains, Ramzan among Muslims, the Christian period of Lent, and so on. One wonders if widespread prevalence points to health benefits in addition to the discipline of the mind. In 2016, a study of data from 186 countries in the journal The Lancet revealed that obese people now outnumber underweight individuals. Our lifespans, too, are much longer than they were two generations ago. Together, these trends have added greatly to the disease burden of society, and other than exercise, only fasting and caloric restriction (CR) have consistently been shown to extend a healthy lifespan. Fasting and CR are not synonymous. CR results from reducing caloric intake by 15% to 40%, without leading to malnutrition. There are several strategies for fasting. In intermittent fasting (IF), you alternate a 24 hour period without any food (or with no more than 25% of your dietary norm) with 24 hours of normal eating. In periodic fasting you fast for one or two days followed by five days of normal diet. In time-restricted feeding (TRF), all daily intake is done within a 4–12 hour window. In an example of a fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) you reduce intake to 30% of your energy requirements for five consecutive days, once every month. In addition, the ratio of fats, proteins and carbohydrates may be altered during reduced intake to favour more fat. The island of Okinawa in Japan has an exceptional number of healthy centenarians because adults practice Hara Hachi Bu – stopping eating when they are 80% full (CR). Buddhist monks of certain sects eat their last meal at noon (TRF).  These strategies have been examined in a large number of studies on rodents and on humans – we humans often have difficulty in sticking to restricted diets! When properly adhered to, these practices have been shown to prevent obesity, to protect against oxidative stress and hypertension. They also mitigate and postpone the onset of several age-related diseases. Careful monitoring and expert advice is essential for choosing suitable strategies based on individual circumstances such as age. We store glucose in the form of glycogen in the liver, and the energy demands of the body are met from this reservoir. One day of fasting leads to a 20% decrease in blood sugar levels and depleted glycogen reserves. The body switches to a metabolic mode where energy is obtained from fat-derived ketone bodies and from glucose outside the liver. Insulin levels are lowered and lipolysis burns away lipid triglycerides in adipocytes. The metabolic syndrome is a group of risk factors that are predictors of heart disease and diabetes. The work of Satchidanand Panda at the Salk institute has highlighted the benefits of a 10-hour TRF on sufferers, and noted improvements in blood pressure, heart-rate variability and physical endurance (Longo and Panda, Cell Metabolism, 23, 1048–1059 (2016)). IF has also been shown to cause a remodelling of the gut microbiome. Bacterial diversity goes up, and there is a rise in bacterial species that produce short-chain fatty acids, which are known to thwart inflammation-mediated conditions such as ulcerative colitis. In the fruit fly, prolonged overnight fasting promotes a recycling process inside cells called autophagy (Latin for self-devouring). This results in a 15%-20% extension in lifespan (Ulgherait, M. et al, Nature, 598, 353–358 (2021)). Autophagy mostly occurs at night and is modulated by the body's circadian clock. Autophagy is essential for the fitness and survival of neurons; errors in this process lead to Parkinson's disease.  A plentiful supply of nutrients represses autophagy and activates pathways that promote the biosynthesis of proteins and thus of rejuvenation (Jouandin et al., Science 375, eabc4203 (2022)). This dynamic control of degradation and rejuvenation suggests that IF, TRF, FMD and periodic fasting may be better for the body than chronic caloric restriction., A few small organic molecules – rapamycin, metformin and resveratrol – appear to affect our metabolic pathways in ways that mimic the effects of fasting. Could it turn out that some day we could be able to imbibe carefully tailored pills and eat our cake, but not put on weight ?

807,"February 26, 2022",18:00 IST,sci-tech,science,"Having enemies makes you stronger, finds a study of flies co-evolved with bacterial pathogen"," The natural world is rife with pairs of antagonists. Plants and viruses, insects and pathogens, bacteria and their phages, and so on. In these systems, it is an interesting question to study how the resistance to a pathogen, in the case of the host, and virulence towards the host, in the case of a pathogen, evolve. Towards understanding this better, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Mohali researchers have taken up the system of the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) and a bacterial pathogen that affects the fruit fly, sometimes even causing death – Pseudomonas entomophilia – have been co-evolved to study the pathway of evolution taken by the system of antagonists. In this case, they find that being surrounded by enemies actually makes the organism stronger, or fitter, to combat the enemy.  How does one set up a co-evolving system experimentally? A population of flies are infected by the pathogen and the infection is allowed to take its course. Among the infected flies, only those that survive the infection, namely the ones that have the best immune systems to combat the pathogen, are taken to breed the next generation. Similarly, bacteria are collected from the flies that die due to the infection. These are the bacteria that have the virulence sufficiently strong to cause death in the present population. These bacteria are taken to breed and also infect the flies in the next generation. Thus, both the host (fruit fly) and the pathogen (bacteria) are ‘selected’ for having the maximum fitness.  The methodology of the experiment is like this: Four types of populations were bred in the lab. One in which, as described above, the host and pathogen both co-evolved. The second was a population in which only the host was selected from the flies that did not die due to the infection. Every generation, infection was done from a stock of ancestral bacteria which was not evolving. The third and fourth were two types of control populations.  This methodology allowed the researchers to compare the evolution process in hosts that were co-evolved against their pathogen and the hosts that were adapted against a static, non-evolving pathogen. They found that the former category evolved higher survivorship against the co-evolved pathogen than the hosts that was adapted against a non-evolving, static pathogen. Further they also found that the co-evolved hosts showed higher survivorship with respect to ancestral, unevolved pathogens than their counterparts who have been pitted against static pathogens.  From the point of view of the pathogens also a similar improvement in fitness was seen – the co-evolved pathogens develop greater virulence and capacity to cause death than the ancestral, unevolved pathogens. “This evolved virulence of co-evolving pathogens was higher towards both their local hosts (against which they coevolved each generation) and nonlocal hosts,” says Dr. Neetika Ahlawat, from the Department of Biological Sciences at IISER Mohali, who led the research. The work has been published in the journal E cology and Evolution. The evolution pathways described above then lead to the conclusion that having enemies makes the organism stronger. Just as the host evolves a stronger, more resistant immune system when pitted against a co-evolving pathogen, the pathogen also becomes more virulent when allowed to evolve against a co-evolving host.  The experiment is the first to study co-evolving insect–pathogen pair, that is, Drosophila melanogaster and Pseudomonas entomophilia. Earlier studies have either studied insects evolving against static pathogens or have studied bacteria and virus pairs that are co-evolving. “This is also the first study to compare insect–host evolution to a co-evolving pathogen versus host evolution towards a non-evolving or static pathogen,” says Prof. N.G. Prasad, senior author in the study.  The interactions being very complex, it was hard to predict the outcomes, and there were surprises: The researchers expected the co-evolving pathogens to show specificity towards their local co-evolving hosts as these two antagonists were allowed to co-evolve for several generations in closed association. “However, contrary to our expectations, we observed a rather more general effect of evolved virulence of the co-evolving pathogens,” he clarifies.  When the researchers started, they anticipated major challenges in conducting the study. There were four selection regimes (host–pathogen co-evolution, one-sided host evolution to a static pathogen and two controls) each with four population sets to evolve. “In view of the fly mortality caused due to pathogenic infection, we had to pick a relatively larger fly population size in both the selected populations,” says Dr. Ahlawat.  “In our lab, we manually infect each individual fly using a sterile needle dipped in bacterial solution every single time,” she says. Infecting about 1,000 flies individually for each group in one single day was a major challenge. Each replicate (group) containing four populations (two selected and two control) were handled on different days. “This means 1,000 fly infections daily for four days. Therefore, we had to infect 4,000 flies each generation, over 20 generations,” says Dr. Ahlawat.

808,"February 25, 2022",14:07 IST,sci-tech,science,Tipping point," To say Kangra is enchanting would be trite. The sunlit valley stretches beyond cumulus clouds, flanked by the jagged Dhauladhar range on one side and rolling green hills on the other. Birches, chir pines and deodars sway in the wind. As our small aircraft starts its descent, we get a glimpse of River Beas flowing below and the expansive Pong dam’s reservoir. But all this beauty is deceptive — the Indian Himalayan Region is facing an as yet unrecognised existential crisis: mountains of solid waste. Tourism in this region generates some eight million tonnes of waste every year. Added to this is the one million tonnes of annual waste generated by the urban population. By 2025, it is projected that 240 million tourists will visit the hill States every year: it was 100 million in 2018. If the problem of solid waste disposal is not addressed scientifically, the fragile ecosystem of the Himalayas will pay a price the country can ill-afford. Given that all our major glacial rivers originate in these mountains, it’s not difficult to envisage the catastrophic implications.  The Himalayan region comprises 10 States, of which Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh bear the biggest brunt. Although the local population density is not very high, these States attract vast numbers of tourists — campers, trekkers, mountaineers, backpackers and pilgrims. And the waste they generate now impacts the ecology crucially.  Unlike the plains, usable land is scarce in the Himalayan region, with habitations either on the ridges of mountains or in valleys such as Kangra and Kullu. While hillocks of garbage can rise in the peripheries of cities on the plains, hill towns have no such space. What is mindlessly thrown out remains on the slopes forever, turning into major polluters of land, water and air. From Kangra airport, I drive up to the office of Waste Warriors, an NGO based in Dharamshala, which works in Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh to educate and train people in solid waste management. Etoshi Chattejee, 33, heads the team. She was a software professional before joining the NGO. Shashank Prabhu, 24, is an electrical engineer from Karnataka and Nidhi Sharma, 29, from Shimla, has a degree in social work. Together, they work with the municipal corporation, district authorities, colleges, schools and households. This committed team organises workshops to train and create awareness, and works in two of the 17 wards in Dharamshala town. It also collects non-biodegradable waste for segregation, processing and recycling.  Documents they hand me have some astonishing information: cigarette butts take 12 years to decompose; plastic bottles 450 years; glass bottles thousands of years; cardboard two months; newspapers one month, juice cartons five years; cans 200-500 years; and polystyrene foam cups — never. My education begins. Later in the afternoon I head to Rakkar village on the outskirts of Dharamshala. Here, on leased land, is the NGO’s dry waste segregation centre, where some 200 kilos of dry waste is segregated every day. Much of the material is shredded or made into pellets before it’s taken for recycling elsewhere. I see paper, cardboard, cloth , glass, ceramic, metal and plastic. Together, they tell the story of modern living and patterns of consumption.  The municipality has recently allotted the NGO a new site, near a mountain stream, much nearer town, to set up a new material recovery facility for non-biodegradable and recyclable waste processing. Construction is on to set up a large galvanised iron shed. Dharamshala generates 25 tonnes of waste every month. The main waste, the biodegradable kind, is handled by the municipality. Composting, by various means, is the ideal means of disposal. Once done, bio-degradable waste can be used as manure to fertilize the soil. But compost pits need land, and the magnitude of the problem dwarfs the efforts. So the bio-degradable waste is transported to a dumping ground in Sudher village.  This has, in turn, led to protests by Sudher villagers, who are facing the brunt of the pollution. Open dumping is unscientific, especially in the sub-zero Himalayan conditions. Cold prevents decomposition. Since such dumps are open to the elements, they could release harmful gases such as methane and carbon monoxide. When bio-degradable waste mixes with water, it forms leachate, a toxic liquid that permeates groundwater. Open waste also releases toxic chemicals into the soil. Rainfall then carries the leachate to rivers and streams nearby. This is the primary reason of river pollution in the hills rather than industrial activity.  As for air pollution, open burning of waste is a major source besides particulate matter emissions. Pollutants such as dioxins, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, toluene and benzene are released into the atmosphere. Carbon and other light-absorbing impurities darken glacial snow and trigger melting. As for plastic, it needs segregation, processing and recycling, but in actual fact much of the plastic is burnt or dumped. Micro particles are carcinogenic and enter the food chain and cause enduring damage. Plastic also chokes rivulets and streams on the hill sides. The rivers of Himachal Pradesh — Ravi, Beas, Sutlej, Chenab, Yamuna, Ghaggar, Parvati, Devprayag, Baspa, Spiti and Tons — all copiously water the plains, but today, all of them are affected in various degrees.  Tourism has surely brought economic prosperity to the hills, accounting for as much of 7% of Himachal Pradesh’s GDP. This is a conservative estimate because there are many ancillary activities too. Besides, Dharamshala is now firmly on the cricket map of India. The new stadium is spectacular, with the Dhauladhar range as its backdrop and the cupolas of the pavilion silhouetted against its peaks. Some 25,000 spectators can be seated here, and people turn up from Delhi, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh for matches. Restaurants, hotels, resorts and homestays have come up.  But as the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) has pointed out, all this brings with it waste. A CSIR study finds that 55% of waste generated in the Himalayan region is biodegradable and comes largely from homes and eateries; 21% is inert such as construction material; 9% is paper; 8% is plastic; 4% is glass and ceramic and 3% metal.  In 2016, the Centre issued very progressive new rules for handling solid waste. Single-use plastic is now banned and the ‘polluters to pay’ principle has has the potential to deter polluters. But the key lies in enforcement. As biodegradable waste constitutes the largest chunk, its disposal has to be scientific rather than resorting to open dumping or burning. Himachal Pradesh, according to the CSIR study, has 54 dumpsites but no operational landfill. Scarce land in the hills makes it difficult to create landfills.  I leave Kangra on a day when rain is lashing and fresh snow has fallen on the Dhauladhar. As I wait for the flight to be called, it occurs to me that Dharamshala town, with a population of about 60,000 and legions of visitors, is a microcosm of the problem of waste management in the country. Urban India produces approximately 52 million tonnes of waste each year. It is estimated that by 2047 we will be generating 260 million tonnes annually, requiring 1,400 sq.km. of landfill area. Here, in the Himalayan region, at least there is the beginning of advocacy, awareness and action. But grave issues continue to loom in Kullu, Parvati, and Lahaul valleys, and in the Great Himalayan National Park, where tourist influx is very high. Even in the remote Kasol in Parvati valley, the ecosystem is under siege. Himachal Pradesh has the advantage of literacy. People are change-embracing. Government agencies are willing to work with NGOs and experts to tackle waste management issues. Yet, as Etoshi, with her experience on the ground, tells me, entrenched social attitudes to waste and waste removal need to change fast. It is too big a problem to be tackled by waste collectors and street sweepers alone.

810,"February 24, 2022",11:16 IST,sci-tech,science,Chandrayaan-2 detects solar proton events: ISRO," A Large Area Soft X-ray Spectrometer (CLASS), a payload on-board Chandrayaan-2 Orbiter, has detected solar proton events which significantly increase the radiation exposure to humans in space, the Indian Space Research Organisation has said. The instrument on January 18 also recorded coronal mass ejections (CMEs), a powerful stream of ionised material and magnetic fields, which reach the Earth a few days later, leading to geomagnetic storms and lighting up the polar sky with auroras, the ISRO said on Wednesday. ""Such multi-point observations help us understand the propagation and its impact on different planetary systems,"" it said. When the sun is active, spectacular eruptions called solar flares occur that sometimes also spew out energetic particles (called solar proton events or SPEs) into interplanetary space. Most of these are high energy protons that impact space systems and significantly increase radiation exposure to humans in space. They can cause ionisation on large scales in the earth's middle atmosphere, the space agency said. Many intense solar flares are accompanied by CMEs, a powerful stream of ionised material and magnetic fields, which reach the earth a few days later, leading to geomagnetic storms and lighting up the polar sky with auroras. Solar flares are classified according to their strength. The smallest ones are A-class, followed by B, C, M and X. Each letter represents a 10-fold increase in energy output. This means that an M class flare is 10 times more intense than C-class flare and 100 times intense than B-class flare, the ISRO said. Within each letter class there is a finer scale from 1 to 9 - a M2 flare is twice the strength of M1 flare. “Recently, there were two M-class solar flares. One flare (M5.5) spewed out energetic particles into interplanetary space and the other flare (M1.5) was accompanied by a CME,” the space agency said. The SPE event was seen by NASA's Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) orbiting around the Earth. However, the CME event was not detected by GOES. “Chandrayaan-2 Large Area Soft X-ray Spectrometer (CLASS) on-board Chandrayaan-2 Orbiter detected SPE due to an M5.5 class solar flare that occurred on January 20, 2022,” the ISRO said. “The CLASS instrument also detected a CME event as it passed through the moon due to an M1.5 class solar flare that occurred on January 18,” it added. The CME travels at a speed of about 1,000 km/s and it takes about two-three days to reach the Earth. “The signature of this event is missed by the GOES satellite, as the earth's magnetic field provides shielding from such events. However, the event was recorded by Chandrayaan-2,” the ISRO said. “The CLASS payload on Chandrayaan-2 saw both the SPE and CME events pass by from two intense flares on the Sun,” it added. Planned to land on the moon's south pole, Chandrayaan-2 was launched on July 22, 2019. However, the lander Vikram hard-landed on September 7, 2019, crashing India's dream to become the first nation to successfully land on the lunar surface in its maiden attempt. The ISRO had then said the mission achieved 98% success as the orbiter continues to share data with the ground station.

811,"February 24, 2022",10:30 IST,sci-tech,science,Explained | NASA’s plan to decommission the International Space Station," The story so far: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has announced plans to retire and decommission the International Space Station (ISS) by 2031. The U.S. space agency has detailed its goals for the next decade in the International Space Transition Report as it aims to hand over operations to commercial organisations. NASA has listed an elaborate outline of the plan to decommission the space station. Other international partners that operate the ISS are, however, yet to approve it.  The ISS was launched in 1998 as part of joint efforts by the U.S., Russia, Japan, Canada and Europe. The space station was assembled over many years, and it operates in low-earth orbit. Since its inception, the ISS has served as a laboratory suspended in space and has aided multiple scientific and technological developments.  The idea of a space station originated in the 1984 State of the Union address by former U.S. President Ronald Reagan. “A space station will permit quantum leaps in our research in science, communications, and in metals and lifesaving medicines which could be manufactured only in space. We want our friends to help us meet these challenges and share in their benefits. NASA will invite other countries to participate so we can strengthen peace, build prosperity, and expand freedom for all who share our goals,” he had said.  ISS has consistently maintained human presence for the past 21 years, providing astronauts with sophisticated technologies for scientific research.  The ISS was originally built to operate for 15 years. The space station has already surpassed that checkpoint by being active for 21 years, with plans to continue operations till 2030. However, the limitations on the life-cycle of the station are catching up. The ISS goes through 16 rotations of the earth per day, causing extreme temperature changes on the exterior. The side facing the sun can get heated up to 121°C while the temperature on the opposite, darker side can fall to –157°C, causing intense expansion and contraction of the building material. This orbital thermal cycling, coupled with dynamic loading, affects the longevity of the primary structure of the space station. The technical lifetime is also limited by parts like radiators, modules and truss structures that tend to degrade over time.  NASA is planning to transition operations in low-earth orbit to private players and focus energies on its missions to explore the moon and Mars.  NASA plans to remove the ISS from its orbit around the earth and eventually plunge it into the ocean at a point farthest from human civilisation. The space agency will use the dual method of natural orbit decay and a re-entry manoeuvre to bring an end to the ISS as we know it.  According to the plan, the earth’s natural atmospheric drag will be used in lowering the altitude of the ISS while setting up the de-orbit. The space station operators will then provide the final push to it to lower the structure to the maximum possible height and ensure safe re-entry into the earth’s atmosphere, leading it to Point Nemo over the South Pacific Oceanic Uninhabited Area (SPOUA). The exterior of the modules is expected to melt when the debris re-enters the earth’s atmosphere. The exposed internal hardware is also expected to burn or vaporise during the process. It is believed that denser components like the truss sections will survive the re-entry and fall into the SPOUA. Alternative options like disassembly and return to the earth, boost to a higher orbit, and random re-entry were also considered.  The ISS is a huge structure — almost the size of a football field — and it was not designed to be disassembled easily in space. This process would have posed huge logistical and financial challenges. ISS cannot be decommissioned by boosting to a higher orbit because of its large mass and low operational altitude. The station currently operates in low-earth orbit above 400 km in altitude, at a point where it still experiences atmospheric drag and requires re-boosts to continue in its orbit. The station also has a mass of over 4,30,000 kg. Existing propulsion systems do not have the capacity to raise the station’s altitude to a high target and escape low-earth orbit. The random re-entry method was discarded since it carries a huge risk for the human population on the ground.  NASA claims that the debris of the ISS that survives the re-entry will settle on the ocean floor and not cause any substantial long-term impact.  As the ISS plans to end operations in space, new players are already lining up to replace it. In January 2022, China announced that its space station will be ready for operations this year. Blue Origin, the aerospace company founded by Jeff Bezos, has also announced its plans to build Orbital Reef, a commercially developed, owned, and operated space station in low-earth orbit. Blue Origin is working alongside Sierra Space on the project.

813,"February 19, 2022",23:07 IST,sci-tech,science,New observations help explain the universe’s most energetic objects," Observations showing a roughly dough-nut-shaped cloud of cosmic dust and gas shrouding a huge black hole at the heart of a galaxy similar in size to our Milky Way are providing scientists with new clarity about the universe's most energetic objects. Scientists said on Wednesday that their observations involving the supermassive black hole at the centre of galaxy Messier 77 and its surrounding cloud lend support to predictions made three decades ago about what are called “active galactic nuclei.” These are places at the centres of many large galaxies that have tremendous luminosity – sometimes outshining all of a galaxy's billions of stars combined – and produce the universe's most energetic outbursts seen since the Big Bang event 13.8 billion years ago. The energy arises from gas violently falling into a supermassive black hole that is surrounded by a cloud of tiny particles of rock and soot along with mostly hydrogen gas. Black holes are extraordinarily dense objects possessing gravitational pulls so powerful even light cannot escape them. Supermassive black holes, which reside at the centre of many galaxies, including our own, are the largest of them. Messier 77, also called NGC 1068 or the Squid Galaxy, is located 47 million light years – the distance light travels in a year, 9.5 trillion km – from the Earth in the constellation Cetus. Its supermassive black hole has a mass roughly 10 million times greater than our sun. The observations, using the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope in Chile’s Atacama Desert, provided strong support for what is called the “unified model” of active galactic nuclei. This model holds that all active galactic nuclei are basically the same but that some appear from the vantage point of Earth to have different properties. Some look intensely bright because the position of their
ring-like cloud does not obscure the gas plummeting into the black hole from our viewing angle. Others look dark because the
cloud blocks our view of what is truly happening. Messier 77's active galactic nucleus is one of the dark ones, but the new observations indicate that it actually possesses the same qualities as the bright ones. ""The dust and gas in these clouds are probably blown out of the atmospheres of stars at a larger distance – hundreds of light years – from the black hole, and are falling in towards the centre under the influence of the black hole gravity,"" said Violeta Gamez Rosas, an astronomy doctoral student at Leiden University in the Netherlands and lead author of the research published in the journal Nature. ""Some clouds spiral in towards the black hole while others are pushed up into a 'fountain' that falls back onto the galaxy. Because of the dust, it is very difficult to see with telescopes what is going on in this region, but it is easier at infrared wavelengths than at normal visible wavelengths because the dust does not absorb infrared light as much,"" said study co-author Walter Jaffe, a Leiden University astronomy professor. The Milky Way's supermassive black hole, which has a mass 4 million times greater than the Sun, is currently ""fairly quiet,"" Gamez Rosas said, but previously may have been more active like Messier 77's. Gamez Rosas expressed satisfaction at studying active galactic nuclei. ""A lot of it is pure fascination with explosions on such gigantic scales, and the challenge of trying to explain them with what we think we know about physics,"" Gamez Rosas said. ""There is also the challenge of trying to build and operate telescopes to make these images of things so far away,"" Gamez Rosas added. ""And there is the peace of mind that results from the knowledge that there is a large, complex, varied universe that goes its own way whatever we do on Earth.""",Reuters,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/new-observations-help-explain-the-universes-most-energetic-objects/article65063709.ece
814,"February 19, 2022",18:27 IST,sci-tech,science,Moths vital to pollination in Himalayan ecosystem reveals study," Moths are vital to pollination in the Himalayan ecosystem of northeast India, reveals a recent study. The study establishes 91 species of moths as potential pollinators of 21 plant families in Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh in the northeastern Himalayas. The results assume significance as a majority of the pollination-related studies are based on diurnal pollinators (bees and butterflies) and the role of nocturnal pollinators have so far received less scientific attention. The details of the study were recently published in a paper titled “ Settling moths are the vital component of pollination in Himalayan ecosystem of North‑East India, pollen transfer network approach revealed” in Scientific Reports, a publication from the Nature group of journals. “In the present study about 65% moths (91 species) carried sufficient quantities of pollen grains to be considered as potential pollinators. Teliphasa sp. (Crambidae) and Cuculia sp. (Noctuidae) are found to carry the highest quantity of pollen,” the paper reads. Navneet Singh, lead author of the study, said that  Geometridae (geometer moths) and Erebidae (erebid moths, tiger moths, lichen moths, among others ) turned out to be the most important moth families for pollen transportation in the Himalayan region. “We also found frequent interaction of moths with Betulaceae, Fabaceae, Rosaceae and Ericaceae . Though the Betulaceae is predominantly a wind-pollinated plant family, some recent studies indicate that wind-pollinated plant families also benefit from enhanced dispersal by insects,” Dr. Singh, who is associated with the Zoological Survey of India (ZSI), added Another interesting outcome of the study is that the moth species  Achaea janata (a well-known pest of various economically important plants) was identified as a potential pollinator of three plant families, indicating that moths can provide net benefits as pollinators even when acting as larval herbivores of the same species. Scientists of the ZSI said that the study assumes significance as it revealed a high degree of selectivity in moths, which are generally considered generalists (that is, not very choosy about food plants), and season and altitude affect the role of moths as potential pollinators.  According to Dr. Singh and his fellow authors, the research, which is part of a project funded by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, was among very few large scale studies at a global level where the research team studied the effect of various seasons and different altitudes on the pollination ecology of moths. The research is based on the field work conducted in the Himalayan terrains, from the foot hills to elevations up to 3,000 m, and also based on the laboratory investigations of more than 1,800 moth proboscides (mouth parts of moths). Along with Navneet Singh, the other contributors to the publication are Rajesh Lenka, Pallab Chatterjee and Dipayan Mitra. Dhriti Banerjee, Director of ZSI, said that generally moths are considered mysterious denizens of nights, and for a long time they were better known as pest species. “This study revealed the importance of moths in nature. When we are sleeping in our bedrooms, they are tirelessly working for the ecosystems to work, on which our survival is invariably dependent, and are helping in a great way towards food security,” Dr. Banerjee said. Scientists behind the study emphasise that the interaction between moths and plants established through research points out that the species-interactions are much more complicated than they are actually considered. According to Dr. Singh, there are about 12,000 moth species in India and about 160,000 moth species in the world, and the study can go a long way in understanding the role of the nocturnal insect pollinators.",Shiv Sahay Singh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/moths-vital-to-pollination-in-the-himalayan-ecosystem-finds-study/article65065332.ece
815,"February 19, 2022",12:23 IST,sci-tech,science,"Can dark matter be composed, even partly, of black holes?"," Astronomical observations suggest that a significant part of the universe is made up of dark matter which interacts with the rest of the universe only through the gravitational pull. Many large lab experiments have tried to detect elementary particles that could be candidates for dark matter. However, such dark matter particles have not been detected until now. So, the question arises – could dark matter be composed, at least partly, of compact objects such as black holes? New research by an international team of scientists, presents a new way of addressing this question. The paper has been accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. Several astronomical observations suggest that all galaxies are embedded in a “halo” of dark matter. The “visible” galaxy is like a disc embedded in a dark matter halo that is much larger in size. “One hypothesis is that dark matter comprises a large number of compact objects such as primordial black holes,” says P. Ajith from International Centre for Theoretical Sciences, Bengaluru, in an email to The Hindu.  He is the senior author of the paper and an expert on gravitational waves.  When the universe was very young, hot and dense – soon after the Big Bang, it must have had quantum fluctuations of its density. This, in turn, would have caused some regions to become extremely dense, and therefore, to collapse under their own gravity to form the primordial black holes.  “While we have no conclusive evidence of spotting these objects, some of the binary black hole mergers detected by the LIGO gravitational wave detectors might be primordial black holes. The question is open,” says Prof. Ajith. From a theoretical standpoint, there is good reason to believe that primordial black holes did form in the young universe. The paper explores what happens when such objects get in the way of gravitational waves travelling towards the Earth from the distance. They invoke a phenomenon called gravitational lensing that is used regularly in astronomy. When light travels through space and passes near a massive or compact body – a star, a galaxy or a black hole, for example, the intense gravity of that body may attract the light towards it, bending it from its rectilinear (straight line) path.  This phenomenon is known as gravitational lensing and was first observed by Arthur Eddington in 1919. Massive objects like galaxies can bend light significantly, producing multiple images, this is called strong lensing. Lighter objects like stars or black holes bend light less, and this is called microlensing. A similar lensing can happen to gravitational waves travelling towards the Earth, and this would leave signatures in the detected gravitational waves. This can be used to detect the presence, or the existence, of primordial black holes. Until now, individual black holes have not marked out these signatures on gravitational waves detected by the LIGO-VIRGO detectors. However, if all of the dark matter is made of primordial black holes, they should have produced detectable signatures on the gravitational wave signals. The researchers use the non-observation of the lensing signatures to assess what fraction of the dark matter could be made of black holes. “This provides a new way of constraining the nature of dark matter,” says Prof Ajith. He adds, “Our study concludes that black holes in the mass range from a hundred to a million solar masses can contribute only up to 50-80% of the dark matter in the universe.” This is an upper limit and the actual fraction can be much smaller. “These upper limits will get better and better with more and more observations.” The work is significant in being the first to use this method, which presents a new avenue for probing dark matter.

816,"February 19, 2022",18:00 IST,sci-tech,science,Why Omicron sub-lineage BA.2 spreads faster than BA.1," After quickly spreading to many countries and becoming the dominant strain in circulation within a very short time after Omicron was designated as a variant of concern on November 26, 2021, the Omicron sub-lineage BA.2 is now following the in the footsteps of BA.1 in many countries, including Denmark, the Philippines and South Africa in the past few weeks. This suggests that the sub-lineage BA.2 has a “selective advantage” over the original Omicron variant — BA.1 sub-lineage. The BA.2 has a “cluster of sequences that share many of the same mutations as the ‘original’ Omicron (BA.1) but is missing some mutations and has some other new ones,” Dr Emma Hodcroft, co-developer of Next Strain tweeted.  A few studies are now discovering that BA.2 sub-lineage has even higher propensity to spread among people and has the ability to infect people who have been fully vaccinated and/or previously infected by escaping from neutralising antibodies induced by vaccination or infection.  A study was carried out in 24 individuals who were fully vaccinated and received a booster shot of the Pfizer vaccine and eight participants who were naturally infected with SARS-CoV-2. In people who have been fully vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine, compared with the Wuhan strain, there was a 23-fold and 27-fold reduction in median neutralising antibody titres to BA.1 and BA.2, respectively. The results were posted in a preprint server medRxiv on February 7. Preprints are yet to be peer-reviewed. Two weeks after a booster shot, the reduction in median neutralising antibody titres to BA.1 and BA.2 was only 6.1-fold and 8.4-fold, respectively, compared with the Wuhan strain. The neutralising antibody titres to BA.2 were about 1.4-fold lower than BA.1. From a public health perspective, the study found that when vaccinated individuals were infected with BA.1, they developed robust neutralising antibodies against BA.2. So BA.1 infection in vaccinated people offered good protection against BA.2.  The differences in protection to BA.1 and BA.2 in both fully vaccinated and those who received a booster shot were not sufficiently different to explain why BA.2 is spreading widely in many regions of the world.  Another study by a team led by Dr. Dan H. Barouch from the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research, Boston, Massachusetts, U.S. found that both BA.1 and BA.2 had comparable ability to escape neutralising antibodies in people who are either fully vaccinated or naturally infected. Using a panel of 19 neutralising monoclonal antibodies as probes, the researchers found that like BA.1, BA.2 also totally or severely resisted 17 of 19 monoclonal antibodies but with certain critical differences. BA.1 was more resistant to one class of antibodies than BA.2, while BA.2 was more resistant to another class of antibodies tested. The results were posted as a preprint in bioRxiv sever on February 9.  “These findings have important public health implications and suggest that the increasing BA.2 frequency in the context of the BA.1 surge is likely related to increased transmissibility rather than enhanced immunologic escape,” Dr. Dan H. Barouch and others write.  Another study carried out in over 8,500 Danish households that were infected with the Omicron variant by a team led by Frederik Plesner Lyngse from the Danish Ministry of Health, Copenhagen, Denmark, found that unvaccinated, fully vaccinated and those who have received a booster shot were more susceptible to infection by BA.2 than BA.1. In short, BA.2 was more infectious than BA.1.  Surprisingly, the “relative increase in susceptibility was significantly greater in vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals which points towards immune evasive properties of the BA.2 conferring an even greater advantage for BA.2 in a highly vaccinated population such as Denmark,” the researchers note.  Unvaccinated people infected with BA.2 had greater transmissibility than those who were infected by BA.1. But this difference between BA.1 and BA.2 was not seen in people who have been fully vaccinated or among those who have taken a booster shot. The results are posted on a preprint server medRxiv on January 30, this year.  “We conclude that Omicron BA.2 is inherently substantially more transmissible than BA.1, and that it also possesses immune-evasive properties that further reduce the protective effect of vaccination against infection, but do not increase its transmissibility from vaccinated individuals with breakthrough infections,” the Danish researchers write.  Another study posted as preprint in bioRxiv found that in cell culture, BA.2 had higher ability to replicate in human nasal epithelial cells and also the ability to fuse with cells was higher.  Importantly, infection experiments using hamsters showed that BA.2 is more pathogenic than BA.1, the authors write.  In January, another sub-lineage of Omicron — BA.3 — was detected. It has 33 mutations in the spike protein. But none of the mutations are novel. Of the 33 mutations, 31 are seen in BA.1 as well, and the remaining two are seen in BA.2.  Compared with BA.1 and BA.2, the BA.3 sub-lineage is marked by slow spread. One reason could be the absence of six mutations seen in BA.1, according to an article in the BMJ.",R.

819,"February 17, 2022",03:50 IST,sci-tech,science,"Despite solar push, India lack solar waste policy"," While India ramps up its solar power installation, it does not yet have a firm policy on managing waste that results from used solar panels or from the manufacturing process. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) last December estimated that the global photovoltaic waste will touch 78 million tonnes by 2050, with India expected to be one of the top five photovoltaic-waste creators. India currently considers solar waste a part of electronic waste and does not account for it separately, according to a response to a question in the Rajya Sabha. However, said Minister for New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) R.K. Singh, a committee had been constituted under the chairmanship of the Ministry’s Secretary to propose an action plan to evolve a “circular economy” in solar panel, through reuse/recycling of waste generated. There was no commercial raw material recovery facility for solar e-waste operational in India, but a pilot facility for solar panel recycling and material recovery had been set up by a private company in Gummidipoondi, Chennai, Tamil Nadu. India has set a target of producing 100 GW of solar energy by 2022. The cumulative capacity of grid-connected solar photovoltaic (PV) installations is around 40 GW and of the current capacity, about 35.6 GW, is generated from ground-mounted plants and 4.4 GW from rooftop solar. A gigawatt is a 1,000 megawatt. Solar panels have an estimated life of 25 years, and given that India’s solar manufacturing industry took off around 2010 most of the installed systems were new and early in their calendar life cycle and therefore unlikely to generate a large quantity of solar waste. That, however, is only partially accurate, according to the Council for Energy, Environment and Water, a Delhi based think-tank. End-of-life was only one of the possible waste streams for PV modules and there were several other stages where modules could get damaged and were discarded, especially during transportation and installation. Additionally, modules could develop defects during the plant operations and be discarded even before their scheduled life span. Despite its ambitious expansion plans, much of India’s solar PV manufacturing uses imported components with parts mostly sourced from China. India now has a manufacturing capacity of 3GW for solar cells and 15GW for modules and, in the Budget this month, had announced a basic customs duty of 40% on modules and 25% on solar cell imports from April 1. In the CEEW’s reckoning, PV modules had so far likely generated a cumulative waste of nearly 285,000 tonnes, as of FY21, from the early-life loss of the installed 40 GW grid-connected solar capacity. “Hence, it will be imprudent to ignore and delay the issue of PV waste management anymore,” say CEEW analysts Akanksha Tyagi and Neeraj Kuldeep, in a report.",Jacob Koshy,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/despite-solar-push-india-lacks-waste-management-policy/article65056085.ece
820,"February 16, 2022",17:04 IST,sci-tech,science,Science For All | What is the Blue Blob?," The Blue Blob is a cold patch located south of Iceland and Greenland and little is known about it. However,a recent study theorises that it may have helped temporarily stall the melting of Arctic sea ice. The cold patch was most prominent during the winter of 2014-2015 when the sea surface temperature was about 1.4 degrees Celsius colder than normal. The Arctic region is reportedly warming four times faster than the global average. Iceland’s glaciers steadily shrank from 1995 to 2010, losing an average of 11 billion tons of ice per year. Starting in 2011, however, the speed of Iceland’s melting slowed, resulting in about half as much ice loss, or about five billiontons annually. This trend was not seen in nearby, larger glaciers across Greenland and Svalbard. The researchers found that cooler waters near the Blue Blob were linked to observations of lower air temperatures over Iceland’s glaciers and coincided with a slowing of glacial melting since 2011. Other scientists have proposed that the Blue Blob is part of the normal sea surface temperature variability in the Arctic. Notably, especially cold winters in 2014 and 2015 led to record cooling, which caused upwelling of cold, deep water, even as ocean temperatures around the region warmed due to climate change. Before the Blue Blob, a long-term cooling trend in the same region, called the Atlantic Warming Hole, reduced sea surface temperatures by about 0.4 to 0.8 degrees Celsius during the last century and may continue to cool the region in the future. A possible explanation for the Warming Hole is that climate change has slowed the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, an ocean current that brings warm water up from the tropics to the Arctic, thus reducing the amount of heat delivered to the region.

said on Thursday it had removed a network of social media
accounts with ties to the Brazilian military that posed as fake
nonprofits to play down the dangers of deforestation. (Sign up to our Technology newsletter, Today’s Cache, for insights on emerging themes at the intersection of technology, business and policy. Click here to subscribe for free.) Although the individuals involved in the network were active
military personnel, Meta's investigation did not find enough
evidence to establish if they were following orders or acting
independently, said a person with knowledge of the matter. Meta's quarterly report could be damaging to Brazil's
President Jair Bolsonaro. The far-right former army captain, a
longtime skeptic of environmentalism, has deployed the armed
forces to the Amazon on unsuccessful missions to reduce
destruction of the world's largest rainforest. The takedown operation, Meta's first to hit a network
focused primarily on environmental issues, may also add fire to
Bolsonaro's attacks on large tech firms, which he accuses of
stifling conservative voices on their platforms. Critics say Bolsonaro and his supporters use the platforms
to spread dangerous disinformation undermining Brazil's
democratic institutions. In its report, Meta said the unidentified network, which was
limited in scale and authentic engagement, used fake accounts on
Facebook and Instagram to post initially about land reform and
the pandemic in 2020 before turning its focus to environmental
issues last year. ""In 2021, they created Pages that posed as fictitious NGOs
and activists focused on environmental issues in the Amazonas
region of Brazil. They posted about deforestation, including
arguing that not all of it is harmful, and criticizing
legitimate environmental NGOs who spoke out against
deforestation in the Amazon,"" Meta said in its report. ""Although the people behind (the network) attempted to
conceal their identities and coordination, our investigation
found links to individuals associated with the Brazilian
Military."" Meta declined to provide additional information about its
investigation. Brazil's army said in a statement it was aware of Meta's
allegations, and had reached out to the company for access to
the data underpinning its claims of military involvement. It said it required all of its members to practice ""truth,
probity and honesty."" Bolsonaro's office did not reply to a request for comment.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/facebook-takes-down-brazil-environmental-disinformation-network-with-ties-to-military/article65302061.ece

824,"April 07, 2022",22:23 IST,sci-tech,technology,Elon Musk's arrival stirs fears among some Twitter employees," News of Tesla Chief ExecutiveElon Musk taking a board seat at Twitter has some
Twitter employees panicking over the future of the social media
firm's ability to moderate content, company insiders told
Reuters. (Sign up to our Technology newsletter, Today’s Cache, for insights on emerging themes at the intersection of technology, business and policy. Click here to subscribe for free.) Within hours of the surprise disclosure this week that Musk,
a self-described ""free speech absolutist,"" acquired enough
shares to become the top Twitter shareholder, political
conservatives began flooding social media with calls for the
return of Donald Trump. The former U.S. president was banned
from Facebook and Twitter after the Jan 6. Capitol riot over
concerns around incitement of violence. ""Now that @ElonMusk is Twitter's largest shareholder, it's
time to lift the political censorship. Oh… and BRING BACK
TRUMP!,"" tweeted Republican Congresswoman Lauren Boebert on
Monday. Despite Twitter's reiteration this week that the board does
not make policy decisions, four Twitter employees who spoke with
Reuters said they were concerned about Musk's ability to
influence the company's policies on abusive users and harmful
content. With Musk on the board, the employees said his views on
moderation could weaken years-long efforts to make Twitter a
place of healthy discourse, and might allow trolling and mob
attacks to flourish. In the wake of Trump's ban from Facebook and Twitter, the
billionaire tweeted that many people would be unhappy with U.S.
tech companies acting ""as the de facto arbiter of free speech."" MUSK'S INTENTIONS Musk has not articulated what he wants to do as a new board
member but he has telegraphed his intentions with his Twitter
activity. A week before Musk disclosed a 9.1% stake in Twitter,
he polled his 80 million followers on whether the site adhered
to the principle of free speech, and the majority voted 'no.' The employees, who asked not to be named for fear of
retribution, point to Musk's history of using Twitter to attack
critics. In 2018, Musk came under fire for accusing a British
diver who had helped rescue children trapped in a cave in
Thailand of being a pedophile. Musk won a defamation case
brought by the diver in 2019. When asked for comment, a Twitter spokesperson repeated a
statement from Tuesday that the board ""plays an important
advisory and feedback role across the entirety of our service,""
but daily operations and decisions are made by Twitter's
management and employees. ""Twitter is committed to impartiality in the development and
enforcement of its policies and rules,"" the spokesperson said. Some employees that Reuters spoke to were not so sure about
the company's commitment to this. ""I find it hard to believe (the board) doesn't have
influence,"" said one employee. ""If that's the case, why would
Elon want a board seat?"" But other employees Reuters spoke to said that Musk's
involvement could help quicken the pace of new feature and
product launches, and provide a fresh perspective as an active
user of Twitter. Neither Tesla nor Musk responded to requests for comment. Twitter's board figures prominently in discussions within
Twitter, more so than at other tech companies, one employee
said. That is because unlike Meta Platforms Inc, where founder
and CEO Mark Zuckerberg controls the company through a dual
class share structure, Twitter only has a single class of
shares, making it more vulnerable to activists like Musk. Teams
within Twitter often consider how to communicate a strategy or
decision to the board, for instance, the employee said. TRUMP'S RETURN? One employee familiar with the company's operations said
there were no current plans to reinstate Trump. A Twitter
spokesperson said there were no plans to reverse any policy
decisions. But a veteran auto analyst who covers Musk's operating style
at Tesla said such a decision may only be a matter of time. ""If Donald Trump was actually rich, he would have liked to
have done the same thing but he couldn't afford it. So Elon is
doing what Trump would have liked to have done,"" said Guidehouse
Insights analyst Sam Abuelsamid. ""I wouldn't be surprised"" if Twitter restores Trump's
account now that Elon owns nearly 10% of the company,"" he said. Longer term, employees said Musk's involvement may change
Twitter's corporate culture, which they say currently values
inclusivity. Musk has faced widespread criticism for posting
memes that mocked transgender people and efforts to stem the
spread of COVID-19, and for comparing some world leaders to
Hitler. Several employees were alarmed by the warm welcome Musk
received from Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal and cofounder Jack
Dorsey, which prompted them to hit the job market this week. ""Some people are dusting off their resumes,"" one person
said. ""I don’t want to work for somebody (like Musk).""",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/elon-musks-arrival-stirs-fears-among-some-twitter-employees/article65300644.ece

reported on Thursday an estimated 50% jump in
quarterly operating earnings to post its highest first-quarter
profit since 2018, beating expectations as solid demand
underpinned prices for memory chips. (Sign up to our Technology newsletter, Today’s Cache, for insights on emerging themes at the intersection of technology, business and policy. Click here to subscribe for free.) Earnings at the world's largest memory chip and smartphone
maker were also supported by brisk smartphone sales in the
quarter, along with a disruption at a rival NAND Flash chip
plant, analysts said. Samsung put its first-quarter profit at 14.1 trillion won
($11.6 billion) in a preliminary earnings release, versus a
Refinitiv SmartEstimate of 13.3 trillion won. Revenue likely
rose 18% from the same period a year earlier to a record 77
trillion won, also above market expectations. ""The guidance beat market expectations, probably due to
memory chip shipments and prices being better than expected,""
said Park Sung-soon, analyst at Cape Investment & Securities. Although memory chip prices dipped in the first quarter,
analysts said solid demand from data centre clients as well as
cautious investment spending by chipmakers and limited capacity
expansion buoyed Samsung's chip earnings, which make up about
half of its total profits. The chipmaker also likely benefited from a disruption at a
rival NAND Flash chip plant owned by Japan's Kioxia and American
firm Western Digital due to contamination of raw
materials. ""After the contamination issue at Kioxia, I think there were
rush orders for NAND Flash chips made to Samsung for products
that were meant to be secured from Kioxia,"" Park said. The disruption at the Kioxia plant in early February is
expected to drive up NAND Flash prices by 5%-10%, offsetting the
effects of modestly high inventories maintained by buyers, data
provider TrendForce said. Samsung shipped an estimated 72 million smartphones in the
first quarter, Counterpoint Research said, down some 11% from a
year earlier, mostly due to a later than usual release of its
newest flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S22. The Galaxy S22 series globally sold some 50% more in the
first week after its late February launch than its previous
model S21, according to Sujeong Lim, an associate director at
Counterpoint. Samsung is estimated to have shipped slightly over 6 million
units of the S22 series by the end of March, Lim said, adding
that sales were in line with initial expectations. Samsung is due to release detailed earnings on April 28,
when investors will be interested to hear any comments on its
M&A plans, how it plans to operate its memory chip business to
boost profitability, and chip demand outlook. Samsung shares fell 0.2% in morning trade, versus a 0.9%

(Sign up to our Technology newsletter, Today’s Cache, for insights on emerging themes at the intersection of technology, business and policy. Click here to subscribe for free.) The tech giant has secured a total of up to 83 launches over a five-year period, which according to the company, is the largest commercial procurement of launch vehicles in history. The contracts include 18 launches with Arianespace’s Ariane 6 rockets, 12 launches using Jeff Bezos-owned Blue Origin’s New Glenn, with options for up to 15 additional launches, and 38 launches on Vulcan Centaur, ULA’s newest heavy-lift launch vehicle. “Securing launch capacity from multiple providers has been a key part of our strategy,” Rajeev Badyal, VP of Technology for Project Kuiper at Amazon, said in a statement. “This approach reduces risk associated with launch vehicle stand-downs and supports competitive long-term pricing for Amazon, producing cost savings that we can pass on to our customers. The announcement brings Amazon’s satellite internet constellation one step closer to reality, as its rival Elon Musk-owned SpaceX continues to launch more Starlink satellites, having launched about 2300 satellites already, and expanding Starlink’s presence with about 2.5 lakh subscribers globally.  Amazon’s present agreement with ULA is in addition to its existing deal to secure nine Atlas V vehicles from the space launch firm, announced in April last year. Besides, Project Kuiper plans to launch two prototype missions later this year on ABL Space Systems’ RS1 rocket.

The platform, which competes with Twitter, said the move empowers users to prove the authenticity of their accounts on the platform, hence lending credibility to the thoughts and opinions they share. “Voluntary self-verification promotes visibility of genuine voices. A visible marker in the form of a green tick will identify an account as being self-verified,” it added. The move comes amid ongoing debates over whether or not user verification should be done on social media platforms to curb their misuse, and to ensure accountability. The issue was also raised during the ongoing Budget session of Parliament as a means to prevent user harm and spread of fake news. During the session, Minister of State for Information Technology Rajeev Chandrashekar had said that thee government is interested in balancing issues of privacy as well as the interests of safety and trust, and “mandatory verification” of social media platforms falls at the intersection of the two. Currently, there is no law or rule that allows for mandatory verification of users who use the social media platforms. For voluntary verification, Koo said users need to enter their government ID number and an one time password (OTP). Upon successful authentication, they get self-verified with a green tick in their profile.  The platform stated: “The validation process is carried out by Government-authorised third-parties. Koo would not store any information during the process. In addition to empowering users on the platform, voluntary self verification — by promoting authenticity — will also hopefully result in curbing online misinformation, hate speech, abuse and bullying.” “We are very proud to be the first social media platform in the world to launch a voluntary self-verification system. Users can get self-verified in less than 30 seconds through our safe and secure verification process,” Aprameya Radhakrishna, co-founder and CEO of Koo, said.

(Sign up to our Technology newsletter, Today’s Cache, for insights on emerging themes at the intersection of technology, business and policy. Click here to subscribe for free.) The announcement expands on plans for GM to begin building
two electric SUVs for Honda starting in 2024 - the Honda
Prologue and an Acura model. The automakers said the new deal is for ""affordable"" EVs,
including compact crossover vehicles, built using GM's Ultium
battery technology. The compact crossover is the biggest selling
auto sector in the world with annual volumes of more than 13
million vehicles, the companies said. The companies declined to say how much they are investing as
part of the new collaboration. GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said Tuesday at an Axios event
the pricing will come in below the $30,000 price tag planned for
the electric Chevrolet Equinox SUV. She said the new
lower-priced vehicles would be ""attainable EVs."" She said the new vehicle is part of GM's plan to surpass
Tesla in EV sales. ""We have a very important goal... that by mid-decade, by
2025, we'll sell more EVs in the U.S. than anyone else and to do
that, you need to have a portfolio of vehicles,"" Barra said,
noting GM plans a wide range of small to large EVs. ""We
definitely can scale and can do it quickly."" The companies said they will also discuss future battery
technology collaboration for electric vehicles in a push to
drive down costs. The deal is part of GM's push to achieve carbon neutrality
in its global products and operations by 2040 and eliminate
tailpipe emissions from light-duty vehicles in the United States
by 2035. Honda has said it aims to reach carbon neutrality on a
global basis by 2050. The Japanese carmaker owns a stake in GM's Cruise
self-driving car subsidiary and the carmakers are co-developing
the Cruise Origin autonomous EV. The companies also have a joint
venture to develop and produce hydrogen fuel-cell systems at a
plant in Brownstown, Michigan. ""Honda and GM will build on our successful technology
collaboration to help achieve a dramatic expansion in the sales
of electric vehicles,"" Honda CEO Toshihiro Mibe said.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gm-and-honda-to-produce-attainable-evs-in-bid-to-surpass-tesla-sales/article65295451.ece
838,"April 06, 2022",11:03 IST,sci-tech,technology,Big online firms face 0.1% supervisory fee under new EU rules,"  Major online platforms face a
yearly fee up to 0.1% of annual net income to cover the costs of
monitoring compliance with new European Union rules requiring
them to do more to police their content, an EU document shows. (Sign up to our Technology newsletter, Today’s Cache, for insights on emerging themes at the intersection of technology, business and policy. Click here to subscribe for free.) The Digital Services Act (DSA) rules are likely to be agreed
between EU countries and lawmakers later this month. Levying
such a fee would be a first for the European Commission, which
is the bloc's executive body. The move comes as the Commission seeks new sources of
revenue to fire up the region's economic growth in the wake of
the pandemic and also foster a greener and more digital economy.
It would need scores of experts to enforce the new tech rules. ""The overall amount of the annual supervisory fees shall be
based on the estimated costs the Commission incurs in relation
to its supervisory tasks under this Regulation,"" said the
document, which was seen by Reuters. ""The fee shall not exceed 0.1% of the global annual net
income of the provider of very large online platforms (or very
large search engine) in the preceding financial year."" The fee should be proportionate to the size of the service
as reflected by the number of its recipients in the EU, it
added. The Commission defines very large online platforms
subject to the DSA as those with 45 million or more monthly
active users. EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager told lawmakers and
member states last month that the fee could raise between 20
million euros ($22 million) and 30 million euros annually, a
person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Not-for-profit providers of very large online platforms and
very large online search engines will be exempt from the fees,
the document said, a move that will benefit companies such as
Wikipedia and research bodies. Vestager's proposal is likely to get the nod from member
states and EU lawmakers, which are scheduled to meet on April 22
for the fourth round of negotiations and widely expected to
result in a deal. ""We believe it is possible, we see progress,"" EU lawmaker
Christel Schaldemose, who is steering the DSA in the European
Parliament, told Reuters. The Commission declined to comment on the negotiations. Commission sources said a comparison could be made with
national telecoms regulators and the European Securities and
Markets Authority which impose fees on entities under their
supervision. ""We want the implementation of the DSA to be a success, and
support supervisory fees that are proportionate, backed by a
detailed methodology, and commensurate with industry standards,""

842,"April 05, 2022",20:10 IST,sci-tech,technology,Tesla's Musk may add to SEC ire with late report about Twitter stake," Did Elon Musk
break securities laws again? (Sign up to our Technology newsletter, Today’s Cache, for insights on emerging themes at the intersection of technology, business and policy. Click here to subscribe for free.) Former securities officials and professors said Musk may
have missed a key disclosure deadline when he bought 9% of
Twitter. And Securities and Exchange Commission regulators could
use any shortfall to try to punish Musk more for other lapses,
some believe. Musk on Monday disclosed that he bought a 9.2% stake in
Twitter Inc, making him the micro-blogging site's
largest shareholder and triggering a rise of more than 27% in
the company's shares.
The filing said March 14, 2022 is the date of the event that
requires the statement. U.S. securities law requires disclosure within 10 days of
acquiring 5% of a company, which in Musk's case would be March
24. A late report could lead to per-violation civil penalty of
up to $207,183, when adjusted for inflation, according to Urska
Velikonja, a law professor at Georgetown University Law Center. That's a financial slap on the wrist for Musk, the world's
richest person with $302 billion net worth, according to Forbes,
but the regulator could look into market manipulation
allegations regarding the Twitter stock buy and seek harsher
sanctions in an ongoing investigation regarding his Tesla stock
sales, experts say. ""This is not really a gray area. He acquired it and didn't
file within 10 days. It's a violation. And so this is a slam
dunk case from the SEC perspective,"" Adam C. Pritchard, a law
professor at University of Michigan Law School, said. The SEC is also investigating Musk's Nov. 6, 2021, tweet
asking his followers whether he should sell 10% of his Tesla
stake. The regulator reached a 2018 deal for Musk to get
preapproval on some of his tweets, following a Musk tweet that
he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private. The SEC said
that defrauded investors. The SEC said last month it has told Musk’s and Tesla’s
counsel that staff are conducting an investigation relating to
potential federal securities law violations. Pritchard said the SEC could ""tell a court that he's a
recidivist violator of the securities laws and that he needs to
be dealt with harshly."" SEC and Tesla did not respond to Reuters' requests for
comments. Musk also made market-moving comments about Twitter, after
his purchase, without disclosing his stake. On March 25, Musk tweeted a poll: “Free speech is essential
to a functioning democracy. Do you believe Twitter rigorously
adheres to this principle?” A day later, Musk, a prolific user of Twitter himself, said
that he was giving ""serious thought"" to building a new social
media platform. ""Musk is taking real risks here,"" said Velikonja. Musk was
playing a game with the SEC officials, saying ""'Stop me if you
can, but you can't,"" she said, adding, ""I do suspect the SEC is
going to look long and hard into whether they can bring
manipulation charges, along with the failure to file."" Musk has been critical of the social media platform and its
policies of late, accusing the company of failing to adhere to
free speech principles. ""Arguably, his social media posts about potential
alternatives to Twitter can be seen, in light of his previously
undisclosed stake, as a form of market manipulation to affect
the share price, but proving that seems difficult,"" Howard
Fischer, a former SEC council and a partner at law firm Moses &
Singer, said. ""The fact that the revelation of his stake caused a price
rise that resulted in Musk's stake increasing in value is
something that the SEC might look into.” Twitter stocks have surged since mid-March when Musk
purchased his stake. Musk's stake, valued at around $2.4 billion
at the closing price of March 14, jumped to $3.7 billion as of
Monday's closing price. In addition, some well-timed trades in Twitter options days
before Musk revealed his purchase are raising eyebrows among
options analysts. ""The SEC certainly would look at if anyone who knew about
the acquisition of these shares trading in advance of the
filing. I really think that would be the focus rather than the
tardiness,"" Jacob Frenkel, a former SEC enforcement attorney and
government investigations and securities enforcement practice
chair for law firm Dickinson Wright.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/teslas-musk-may-add-to-sec-ire-with-late-report-about-twitter-stake/article65293666.ece

The blocked channels had a cumulative viewership of about 262 crore and were being used to spread fake news, and coordinated disinformation over social media on subjects sensitive from the perspective of national security, foreign relations and public order, I&B Minister Anurag Singh Thakur told reporters on Tuesday. Mr. Thakur said some of them were spreading misinformation on the Ukraine-Russia conflict, COVID–19 and other issues that were directly impacting India. While all the previously blocked 56 YouTube channels were from Pakistan, the latest list comprises 18 from India. This is the first time action has been taken against Indian YouTube–based news publishers since the notification of the IT Rules, 2021, in February last year. Whether such channels are operating from foreign soil or from India, we will take action...we won’t shy away from taking decisions in future as well in the interest of India,” he said. Three Twitter accounts of the blocked YouTube channels, a news website and its Facebook account being operated from Pakistan have also been blocked. According to the Ministry, multiple YouTube channels were being used to post fake news on subjects such as the armed forces and Jammu & Kashmir. “The content ordered to be blocked also included certain anti–India content posted from multiple social media accounts operated in a coordinated manner from Pakistan,” it said. It is alleged that a significant amount of false content was being published by the channels related to the situation in Ukraine. It was aimed at jeopardising foreign relations, said the Ministry. These channels were using templates and logos of certain TV news channels, including images of their news anchors to mislead the viewers into believing that the news was authentic. “False thumbnails were used; and the title and the thumbnail of the videos were frequently altered to increase the virality of content on social media. In certain cases, it was also observed that systematic anti–India fake news was originating from Pakistan,” it said in a statement. With this action, since December 2021, the Ministry has issued directions for blocking of 78 YouTube–based news channels and several other social media accounts on grounds related to national security, sovereignty and integrity of India and public order.",Devesh K.

847,"April 05, 2022",16:26 IST,sci-tech,technology,Today’s Cache | Apple finds a supporter in Roblox," Lawmakers in Europe and Asia have moved against Apple’s App Store dominance in the past few years. The marketplace’s monopolistic reach has been criticised in both the continents.  In Asia, South Korea’s competition regulator passed a legislation that makes Apple open its iPhone to another digital marketplace. The legislation curtails Apple and Google from forcing app developers to use their in-app payment system.   Europe is making changes to how tech giants run their businesses in the region. Last week, the European Commission unveiled a Digital Markets Act (DMA), intended to rein the power of Big Tech firms, including Apple. The act aims to curtail the power of “gatekeeper” corporations; Apple is one of them. Commenting on DMA in 2021, Apple’s head of engineering services Craig Federighi said the “European policymakers have often been ahead of the curve, but requiring sideloading on iPhone would be a step backward.”  While EU and Asia are tightening their grip over Big Tech, the U.S. has been moving at snail’s pace. And there hasn’t been any legislative changes to regulate Big Tech firms operating in the country. The case against Apple’s App Store in the U.S. has been running for two years now. Epic Games, which sued the iPhone maker, largely lost its case on whether Apple’s fees and payment rules for app makers were anti-competitive. And Apple’s App Store continues to have a regulation-free run in the country. The company says its policy against allowing “side-loading” apps provides users privacy and safety.  Another gaming company supports Apple. Roblox, an online gaming platform, noted that the Cupertino-based company’s marketplace offers privacy and safety to its users. “Apple’s process for review and approval of apps available on the App Store enhances safety and security, and provides those apps greater legitimacy in the eyes of users,” the gaming company said in a legal filing last week. But Roblox’s affirmation has to be taken with a pinch of salt. The company is fighting its own content moderation battle as sex games, known as “condos”, are scattered on its platform, which is accessed by children around the world.  The company acknowledged the problem, according to a report by BBC. “We know there is an extremely small subset of users who deliberately try to break the rules,” it told the news organisation.

their underlying blockchain technology to help consumers make
payments more efficiently. (Sign up to our Technology newsletter, Today’s Cache, for insights on emerging themes at the intersection of technology, business and policy. Click here to subscribe for free.) As part of creating a global cryptoasset hub, financial
services minister John Glen said Britain will legislate to bring
some stablecoins under the regulatory net. Later on this year Britain will consult on creating
regulations for a wider set of cryptoasset activities, he said. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable
value relative to traditional currencies, or to a commodity such
as gold, to avoid the volatility that makes bitcoin and other
digital tokens impractical for most commerce. ""If crypto technologies are going to be a big part of the
future, then we in the UK want to be in, and in on the ground
floor,"" Glen told UK Fintech Week. ""We see enormous potential in crypto and we want to give
ourselves every chance to take maximum advantage."" Britain's ""detailed plan"" will also develop the potential of
blockchain, including whether it can be used for issuing British
government bonds or gilts. ""I don't know the answer but let's find out,"" Glen said. UK finance minister Rishi Sunak has also asked the Royal
Mint to create a non-fungible token which is to be issued by the
summer. An NFT is a digital asset that exists on blockchain, a
record of transactions kept on networked computers. A regulatory 'sandbox' will be launched by the Bank of
England next year for testing the use of blockchain in market
infrastructure, Glen said. The legal status of decentralised autonomous organisations
which use blockchain will also be studied, along with the
implications of crypto on tax, Glen said. ""On balance, we don't think the tax code will need major
surgery to make it work more easily for crypto,"" Glen said,. The tax treatment of ""defi"" loans – where holders of
cryptoassets lend them out for a return - will be assessed. Britain will also look at removing disincentives for fund

850,"April 05, 2022",10:50 IST,sci-tech,technology,Two key tech execs quit Truth Social after troubled app launch," The two Southern tech entrepreneurs had
the two qualities that Donald Trump’s Truth Social startup
needed: tech-industry expertise and a politically conservative
worldview aligned with the former president, a rare combination
in the liberal-leaning industry centered in San Francisco. (Sign up to our Technology newsletter, Today’s Cache, for insights on emerging themes at the intersection of technology, business and policy. Click here to subscribe for free.) Josh Adams and Billy Boozer - the company’s chiefs of
technology and product development - joined the venture last
year and quickly became central players in its bid to build a
social-media empire, backed by Trump’s powerful brand, to
counter what many conservatives deride as “cancel culture”
censorship from the left. Less than a year later, both have resigned their senior
posts at a critical juncture for the company’s smartphone-app
release plans, according to two sources familiar with the
venture. The departures followed the troubled launch of the company’siPhone app on Feb. 20. Weeks later, many users remain on a
waiting list, unable to access the platform. Trump Media &
Technology Group (TMTG) Chief Executive Devin Nunes, a former
Republican congressman, said publicly that the company aimed to
make the app fully operational within the United States by the
end of March. The company has an app for iPhones but no app for Android
phones, which comprise more than 40% of the U.S. market, though
the company has advertised seeking an engineer to build one. Boozer declined to comment and Adams did not respond to a
request. Representatives for TMTG and Trump did not respond to
requests for comment. This account is based on Reuters interviews with eight
people with knowledge of Truth Social’s activities, all of whom
spoke on condition of anonymity. Truth Social is part of a growing sector of tech firms
catering to conservatives and marketing themselves as
free-speech champions. The platform promised to give Trump
unfettered communication with the American public more than a
year after he was kicked off Twitter, Facebook and YouTube for
allegedly inciting or glorifying violence during the Jan. 6,
2021, riots at the U.S. Capitol. The exit of two executives critical to the app-launch
efforts could imperil the company’s progress as it tries to
prove it can compete with mainstream platforms such as Twitter,
said two people familiar with the company. Like Twitter, Trump’s
platform offers users the chance to connect and share their
thoughts. “If Josh has left… all bets are off,” one of those sources
said of tech chief Adams, calling him the “brains” behind Truth
Social’s technology. Another source familiar with the venture said that Boozer
also had a major leadership role as product chief, running
management across technology infrastructure, design and
development teams. Reuters could not determine the specific circumstances
behind the executives’ resignations, or whether they have been
replaced or their duties reassigned. It also remains unclear
whether Adams and Boozer still work on the venture in a
different capacity after quitting their executive posts. Their resignations came before their key roles in the
closely watched company were even publicly known outside of
Truth Social’s secretive culture. Adams and Boozer worked at a level just below Wes Moss and
Andy Litinsky, both former castmates on “The Apprentice,”
Trump’s hit reality TV show, according to a source familiar with
the venture. Moss and Litinsky have been the “senior, day-to-day
leadership” running the company since it started last summer,
the source said. The two men had pitched Trump on the
social-media venture in January of 2021, according to a person
familiar with the company’s founding. Reuters could not determine the specific job titles or
responsibilities of Moss and Litinsky, neither of whom responded
to requests for comment. TMTG has released little information
about its executive leadership team outside of CEO Nunes, who
joined in December. Another open question is how TMTG is funding its current
growth. The company is planning to go public through a mergerwith blank-check firm Digital World Acquisition Corp (DWAC)
. The deal is under scrutiny by the Securities and
Exchange Commission and is likely months away from being
finalised. DWAC disclosed in a regulatory filing last December that the
SEC was probing the deal. The SEC has not addressed the nature
of the inquiry and did not respond to a request for comment on
Sunday. Investors have pledged $1 billion to TMTG but they won’t
hand over that money until the DWAC deal closes. DWAC shares fell 13% after market opening Monday on a day
when Twitter saw its shares surge 25% after aninvestment by Telsa Chief Executive Elon Musk. Trump’s level of involvement with his namesake company and
the Truth Social platform also remains unclear. The former
president so far has written only one post - or “truth” - on the
platform, writing on Feb. 14: “Get Ready! Your favourite
President will see you soon!” Downloads of the Truth Social app have declined
precipitously, from 866,000 installations the week of its launch
to 60,000 the week of March 14, according to estimates from data
analytics firm Sensor Tower. The firm estimates the Truth Social
app has been downloaded 1.2 million times in all, trailing far
behind rival conservative apps Parler and Gettr at 11.3 million
and 6.8 million installations, respectively. When they joined the company last year, Adams and Boozer
embraced the vision for a social-media company with an
“anti-cancel culture” mission, according to one of the sources
familiar with the venture. The executives believed deeply in
creating an “open platform, where as long as you don’t say
anything that is criminal,” the person said, “you can be
entitled to your own opinion.” Reuters could not determine the exact date the two
executives joined the firm, but they were working on the Truth
Social app by the fall, according to two sources familiar with
the venture. As the company sought engineers that had both the requisite
skills and compatible politics, Adams and Boozer fit the bill,
another person familiar with the company said. To gauge whether
potential recruits were a good fit, hiring managers explored
candidates’ political ideology, in at least one case by scanning
their social media profiles and listening to their appearances
on podcasts, that person said. The company’s political bent limited its hiring pool. At
least one candidate rebuffed a recruitment overture, saying he
couldn’t stomach working for Trump, the person familiar with the
company said. Others who rejected the company's outreach said
they were concerned about job security and feared the company
and its employees might be prime targets for hackers, according
to two people with knowledge of the firm's recruiting efforts. Adams joined Trump’s company after building a career as a
software developer from his native Alabama. He co-founded Daring
Bit Assembly, a product and software development consultancy
whose clients have included the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and e-commerce
startup Shipt, according to Daring Bit Assembly’s website. Adams is a “constitutionalist” who believes in strict
interpretation of the authors’ original intent for the
foundational U.S. document, said one of the people familiar with
company operations. In May 2021, Adams filed a lawsuit in
federal court in Alabama against the state’s governor, a
Republican, and its health officer, alleging that the state’s
mask mandate during the coronavirus pandemic violated the U.S.
and Alabama Constitutions. The case was dismissed in June 2021. Boozer, also a political conservative who previously lived
in Alabama, had collaborated frequently with Adams before
joining Truth Social, according to the source. With Adams in
place to steer the back-end infrastructure of the app, Boozer
brought a strong command of the front-end technology that
touches users, according to that source. The pair kept a low profile despite holding high-ranking
positions at the closely watched venture. Neither Adams nor Boozer disclosed their work at Truth
Social on their LinkedIn profiles, which list numerous other
jobs and ventures from their past. The company did not publicly
announce their hiring. Adams’ and Boozer’s roles were listed in a November investor
presentation as the TMTG technology team’s chief technology
officer and chief product officer - but without their last

Mr Musk’s stake in Twitter is considered a passive investment, which means Mr Musk is a long-term investor that’s looking to minimize his buying and selling of the shares. Yet in recent weeks, Mr Musk has raised questions about free speech on Twitter and if failing to adhere to its basic principles undermines democracy. He has also pondered starting up a rival social media network and industry analysts are skeptical about whether the mercurial CEO would remain on the sidelines for long. “We would expect this passive stake as just the start of broader conversations with the Twitter board/management that could ultimately lead to an active stake and a potential more aggressive ownership role of Twitter,” Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities said in a client note early Monday. Twitter’s stock surged 25% before the opening bell Monday. Early last month, Mr Musk asked a federal judge to nullify a subpoena from securities regulators and throw out a 2018 court agreement in which Mr Musk had to have someone pre-approve his posts on Twitter. U.S. securities regulators said they had legal authority to subpoena Tesla and Mr Musk about his tweets, and that Mr Musk’s move to throw out a 2018 court agreement that his tweets be pre-approved is not valid. Mr Musk’s revelation about his stake in Twitter shares comes two days after Tesla Inc. posted first-quarter delivery numbers.

854,"April 04, 2022",16:10 IST,sci-tech,technology,Today’s Cache | Unionising Amazon," Amazon has made shopping easy and convenient for consumers around the world by selling almost all consumer products via its app. The company’s online interface stands on the foundation of warehouses that drive product delivery. In these delivery centres ‘pickers’ gather goods to fulfil orders. They also label various items, and keep a track of inventory in the unit. One such picker, who joined Amazon in 2015, called out the retailer’s poor labour practices. Chris Smalls worked at the company’s JFK8 warehouse on Staten Island, which now employs about 8,000 workers. Smalls was ousted by the company in 2020, and then he went on to start a labour union. He urged employees to counter Amazon’s plan to disrupt anti-union activities at the company. He used social media to name and shame union-busters to get his message across to a large number of workers. In late March, Amazon’s JFK8 warehouse workers went to vote on whether they should form an union or not. Their demands included increased break and lunch time, higher wages, and safer working conditions. According to data from various sources, the fulfilment centre had a high worker turnover rate, and employee injury at the facility was three times higher than the national average in U.S. The retailer attempted to curtail the movement by removing union-related material from its cafeteria. It pasted its own posters on the walls, urging workers to vote against the formation of an union. But employees at the unit voted by a wide margin to form a labour union. Workers cast 2,654 votes to be represented by Amazon Labour Union (ALU) and 2,131 against, according to the U.S. National Labour Relations Board. This gave the union a margin of more than 10 percentage points, a significant win for Smalls’s call. The victory at JFK8 is pivotal as several labour union leaders see Amazon to be an existential threat to labour standards as it is linked to a wide range of industries. While Amazon sees this win for ALU as a “disappointment”, the strength shown by backers of the union means the retailer could face years of pressure at its other facilities from several labour groups and activists working along with them.",John Xavier,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/todays-cache-unionising-amazon/article65289427.ece

The launch of iOS 14.5 in April 2021 saw the removal of user-level and device-level data for users who opt out of sharing it and pushed the industry towards Apple’s new SKAdNetwork framework on iOS.  Designed as a more privacy-focused approach to campaign measurement, SKAdnetwork made it extremely challenging for mobile marketers to track real-time performance and campaign delivery, the survey found. More than half of the respondents said that they have increased their spend on Android and decreased their spend on iOS. “2021 was a difficult year for mobile marketers. The introduction of app tracking transparency on iOS accelerated the trend of budgetary shift from iOS to Android,” said Christopher Farm, CEO and co-founder of Tenjin.

856,"April 04, 2022",12:03 IST,sci-tech,technology,The chip challenge: Keeping Western semiconductors out of Russian weapons," When Silicon Valley
chipmaker Marvell learned that one of its chips was found in a
Russian surveillance drone recovered in 2016, it set out to
investigate how that came to be. (Sign up to our Technology newsletter, Today’s Cache, for insights on emerging themes at the intersection of technology, business and policy. Click here to subscribe for free.) The chip, which costs less than $2, was shipped in 2009 to a
distributor in Asia, which sold it to another broker in Asia,
which later went out of business. “We couldn’t trace it any further,” Marvell Technology Group
Ltd Chief Operations Officer Chris Koopmans said in a
recent interview. Years later, it reappeared in the drone recovered in
Lithuania. Marvell’s experience is one of a myriad of examples of how
chipmakers lack ability to track where many of their lower-end
products end up, executives and experts said. That could stymie
the enforcement of new U.S. sanctions designed to halt the
export of U.S. technology into Russia. While higher-end sophisticated chips that can build
supercomputers are sold directly to companies, lower-cost
commodity ones that might just control the power often go
through several resellers before they end up in a gadget. The global chip industry is expected to ship 578 billion
chips this year, 64% of them “commodity” chips, said
TechInsights’ chip economist Dan Hutcheson. While Russia accounted for less than 0.1% of global chip
purchases before the sanctions, according to the World
Semiconductor Trade Statistics organisation, new Western
sanctions underscore the threat in human terms. “All those drones we've seen were not armed,” said Damien
Spleeters, deputy director of operations at the European Union-
and Germany-funded Conflict Armament Research group, which found
the chips in the drones. “Some of these drones that we have documented, like the
Forpost, are now used in their armed version in the current
conflict” in Ukraine, he said. The report that prompted Marvell’s tracking work published
late last year by the Conflict Armament Research
also found chips in Russian drones from Intel, NXP, Analog
Devices, Samsung Electronics, Texas Instruments, and
STMicroelectronics. Texas Instruments and STMicroelectronics did not reply to
Reuters for comment; NXP and Analog Devices said they comply
with sanctions; Intel said it’s against its products being used
for human rights violations; and Samsung said it does not make
chips for military purposes. Military weapons such as drones, guided missiles,
helicopters, fighter jets, vehicles and electronic warfare
equipment all need chips and experts say they often use older
chips that are well tested out. Now, under new U.S. sanctions
even some of the most basic chips cannot be shipped to
prohibited Russian entities. For the most sensitive chips, controlled under the
International Traffic in Arms Regulations, the U.S. company
selling them can be held responsible if the chip ends up with an
entity on the U.S. banned list, said Daniel Fisher-Owens, a
specialist on chips and export control and at law firm Berliner
Corcoran & Rowe. Figuring out where chips go is like tracking the flow of
narcotics, experts say. “It’s like the drug business,” said James Lewis, director of
the technology policy program at Washington-based Center for
Strategic and International Studies. “There's cutouts. There's
middlemen. There's money laundering … There's a black market
distribution network.” The point of the Russian sanctions, Lewis said, isn’t to
track every chip, but to disrupt their supply chain, which the
intelligence community has been working on. Finding a solution could take creative technical approaches. ""Knowing where the chips go is probably a very good thing.
You could for example, on every chip put in essentially a public
private key pair, which authenticates it,” and allows it to
work, Eric Schmidt, the former Google chairman, told Reuters in
a recent interview, discussing high-end processors. Marvell says it has a growing number of products supporting
fingerprinting and tracing, and is working with industry
partners and customers to advance this area. The Global
Semiconductor Alliance has proposed its members work on building
a “Trusted IoT Ecosystem Security”
to tag and trace chips, said Tom Katsioulas, technology
executive at the industry group. That may be a lot harder to do for a $2 chip, without making
it prohibitively expensive. The answer could be a matter of
manufacturing process, regulation and, perhaps, will. “Ironically, the technology to do this, all of the things
that we've got in there, the blockchain, the IDs in the device,
this has all been done before for other applications,” said
Michael Ford an executive at Aegis Software who is working with
the industry standards group IPC for better supply chain
security. “All that is needed is that catalyst to make it
happen.” Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could be that catalyst, he
said.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/the-chip-challenge-keeping-western-semiconductors-out-of-russian-weapons/article65289005.ece

858,"April 04, 2022",10:30 IST,sci-tech,technology,NFC technology for instant payments," The story so far: Google Pay has recently launched a new feature in India, ‘Tap to pay for UPI’, in collaboration with Pine Labs. The feature makes use of Near Field Communication (NFC) technology.  The functionality will allow users with NFC-enabled Android smartphones and UPI accounts linked to Google Pay to carry out transactions just by tapping their phones on any Pine Labs Android point-of-sale (POS) terminal across the country, Google said in a release. Till now, Tap to Pay was only available for cards. NFC is a short-range wireless connectivity technology that allows NFC-enabled devices to communicate with each other and transfer information quickly and easily with a single touch — whether to pay bills, exchange business cards, download coupons, or share a document. NFC transmits data through electromagnetic radio fields, to enable communication between two devices. Both devices must contain NFC chips, as transactions take place within a very short distance. NFC-enabled devices must be either physically touching or within a few centimetres from each other for data transfer to occur. Google Pay has been the first among UPI apps to bring the Tap to Pay feature working on POS terminals. It will allow users with UPI accounts configured on Google Pay to make payments just by tapping their NFC-enabled Android smartphones on any Pine Labs Android POS terminal. Once users tap their phones on the POS terminal, it will automatically open the Google pay app with the payment amount pre-filled. Users can then verify the amount and merchant name and authenticate the payment, using their UPI PIN. They will be notified once the payment is successful, Google told The Hindu.  The process is much faster compared to scanning a QR code or entering the UPI-linked mobile number which has been the conventional way till now. In February this year, Apple introduced Tap to Pay on the iPhone. It will allow merchants across the U.S. to use their iPhones to accept Apple Pay, contactless credit and debit cards, and other digital wallets through a tap to their iPhone without the need for any additional hardware or payment terminal. At checkout, the customer just needs to hold their iPhone or Apple Watch to pay with Apple Pay, their contactless credit or debit card, or other digital wallet near the merchant’s iPhone to complete the payment using NFC technology, Apple said in a release earlier. NFC tech has a wide range of applications besides driving payment services like Google Wallet and Apple Pay. It is used in contactless banking cards to perform money transactions or to generate contact-less tickets for public transport. Contactless cards and readers use NFC in several applications from securing networks and buildings to monitoring inventory and sales, preventing auto theft, keeping tabs on library books, and running unmanned toll booths, according to investopedia. NFC is behind the cards that we wave over card readers in subway turnstiles and on buses to check tickets. It is present in speakers, household appliances, and other electronic devices that we monitor and control through our smartphones. With just a touch, NFC can also set up WiFi and Bluetooth devices in our homes, investopedia noted. It also has an application in healthcare, to monitor patient stats through NFC-enabled wristbands. NFC is used in wireless charging too. NFC technology is designed for an operation between devices within a few centimetres from each other. This makes it difficult for attackers to record the communication between the devices compared to other wireless technologies which have a working distance of several metres, according to the NFC forum, a non-profit industry association. The user of the NFC-enabled device determines by the touch gesture which entity the NFC communication should take place with, making it more difficult for the attacker to get connected. The security level of the NFC communication is by default higher compared to other wireless communication protocols.  The NFC Forum has also added Peer to Peer communication which is a mechanism to cipher all exchanged data to avoid external interpretation of recorded communication. Since the receiving device reads your data the instant you send it, NFCs also reduce the chance of human error, according to investopedia. There are other wireless technologies available which are replacing cable-based connections. The IrDa technology is a short range (a few metres) connection based on the exchange of data over infrared light where the two communication devices must be positioned within a line of sight. Today, this technology is mainly used for remote control devices. For larger data communication with computer devices this technology was replaced by Bluetooth or WiFi connections. However, for these technologies’ receiver devices need their own power supply due to the larger working distance. Therefore, the receiving device cannot be powered by the radiofrequency (RF) field like in NFC, the NFC forum highlighted. Another consequence of the larger working distance is the need for the user to configure their device and to pair them together for communication. Connection cannot be initiated by a simple touch gesture like in NFC. In 2004, consumer electronics companies, Nokia, Philips and Sony together formed the NFC Forum, which outlined the architecture for NFC technology to create powerful new consumer-driven products.  Nokia released the first NFC-enabled phone in 2007.",Abhishek Chatterjee,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/nfc-technology-for-instant-payments/article65286681.ece

""This was an *exceptionally* difficult quarter due to supply chain interruptions & China zero Covid policy,"" Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted. ""Outstanding work by Tesla team & key suppliers saved the day."" Tesla delivered 310,048 vehicles in the quarter, a slight increase from the previous quarter, and up 68% from a year earlier. Wall Street had expected deliveries of 308,836 cars, according to Refinitiv data. Tesla produced 305,407 vehicles from January to March, down from 305,840 the previous quarter. Tesla, the world's most valuable automaker, has navigated the pandemic and supply chain disruptions better than rivals and its new Shanghai factory has been driving growth. But a recent spike in COVID-19 cases in China has forced Tesla to temporarily suspend production at the Shanghai factory for several days in March and April as the city locks down to test residents for the disease.  The deliveries were ""better than feared given supply chain issues,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush, in a report. Tesla said it sold a total of 295,324 Model 3 sedans and Model Y sport utility vehicles, while it delivered 14,724 Model S luxury sedans and Model X premium SUVs. Skyrocketing gas prices spurred by the Ukraine crisis is expected to fuel demand for electric cars, but lack of inventory and higher vehicle prices would weigh on sales, analysts said. Tesla in March raised prices in China and the United States after Musk said the U.S. electric carmaker was facing significant inflationary pressure in raw materials and logistics after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""Impressive (deliveries) given all the headwinds,"" Gene Munster, managing partner at venture capital firm Loup Ventures, said, adding he expected Tesla to continue outperforming other automakers in sales growth. Toyota and GM, Hyundai Motor on Friday reported lower first-quarter U.S. sales than a year earlier. Musk said in October that Shanghai had surpassed its Fremont, California factory - the company's first plant - in output. The two factories are critical for Tesla's goal to boost deliveries by 50% this year, as production at its new factories are expected to ramp up slowly in their first year. Tesla started delivering vehicles made at its factory in Gruenheide, Germany, in March and deliveries of cars made at its plant in Austin, Texas, were to begin in the near future.

863,"April 01, 2022",12:14 IST,sci-tech,technology,Giga-casting and robots: How Volkswagen’s Trinity aims to catch up with Tesla," As Tesla kicks off production
at its new German plant this month, Volkswagen is weeks away
from finalising plans for a 2 billion euro ($2.2 billion)
electric vehicle (EV) factory that it hopes will bring it up to
speed with its U.S. rival. (Sign up to our Technology newsletter, Today’s Cache, for insights on emerging themes at the intersection of technology, business and policy. Click here to subscribe for free.) Tesla says it can already churn out a Model Y in 10
hours at its new Giga Berlin-Brandenburg factory in Gruenheide
near the German capital, whereas it can take Volkswagen
three times as long to make its ID.3 electric car. The German auto giant now aims to slash production times
with its ""Trinity"" EV plant, which should be up and running in
2026, by using techniques such as large die casting and cutting
the number of components in its cars by several hundred. ""Our goal is clear: we want to set the standard with our
production,"" Volkswagen brand production chief Christian Vollmer
told Reuters in an interview. ""If we can get to 10 hours, we
have achieved something big."" The carmaker has been improving productivity at a rate of
about 5% a year but must take bigger leaps to keep its upper
hand in the European market, Vollmer said, without providing a
new percentage target. Volkswagen, the world's second-biggest carmaker behind
Japan's Toyota with a stable of brands from Skoda, Seat and VW
to Audi, Porsche and Bentley has a 25% share of the European EV
market, ahead of Tesla on 13%. But the pressure on German carmakers to both master and ramp
up EV production has been intensified by Tesla's presence in the
country and Volkswagen Chief Executive Herbert Diess has warned
Germans must speed up to avoid getting beaten on their own turf. Volkswagen's goals align with a wider trend in the industry
of simplifying product ranges and streamlining production as
carmakers scramble to find the cash to fund the electric
transition - and keep up with rivals like Tesla that don't have
to juggle making EVs as well as cars with combustion engines. ""Tesla really ignited the drive for reducing part counts and
making simpler products,"" Evan Horetsky, a partner at McKinsey
who was formerly in charge of engineering at Tesla's new
Brandenburg plant, said. ""Legacy manufacturers have a more
difficult time because they have to maintain current orders."" A Tesla spokesperson said one of the reasons it can produce
its Model Y vehicles in Germany within a 10-hour time frame is
because it is uses two giant casting presses, or giga-presses,
applying 6,000 tonnes of pressure to make the rear of the car. Its Gruenheide press shop can produce 17 components in under
six minutes. With six more giga-presses on the way, Tesla will
soon be making the front of the car with the giga-press too. ""That's why we're so fast,"" the spokesperson said. The giga-casting technique that VW plans to adopt was
popularised by Tesla as an alternative to the more
labour-intensive method of assembling multiple stamped metal
panels with crumple zones to absorb energy during a crash. German luxury carmaker BMW has rejected large
castings in the past on the grounds that the higher costs of
repair outweigh the lower manufacturing costs. But advocates say automated driving technology will reduce
the frequency of accidents: ""Tesla is designing a vehicle that
most likely won't be in a severe crash,"" Cory Steuben, president
of manufacturing consulting firm Munro & Associates, said. While VW can produce certain models such as the Tiguan or
Polo in 18 and 14 hours in Germany and Spain respectively, its
electric ID.3 - made in a factory juggling six models from three
Volkswagen brands - still takes 30 hours to put together. At the Trinity plant, multiple work steps will be condensed
into one through automation, shrinking the size of the body shop
and reducing the number of jobs requiring uncomfortable physical
labour, Vollmer said, dubbing it an expansion of ""human-robot
cooperation"". Volkswagen does not plan to have giga-presses at the new
plant in Wolfsburg and will instead use the equipment at its
factory in Kassel about 160 km (100 miles) away and transport
the products by train. U.S. investment bank JPMorgan predicts that Tesla's
Gruenheide factory will produce about 54,000 cars in 2022,
280,000 in 2023 and then 500,000 by 2025. Volkswagen, which delivered some 452,000 battery-electric
vehicles globally last year, has not yet set an output target
for Trinity, which will use its Scalable Systems Platform. It aims to build 40 million vehicles worldwide on the new
platform - which combines multiple internal combustion engine
and electric platforms into one – with half of its global output
all-electric by 2030. Tesla, which produced 936,000 cars last year, has said it
aims to put 20 million on the road a year by the end of the
decade, or roughly double the current annual production of
Toyota, the world's biggest carmaker now. Still, Tesla can expect numerous challenges as it expands in
Germany, from securing more water supplies to environmental
groups angry about light pollution and congestion near the plant
to unions worried about a management-heavy works council and
wages being driven down by workers coming in from elsewhere. ""Starting production is nice, but volume production is the
hard part,"" Musk told a cheering audience at a festival at the

864,"April 01, 2022",11:54 IST,sci-tech,technology,EU lawmakers back new tracing rule for crypto transfers," European Union lawmakers backed
new safeguards for tracing transfers of bitcoin and other
cryptocurrencies on Thursday, in the latest sign that regulators
are tightening up on the freewheeling sector. (Sign up to our Technology newsletter, Today’s Cache, for insights on emerging themes at the intersection of technology, business and policy. Click here to subscribe for free.) Two committees in the European Parliament jointly voted by
93 in favour and 14 against on cross-party compromises which
crypto exchange Coinbase Global Inc warned would usher
in a surveillance regime that stifles innovation. The $2.1 trillion crypto sector is still subject to patchy
regulation across the world. Under the draft law first put forward last year by the EU's
executive European Commission, crypto firms such as exchanges
would have to obtain, hold, and submit information on those
involved in transfers. That would make is easier to identify and report suspicious
transactions, freeze digital assets, and discourage high-risk
transactions, said Ernest Urtasun, a Spanish Green Party
lawmaker helping to steer the measure through the parliament. Currently there are no EU requirements for tracing crypto
transfers and the Commission had proposed applying the new rule
to transfers worth 1,000 euros ($1,116) or more, but lawmakers
on Thursday voted to scrap the 'de minimis' threshold, meaning
all transfers would be in scope. Urtasun said removing the threshold brought the draft law
into line with rules from the global Financial Action Task Force
that sets standards for combating money laundering. Those rules
mean crypto firms must collect and share data on transactions. The lawmakers' committees also backed putting transfers from
'unhosted' crypto wallets held by individuals, not exchanges,
under the tracing rule, and on the creation of a list by the
EU's European Banking Authority of high-risk or non-compliant
cryptoasset service providers. Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal said in a blog on
Monday that traditional cash, not crypto, was by far the most
popular way to hide financial crime. EU states have joint say with parliament on the draft law
and representatives from both parties will now meet to agree a
final version. Countries have already agreed among themselves
there should be no de minimis.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/eu-lawmakers-back-new-tracing-rule-for-crypto-transfers/article65280725.ece
865,"April 01, 2022",11:43 IST,sci-tech,technology,Taiwan puppeteers look to NFTs to keep their art alive," A group of Taiwanese
puppeteers are looking to use non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, to
help bring their traditional art form into the modern era and
keep it relevant for a new audience. (Sign up to our Technology newsletter, Today’s Cache, for insights on emerging themes at the intersection of technology, business and policy. Click here to subscribe for free.) NFTs are crypto assets representing a digital item such as
an image, video, or even land in virtual worlds, with prices of
some rising so fast last year that speculators around the world
sometimes ""flipped"" them within days for a profit. Pili International Multimedia, which makes
Taiwan's longest-running television show featuring the puppets
at its studio in central Taiwan's Yunlin County, says it wants
to use NFTs as another source of revenue. ""The sort of imagination everyone nowadays has for the
online world is developing so fast that we are almost unable to
grasp it,"" said Seika Huang, Pili's brand director. ""Instead of sitting on the sidelines, the best approach is
to go ahead and understand fully what's going on. This is the
fastest way to catch up."" Pili has thousands of glove puppet characters, a traditional
part of Taiwanese street entertainment culture spinning
colourful and highly stylised stories of heroic courage and
romance, often with martial arts. The puppets are painstakingly created, and expertly
manoeuvred during the filming of the shows, with costumes that
are sewn on and strands of hair meticulously put in place. Pili said four of their puppet characters were made into
digital versions and 30,000 sets have been sold as NFTs. The company declined to reveal the profit-sharing with the
market platform, but said prices for each set started at $40,
translating to generated revenue of at least $1.2 million, since
their listing in early February. Marketing technology company VeVe, which is in charge of
selling the NFTs, said the stories of the puppet heroes
resonates with a younger crowd and could draw in foreign fans of
super hero films, such as those based on characters from Marvel
Comics. ""Westerners actually really like our martial arts heroes and
kung-fu,"" said VeVe's brand manager Raymond Chou. Huang, who said their initial listings had sold out seconds
after launching on VeVe, is now working on transforming up to 50
other puppet characters into NFTs, potentially adding another
million-dollar revenue stream for the studio.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/taiwan-puppeteers-look-to-nfts-to-keep-their-art-alive/article65280679.ece

The company says its Arc graphics product family would enable high-performance graphics experiences for gamers and creators. (Sign up to our Technology newsletter, Today’s Cache, for insights on emerging themes at the intersection of technology, business and policy. Click here to subscribe for free.) The chipmaker revealed the first Arc 3 GPUs – A350M and A370M, which are said to offer enhanced 1080p gaming and advanced content creation. Intel’s Arc 3 graphics will be followed by its Arc 5 and Arc 7 products, which according to the company, would offer the same content-creation capabilities coupled with increased graphics and computing performance. The California-based firm said that the Arc A-Series GPUs are built on its new Xe High Performance Graphics (Xe HPG) microarchitecture, which was engineered from the ground up for gamers and creators. The A350M has six Xe-cores and six ray tracing units, and the A370M comes with eight Xe-cores and eight ray tracing units. Both GPUs will come with 4GB GDDR6 (64-bit) memory configurations. The graphics power range for the A350M is 25-35W and that of the A370M is 35-50W. The Arc 5 and Arc 7 graphics products would have more Xe-cores, more ray tracing units, more GDDR6 memory compared with Arc 3 products, and will be unveiled later this year.  Intel’s Xe HPG includes artificial intelligence (AI) engines to provide increased compute capability to complete AI inferencing operations and help deliver performance boosts in productivity, gaming and creator workloads, the company noted. Additionally, the microarchitecture’s media engine is said to support acceleration for a broad set of video codecs and standards and includes industry-first AV1 hardware-accelerated encoding and decoding. According to Intel, the Xe HPG’s display engine is capable of handling high-resolution, high refresh rate HDR displays, supporting the latest standards, including Display Port 2.0 10G for 4K at 120hz uncompressed. On the gaming front, the company says that the Arc GPUs – from Arc 3 to Arc 7 – will fully support DirectX 12 Ultimate and advanced gaming technologies such as hardware-accelerated ray tracing, as well as Xe Super Sampling, which is an AI-based image upscaling technology. Intel says its Deep Link technology will allow the Arc GPUs to work seamlessly with its CPUs with integrated graphics to boost performance for gaming, creating and streaming. The technology features dynamic power share, which intelligently and automatically prioritises engine performance depending on the workload by sending more power to the Intel core processor or Intel Arc graphics product as needed, the company explained. The chipmaker has also developed an Arc Control app, which is said to be a seamless interface and all-in-one hub that puts users in control of the gaming experience. Its features include custom performance profiles, built-in streaming, a virtual camera, integrated Game ON Driver downloading, automatic game capture, among others. Intel’s launch of the Arc A-Series graphics marks an important step in the company’s journey as it takes on rivals like Nvidia and AMD which have established themselves in the GPU space, with a wide range of products designed for different categories of devices. The Arc 3 GPUs will be first available with the Samsung Galaxy Book2 Pro, Intel said. It also promises to offer Arc GPUs with brands like Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, MSI, Lenovo, among others, in the future. Besides, the firm noted it plans to introduce desktop and workstation graphic products later this year.",Ishan Patra,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/intel-launches-first-arc-gpus-for-laptops/article65280621.ece
868,"April 01, 2022",10:01 IST,sci-tech,technology,WWF report says online wildlife trade on rise in Myanmar," A report by the World Wildlife Fund shows illegal purchases of wildlife online are growing in Myanmar in a threat both to public health and to endangered species. The report released on Friday found that enforcement of bans on such transactions has weakened amid political turmoil following a 2021 military takeover. 
“With Asia’s track record as a breeding ground for many recent zoonotic diseases, this sharp uptick in online trade of wildlife in Myanmar is extremely concerning”Shaun Martin, Head of WWF’s Asia-Pacific regional cybercrime project The number of such dealings rose 74 per cent over a year earlier to 11,046, nearly all of them involving sales of live animals. For the 173 species traded, 54 are threatened with global extinction, the report said. Researchers identified 639 Facebook accounts belonging to wildlife traders. The largest online trading group had more than 19,000 members and dozens of posts per week, it said. The animals bought and sold included elephants, bears and gibbons, Tibetan antelope, critically endangered pangolins and an Asian giant tortoise. The most popular were various species of monkeys, often bought as pets. Most of the animals advertised for sale were taken from the wild. They also included civets, which along with pangolins have been identified as potential vectors in the spread of diseases such as SARS and COVID-19. Shaun Martin, who heads the WWF’s Asia-Pacific regional cybercrime project, said monitoring of the online wildlife trade shows different species being kept close together, sometimes in the same cage. “With Asia’s track record as a breeding ground for many recent zoonotic diseases, this sharp uptick in online trade of wildlife in Myanmar is extremely concerning,” he said. The unregulated trade in wild species and resulting interactions between wild species and humans raise the risks of new and possibly vaccine-resistant mutations of illnesses such as the COVID-19 that could evolve undetected in non-human hosts into more dangerous variants of disease, experts say. COVID-19 is one of many diseases traced back to animals. The killing and sale of what is known as bushmeat in Africa was thought to be a source for Ebola. Bird flu likely came from chickens at a market in Hong Kong in 1997. Measles is believed to have evolved from a virus that infected cattle. “Illegal wildlife trade is a serious concern from the point of view of biodiversity preservation and conservation and its potential impact on health security,” said Mary Elizabeth G. Miranda, an expert on zoonotic diseases and illness and CEO of the Field Epidemiology Training Program Alumni Foundation in the Philippines. Social media and other online platforms have joined a worldwide effort to crack down on the thriving trade in birds, reptiles, mammals and animal parts. In Myanmar, much of the trade in wildlife is through Facebook, which as a member of the Coalition to End Wildlife Trafficking online has taken action to block or remove accounts of people engaged in such transactions. But as is true elsewhere, new accounts often pop up just as soon as old ones are shut down, hindering enforcement, the report noted. Easy online access to the animals also is driving up demand, worsening the problem. Discussions of purchases of protected species often took place in open Facebook groups, suggesting that such dealings remain “largely risk-free,” the report said. Since payments and deliveries often are done using messenger apps, controlling the problem is doubly difficult. Highlighting the lack of enforcement, people in the illegal wildlife trade in Myanmar often use rudimentary methods of moving the animals and animal products around — with buses being the usual form of transport. The study by WWF in Myanmar focused on trade online of animals and other creatures inside the country, though there were some imports from neighbouring Thailand, mainly of birds such as hornbills and salmon crested cockatoos, and of crocodiles, to India. Some deals might involve animals or parts being sent into China, it said.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/wwf-report-says-online-wildlife-trade-on-rise-in-myanmar/article65280589.ece

The revamp will offer hundreds of games for a flat monthly fee, and is scheduled to be launched in the U.S., Europe and Japan in June. The move will combine PlayStation’s Plus and Now services, and offer online gaming coupled with a few free titles to subscribers. The two services have a combined subscriber base of roughly 51 million users.  While Sony is leading the console-based gaming pack, selling 17 million PS5 units, Microsoft is aggressively developing its Game Pass service, which has over 25 million subscribers. The Windows maker has also agreed to buy Activision Blizzard for $70 billion, which will add several popular titles to its growing list of games. The future of the gaming industry is in the cloud, which explains why large tech firms are investing in subscription-based models. Unlike console or PC-based games, cloud-based games do not require downloading or installing.  This change in the market is a potential threat to console makers, which includes Microsoft’s own Xbox consoles. But Microsoft has the lead on cloud-based gaming as the software-maker’s subscriptions accounts for 60% of the games subscriptions in North America and Europe, compared with 7% for Sony, according to Ampere Analysis cited by Reuters.

cryptocurrency worth almost $615 million from a blockchain
project linked to the popular online game Axie Infinity, in the
latest cyberheist to hit the digital asset sector. (Sign up to our Technology newsletter, Today’s Cache, for insights on emerging themes at the intersection of technology, business and policy. Click here to subscribe for free.) Ronin, a network that allows the transfer of crypto coins
across different blockchains, said on Tuesday that hackers stole
on March 23 some 173,600 ether tokens and 25.5 million USD Coin
tokens. At the time of the announcement, the loot was worth around
$615 million - and, due to a change in the value of the tokens,
some $540 million at the time of the hack - making the theft one
of the largest on record. Here are some of the other major thefts to have plagued the
crypto sector since bitcoin was born in 2008. Hackers stole around $610 million in August 2021 from Poly
Network, a platform that facilitates peer-to-peer token
transactions. The hackers behind the heist later returned nearly
all of the stolen funds. The hack underscored vulnerabilities in the burgeoning
decentralised finance - DeFi - sector, where users lend, borrow
and save in digital tokens, bypassing the traditional
gatekeepers of finance such as banks and exchanges. In Jan. 2018, hackers stole cryptocurrency then worth around
$530 million from Tokyo-based exchange Coincheck. The thieves
attacked one of Coincheck's ""hot wallet"" - a digital folder
stored online - to drain the funds, drawing attention to
security at exchanges. The hack raised questions in Japan
about regulation of the digital asset market. South Korea's
intelligence agency said at the time that a North Korean hacking
group may have been behind the heist. In one of the earliest and most-high profile crypto hacks,
bitcoin worth close to $500 million dollars was stolen from the
Mt.Gox exchange in Tokyo - then the world's biggest - between
2011 and 2014. Mt.Gox, which once handled 80% of the world's bitcoin trade,
filed for bankruptcy in early 2014 after the hack was revealed,
with some 24,000 customers losing access to their funds. DeFi site Wormhole was hit by a $320 million heist last
month, with the hackers making off with 120,000 digital tokens
connected to the second-largest cryptocurrency, ether. The crypto arm of Chicago-based Jump Trading, which had the
year before acquired the developer behind Wormhole, later
replaced the funds ""to make community members whole and support

all ties with Russia, the U.S. software behemoth would continue
doing business in the country with non-sanctioned clients,
including schools and hospitals. (Sign up to our Technology newsletter, Today’s Cache, for insights on emerging themes at the intersection of technology, business and policy. Click here to subscribe for free.) ""Depriving these institutions of software updates and
services could put at risk the health and safety of innocent
civilians, including children and the elderly,"" Smith said in
the previously unreported March 14 letter, seen by Reuters. Smith told President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that Microsoft was
""mindful of the moral responsibility"" to protect civilians.
However, he said the company was discussing with U.S., British
and EU governments whether ""to halt any ongoing services and
support"" in Russia and would move ""in lockstep with their
sanctions and other economic goals."" Asked about the exchange, spokespeople for both Microsoft
and Ukraine said a constructive dialogue was underway about
actions to support the country. The decision by some leading Western business technology
makers - including Microsoft, German software multinational SAP
SE and U.S. giant International Business Machines Corp
- to maintain operations or staff in Russia despite
Ukraine's appeals have angered their workers in several
countries. Small groups of employees at Microsoft, SAP and IBM have
called for management to withdraw fully from Russia in the wake
of its invasion of Ukraine, according to comments seen by
Reuters on internal discussion forums and interviews with 18
workers familiar with the companies, who sought anonymity
because they were not authorized to speak publicly. The employees – echoing Ukrainian officials – have urged the
companies to go beyond ending new sales and dropping sanctioned
clients in order to increase economic pressure on Moscow. They
want their companies to suspend every deal in Russia, including
for software clients may use to track sales, supply chains and
workforces. Asked about the internal criticism, IBM said it has ceased
working with Russian companies anywhere in the world - though it
has stopped short of layoffs or suspending support of foreign
businesses in Russia. SAP told Reuters it was complying with government actions
and even going beyond them, and it would ""welcome new sanctions
currently under discussion."" SAP responded to Ukraine's requests to cut all ties in
Russia with a previously undisclosed letter this month to
President Zelenskiy – reviewed in part by Reuters – saying that
it was supporting essential Russian services, including
""hospitals, civilian infrastructure and food supply chains."" The three companies have not ruled out further pullback. But
for now, their employees in Russia are getting paid and
accessing workplace tools, colleagues said. Local phone numbers
are active for all three, Reuters found. Questioned about the demands on Western tech businesses from
their own workers and the Ukrainian government to quit Russia, a
Kremlin spokesperson said that ""some companies are leaving,
others are staying. New ones will come in their place."" The spokesperson noted that companies had legal obligations
to employees that must be fulfilled, such as paying wages. Russian prosecutors have warned some Western businesses that
their staff could face arrests if production of essential goods
was stopped, according to media reports. The Wall
Street Journal named IBM among those warned. The Kremlin spokesperson denied the reports about pressure
on companies from prosecutors: ""The part about arrests is a
lie."" Ukraine Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov, one of the
leading campaigners for a digital blockade, said Russia was
already feeling the impact as some technology companies exit,
such as developers of digital payment and web development tools.
But he is pushing for a complete departure. ""We will keep trying until those companies have made the
decision to leave Russia,"" he said. Fedorov's team told Reuters last week that a ""huge number""
of Russian organizations have contracts for SAP's software,
including major banking and energy companies. Reuters could not
independently confirm SAP's customers in Russia, and SAP said it
was in full compliance with sanctions. Russia's Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and
Mass Media did not answer requests for comment on the impact of
departures by Western technology companies, nor the extent of
SAP's footprint in the country. Mirroring the Ukrainian government's message, SAP's five
salespeople for Ukraine told regional managers on a call March
18 that the company must end support for remaining Russian
clients, according to a person familiar with the discussion. Fedorov said on Friday in a tweet, citing a conversation
with SAP Chief Executive Christian Klein, that the company would
""gradually stop supporting"" products in Russia. A day earlier,
SAP had said it was shutting its Russian cloud business, which
two sources described as a small operation. In a March 23 letter sent to customers in Russia, reviewed
by Reuters, SAP asked cloud clients to advise whether their data
in the Russian cloud should be deleted, handed back to them or
moved outside the country. SAP confirmed the content of the letter, and said that
Fedorov and Klein spoke. It declined to comment further. At IBM, hundreds of workers criticized the company's
response to Russia's invasion, three people with knowledge of
internal messages said. CEO Arvind Krishna on a March 2 call with employees had
taken no sides on the war, one of the sources said. In a
now-public message to workers the previous day, IBM had referred
to what it described as the ""deteriorating situation involving
Ukraine and Russia."" One comment on an internal discussion forum, seen by
Reuters, called on the CEO to read a book on IBM's work during
the Holocaust describing how https://ibmandtheholocaust.com the
company designed punch-card machines that Nazi Germany used to
track Jewish people: ""Think carefully and do the right thing -
pull IBM and IBMer's in Russia out of Russia,"" the employee
wrote. IBM declined to comment on the remark. Responding to the outcry, Krishna announced in a March 3
post a suspension of sales in Russia and condemned ""the Russian
war in Ukraine."" On March 7, he went further, saying that IBM
had suspended ""all business"" in Russia – without elaborating. An IBM spokesperson told Reuters March 24 that the business
suspension meant the company is no longer providing ""goods,
parts, software, services, consulting and technology"" anywhere
in the world to Russian clients. Several Microsoft workers on internal chat tools have also
demanded the company exit Russia altogether, with some even
telling senior management they would quit otherwise, an employee
said. Microsoft declined to comment. Some workers told Reuters they have not joined the calls for
full exits due to doubts over harming civilians and how strong
an impact the companies' withdrawal from Russia would have. For instance, the United States on Feb. 24 sanctioned
Russian Railways, a state-owned company operating passenger and
freight trains. IBM that day placed the company on its “Denied
Parties List” and stopped tech support, according to an IBM
letter to Ukrainian minister Fedorov dated March 5, seen by
Reuters. Denied parties cannot access official replacement discs,
adapters and memory for mainframes that a former IBM salesperson
said need swapping every two years. But a person familiar with operations at Russian Railways
said it can run for years without aid. Russian Railways did not respond to requests for comment.
IBM declined to comment. SAP also told Reuters that because some clients have its
software installed on their machines they can keep using it
regardless of the company's decision not to provide support.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/tech-workers-urge-companies-to-join-ukraines-digital-blockade-of-russia/article65276935.ece

877,"March 31, 2022",10:30 IST,sci-tech,technology,The Facebook clean-up attempt on political messaging," The story so far: In a blogpost on March 27, Facebook’s parent company Meta stated that it can anticipate threats and help prevent interference in elections better than before. It added that the platform’s focus on strengthening artificial intelligence and machine learning systems among other tools made it more effective at finding and removing abuse and fake accounts. Further, to ensure a level playing field, Meta extended the use of all advertising tools, previously available only to large entities, to entities of all sizes.  The Ad auction: Meta said ad pricing on its platforms vary as per the entity’s targeting and bid strategy. It informed the auction does not make pricing decisions based on political viewpoints. “The assertion that any political party in India got discounted rates on ads because of their political affiliation is factually inaccurate,” the blog stated. In January, Facebook decided to do away with some of its ‘detailed targeting’ options that let the advertisers refine their target audience. It informed that broad targeting along with customised and lookalike audience targeting options would continue to exist.   Disclaimers: Political ads on Facebook and Instagram are required to be mandatorily authorised and must include disclaimers as well. This enables users to note the name of the person or organisation running the ads. The advertisers are required to verify their credentials to increase their accountability. “For example, if we discover that the phone, email or website are no longer active or valid, we will inform the advertiser to update them. If they do not, they will no longer be able to use that disclaimer to run ads about elections or politics,” the blog read.   Removing and demoting content: Meta announced that all political advertisements violative of their policies and standards, including those flagged by the Election Commission of India and scrutinised by them, will not be allowed to stay on their platforms. Separately, prior to the recently concluded State elections in five States of India, it had stated that if content, even though not violative of its standards but could potentially cause offline harm becomes widespread, it will be demoted so fewer people can see it.  Coordinated Inauthentic Behaviour: This refers to coordinated actions at a large scale aimed at influencing public opinions to achieve a strategic social or political goal. Fake accounts are usually central to such operations. Meta stated it accords focus on behaviour and not content when determining deceptive campaigns. “...in many cases the content shared by influence operations isn’t verifiably false and may in fact be copied from authentic communities these deceptive campaigns are trying to mimic or reach,” the blog stated. The blog informed that it has been working on technologies to detect and block fake accounts, which are the source of a lot of inauthentic activity.   Virality: Meta said it does not tweak its algorithms to suit a particular user. The feed is essentially shaped by choices and actions of the individual user. “It is made up primarily of content from the friends and family they choose to connect to on the platform, the Pages they choose to follow, and the Groups they choose to join. Ranking is then the process of using algorithms to order that content,” the blog stated.  Language: Meta’s blogpost stated that it has content reviewers in 20 Indian languages. There has been $13 billion worth of investment which helped the company triple the size of its global team working on safety and security to over 40,000 including 15,000+ dedicated reviewers across 70 languages.   Facebook stated that any advertiser publishing advertisements concerning social issues, elections or politics and are located in the designated country must complete Meta’s authorisation process. The rules do not apply for news publishers.   The direct (or proxy) entities are required to comply with requirement pertaining to disclaimer, labelling, blackout periods, foreign interference or spending limits and reporting requirements. As for authorisation, they are required to confirm their primary location, and upload a government photo ID such as passport, driving licence etc. After this, the entity would be required to put forth the list of accounts that would be used to fund its ads. Failure to comply with Meta’s provisions or furnishing misleading information during authentication may impart restrictions such as unpublishing of associated pages, disabling existing advertisements and revoking permission to publish new ads.   Meta barred all advertising about the Georgia runoff elections on its platform, with effect from January 6 the previous year. This was not the first time that Meta imposed an advertising blackout. This was first implemented in the runup to the election day in United States. Meta had barred all campaigners from publishing new advertisements a week before. “We know it’s important that campaigns are able to run get out the vote campaigns, but in the final days of an election there may not be enough time to contest new claims, which is why we aren’t accepting new political or issue ads in the final week,” it stated.  However, the campaigners allowed the existing advertisements to continue running. On March 28, officials of the social media platform Facebook were answering queries laid out by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information and Technology. The allegations laid out against them concern the partisan use of their algorithms to favour one political party. They were also questioned on the spread of hate content and the lack of Indian language experts for quality check. The company’s representatives, in their defence, said the algorithms only determine the comparative performance of the ads, denying allegations of any intervention by the company, a source informed  The Hindu. It added that the platform does not differentiate between political and non-political advertisements.  ",Saptaparno Ghosh,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/the-facebook-clean-up-attempt-on-political-messaging/article65274852.ece

(Sign up to our Technology newsletter, Today’s Cache, for insights on emerging themes at the intersection of technology, business and policy. Click here to subscribe for free.) The acquisition would accelerate HP’s strategy to create a more growth-oriented portfolio, and further strengthen its industry opportunity in hybrid work solutions, it said in a statement. Poly, formerly known as Plantronics, offers headsets, video and audio-conferencing products, desk phones, analytics software and services. Together, the firms will deliver a complete ecosystem of devices, software, and digital services, HP said, adding, Poly’s acquisition will help drive the growth and scale of its peripherals and workforce solutions businesses. Peripherals represent a $110 billion segment opportunity growing 9% annually, and workforce solutions represent a $120 billion segment opportunity that is growing 8% annually, HP noted. The rise of hybrid work is creating a sustained demand for technology that enables seamless collaboration across home and office environments. Last year, HP acquired Teradici, a remote computing software firm, to enhance its capabilities in the personal systems category for hybrid work. The company also bought HyperX, a developer of gaming peripherals and console accessories, to drive growth in its personal systems business. About 75% of office workers are investing to improve their home setups to support new ways of working, according to an HP survey. Besides, traditional office spaces are also being reconfigured to support hybrid work and collaboration, with a focus on meeting room solutions. Consequently, the office meeting room solutions segment is expected to triple by 2024, as per a report by Frost & Sullivan. The deal is expected to close by the end of calendar 2022, HP said, adding it will finance the transaction through a combination of balance sheet cash and new debt.",Ishan Patra,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/hp-to-buy-poly-in-a-bid-to-strengthen-hybrid-work-solutions/article65275316.ece

During the question hour in the Lok Sabha, the Minister said there is no law or rule that allows for mandatory verification of users who use the social media platforms. However, the IT rules that were promulgated in February, 2021 “very effectively cast an obligation on the intermediaries to be able to detect and identify the first originator of any criminal activity”. “That is the obligation which has been cast through the subordinate legislation and while that matter has been challenged by some intermediaries, the government is robustly defending its position that this anonymity cannot be a blanket one and first origination should be possible as an obligation on the intermediaries.” The Minister said the government will continue to expand the scope of this kind of rulemaking to ensure that the Internet is safe and trusted. “Today, there are over 80 crore Indians using online platforms and this number is expected to reach 120 crore in the next few years…voluntary verification is not aimed to be a deterrent. It is aimed at encouraging the intermediaries to do due diligence on those who are using their platforms,” he said.",Yuthika Bhargava,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/govt-does-not-intend-to-make-social-media-users-verification-mandatory-minister-rajeev-chandrasekhar/article65273794.ece
880,"March 30, 2022",17:02 IST,sci-tech,technology,Microsoft’s to-be gaming partner gets cleaner," Microsoft is betting big on gaming. Earlier this year, the tech giant agreed to buy a troubled gaming company Activision Blizzard in an all-cash deal valued at nearly $70 billion.  The deal, if completed, would be CEO Satya Nadella’s biggest ever acquisition since he took the helm of the software company in 2014. It also marks a directional shift for the powerhouse in business computing and a rising videogames giant. The transaction will enable the world’s second-highest valuable company to deepen its roots in the gaming industry by adding a bulk of popular game franchises including Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush from Activision’s stables. These titles, along with the software maker’s own, like Minecraft and Doom, could be accessed by Microsoft customers, both on smartphones and Xbox consoles. According to Microsoft, the deal would make it the third-largest gaming company, after China’s Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Japan’s Sony Group Corp. It will also enable the software maker to get a stronghold in the mobile gaming market where it barely competes at the moment. But, the move to become part of a Microsoft entity came at an important time for Activision. The gaming company faced accusations that its senior executives ignored discrimination complaints at the organisation.  In July, California regulators filed a lawsuit against Activision based on complaints that the videogame maker paid its female employees less than their male counterparts and provided them with fewer opportunities to advance in their roles. Five months later, in November, the company announced that it reached a $18 million settlement.  On Tuesday, Judge Dale Fischer approved the settlement reached by the gaming company and the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). As part of the consent decree, Activision would establish an $18 million settlement fund, which will be used to compensate victims of harassment and discrimination. Employees who have worked at the company between September 1st, 2016 and Tuesday, March 29th, can submit a claim for “for sexual harassment, pregnancy discrimination, or related retaliation.” Apart from this, the gaming company’s supervisors are required to attend training programmes on discrimination and harassment. The decree will remain in effect for three years. While Activision gets legally clean by this decree, the harassment its women employees underwent is still in need of a catharsis.",John Xavier,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/microsofts-to-be-gaming-partner-gets-cleaner/article65273890.ece

said on Tuesday it was suspending plans to build a giant data
centre in the Netherlands, following political opposition. (Sign up to our Technology newsletter, Today’s Cache, for insights on emerging themes at the intersection of technology, business and policy. Click here to subscribe for free.) The move comes a week after the Dutch Senate passed a motion
asking Prime Minister Mark Rutte's government to ""use its
powers"" to temporarily block construction of the site in the
northern town of Zeewolde, 50 km east of Amsterdam. ""Given the current circumstances, we have decided to pause
our development efforts in Zeewolde,"" a company spokesperson
said in a statement. The town in December had approved plans to build the largest
facility of its kind in the Netherlands, from which Facebook,
Instagram and WhatsApp would serve users across Europe. It would use 1.38 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity and
cover 166 hectares (410 acres) of farmland, and was expected to
run on green energy and create 400 permanent jobs. It was, however, opposed by some environmental campaigners
who do not want the limited supply of sustainable power
generated in the Netherlands to be used by a multinational
company. Some residents of Zeewolde said they felt their voices
had not been heard in the permitting process. The Senate motion asked the government to delay construction
until a government policy on data centres had been agreed. “After having been invited in 2019 by the local, provincial
and national government to consider a data center investment in

884,"March 30, 2022",12:02 IST,sci-tech,technology,Sony launches Game Pass counterattack with subscription service upgrade," Sony Group Corp's
revamp of its PlayStation subscription service is a
major step toward levelling the playing field with Microsoft's
rival Game Pass, although holding back new releases may dampen
enthusiasm, analysts say. (Sign up to our Technology newsletter, Today’s Cache, for insights on emerging themes at the intersection of technology, business and policy. Click here to subscribe for free.) Sony said its expanded PlayStation Plus service will offer
hundreds of games, including recent hits such as ""Spider-Man:
Miles Morales"", for a flat monthly fee when it launches in the
United States, Europe and Japan in June. The service will not include new releases, Sony Interactive
Entertainment CEO Jim Ryan told Reuters, but users can still
find big-budget titles such as ""Returnal"" and ""God of War"". ""There will be more from PlayStation Studios, and all of the
major publishers will be represented,"" Ryan said. Sony is widely seen as leading in the console war, selling
17 million PlayStation 5 (PS5) units even as chip shortages hitproduction, but has been under pressure to respond to the growth
of Netflix-style game subscription services. The revamped Sony service combines the current PlayStation
Plus, which has 48 million subscribers and offers online gaming
and only a few free games each month, with PlayStation Now,
which has 3.2 million users and a library of games to download
and stream. There are three tiers, priced at $9.99 to $17.99 monthly or
$59.99 to $119.99 annually. The lowest-price tier, PlayStation
Plus Essential, looks like Sony's current offering. PlayStation Plus Extra adds a catalogue of PS4 and PS5
games. PlayStation Plus Premium offers a further library of
older titles, cloud streaming in major markets and time-limited
game trials. Such streamlining is ""overdue"", said Lewis Ward, head of
gaming research at IDC. ""The number of PlayStation subscribers in the higher two
tiers... will tick up over time, which is undoubtedly a core
reason for this change,"" Ward said. Given the high cost of developing new games, analysts had
raised concerns that pressure to bundle more content with
subscriptions may eat into profit at Sony's coveted games unit. Sony will seek to preserve new game sales alongside the
subscription service. ""I think this move should improve margins, as more gamers
will be driven to higher-cost subscriptions,"" said Piers
Harding-Rolls, head of games research at Ampere Analysis. ""If content acquisition costs do increase, Sony will need to
balance that with the additional revenue it will be generating
from the PS Plus subscriber base,"" he added. Microsoft is aggressively growing Game Pass, which has 25
million subscribers, by adding new titles on their launch day
while buying studios to expand its offerings. In January, the Redmond, Washington-based firm struck a$68.7 billion deal for ""Call of Duty"" publisher ActivisionBlizzard. Sony, which has built its own in-house studio network,
responded by buying ""Destiny"" publisher Bungie for $3.6 billion,
with many analysts expecting further dealmaking. Microsoft has gained an early lead in subscriptions,
accounting for 60% of the games subscriptions in North America
and Europe, compared with 7% for Sony, according to Ampere
Analysis. Subscriptions make up only 4% of total gaming
spending. ""PlayStation believes it is smarter for them and for
third-party publishers to put older games into the subscription
plan so that new games can maximize their revenue potential
during their launch windows,"" said IDC's Ward. That hesitance means Sony's offering ""won't have the pull of
Microsoft's service,"" added Ampere's Harding-Rolls. Sony's newly announced pricing is seen as competitive. The
premium tier's $120 annual fee compares with $180 for Game Pass
Ultimate. Both offer cloud gaming, with Sony users able to
stream titles to their consoles and PC. Cloud gaming is seen as the future for the industry, because
it doesn't require downloading or installing games on a console
or PC. That is a potential threat to the console business, whose
operators that have acted as industry gatekeepers. An annual subscription to the mid-tier PlayStation Plus
Extra, which lacks this cloud-gaming feature, works out at just
over $8 monthly, compared with $9.99 for the Game Pass. ""Value and pricing of that nature would simply not be
possible if we were to put our new games into the service upon
their release,"" said Sony's Ryan. Microsoft has said that Game Pass subscribers play more
games and spend more on games, too - a view echoed by Sony. ""Everything comes down to engagement,"" Ryan said. ""If you
get people engaged on your platform, monetization typically
follows.""",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/sony-launches-game-pass-counterattack-with-subscription-service-upgrade/article65273197.ece

400%, and charging artificially high premiums for ad placements. They also said senior Facebook executives knew for years
that the company's ""potential reach"" metric was inflated by
duplicate and fake accounts, yet did nothing about it and took
steps to cover it up. After calling out Meta's ""blunderbuss"" objections to class
certification, Donato rejected its contention that the class was
too diverse, including ""large sophisticated corporations"" as
well as individuals and small businesses, and that it would be
too hard to calculate damages. Donato also said it made sense to let individual plaintiffs
sue as a group, given that ""no reasonable person"" would sue Meta
individually to recover at most a $32 price premium. The judge is expected later this year to consider Meta's bid

and pay commissions of 15-30% on digital goods purchases has
come under scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers around the

Amazon and Microsoft are the biggest players
followed by Alphabet's Google, doesn't pose
competition concerns yet because of Europe's Gaia-X initiative,
EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on Monday. (Sign up to our Technology newsletter, Today’s Cache, for insights on emerging themes at the intersection of technology, business and policy. Click here to subscribe for free.) Cloud computing services have seen demand soar, driven in
part by the COVID-19 pandemic. They have become a big driver of growth at the big tech
companies, with AWS generating 13% of Amazon's revenue last year
and 74% of its operating income while Microsoft's IntelligentCloud unit, of which Azure is a big chunk, brought in 37% of its
overall sales. The market power of the big companies has sparked unease at
smaller rivals in recent years, with German software provider
NextCloud, France's OVHcloud and two other companies
filing complaints about Microsoft's cloud practices to Vestager. ""No, so far we've had no concerns,"" Vestager told Reuters in
an interview when asked if she was worried about companies
potentially abusing their dominance. She said Gaia-X, a project to create secure and efficient
cloud data that seeks to reduce the EU bloc's dependence on
Silicon Valley giants, would boost competition. ""This is not something that we are engaged in, but I
basically see it as pro-competitive when you have someone to
show potential customers that there are more than two giants
where you can place your business,"" she said. An industry study last year cited respondents worried about
unfair terms imposed by some software companies to access their
cloud infrastructure, unfair licence terms and bundling of
software products with cloud infrastructure services. Microsoft has said that it makes its software available to
customers across all environments, including those of other
cloud providers.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/eus-vestager-says-no-antitrust-concerns-yet-about-cloud-computing/article65269819.ece

their antitrust lawsuit against Meta Platform's Facebook. (Sign up to our Technology newsletter, Today’s Cache, for insights on emerging themes at the intersection of technology, business and policy. Click here to subscribe for free.) The Chamber, along with the Computer and Communications

because the states had waited too long to file their case. Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the
District of Columbia last July dismissed the states' lawsuit
against Facebook, saying they delayed in challenging the
acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp in 2012 and 2014
respectively. Boasberg, who also dismissed a lawsuit filed by the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission, allowed the agency to refile its
complaint but did not do so for the states. The group, made up of 46 states, Guam and the District of
Columbia, argued that Boasberg erred in ruling they had waited
too long to file the lawsuit and asked an appeals court to
reinstate the case. The business organisations argued further that the states
were wrong in arguing that Facebook broke the law with
exclusionary conduct, in executing what the states called a
""buy-or-bury strategy."" The business groups' brief called this
position ""dubious and dangerous.""",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/us-chamber-sides-with-facebook-in-antitrust-appeal/article65269800.ece

again approved a bill to provide $52 billion in U.S. subsidies
for semiconductor chips manufacturing in a bid to reach a
compromise after months of discussions. (Sign up to our Technology newsletter, Today’s Cache, for insights on emerging themes at the intersection of technology, business and policy. Click here to subscribe for free.) The 68-28 procedural vote sends the legislation back to the
House of Representatives in a cumbersome process to ultimately
launch a formal process known as a ""conference"" where lawmakers
from both chambers will seek agreement on a compromise version. A persistent industry-wide shortage of chips has disrupted
production in the automotive and electronics industries, forcing
some firms to scale back production, and there have been growing
calls to decrease reliance on other countries for
semiconductors. The Senate first passed chips legislation in June that also
authorised $190 billion to strengthen U.S. technology and
research to compete with China, while the House passed its
version in early February. The bills take different approaches to addressing U.S.
competitiveness with China on a wide range of issues, as well on
trade and some climate provisions. Senate Commerce Committee chair Maria Cantwell said the vote
was crucial to ""get us to real negotiations"" White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the Senate vote was
another step ""to strengthen our supply chains, make more in
America, and outcompete China and the rest of the world for
decades to come. We look forward to the House of Representatives
moving quickly to start the formal conference process as well."" A senior House Democratic aide said the chamber is set to
take up the measure and send it back to the Senate as soon as
later this week. The Senate will need to vote again to launch
the conference. A final agreement might not be reached until
summer. Independent Senator Bernie Sanders criticised the $52
billion in subsidies, calling it ""corporate greed"" and said
taxpayers should get warrants or equity from profitable chips
firms in exchange for subsidies. ""The financial gains made by these companies must be shared
with the American people, not just wealthy shareholders,""
Sanders said. U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo noted that two decades
ago, the United States produced nearly 40% of all chips while
today it accounts for only 12% of global production. The Senate
vote moved the United States ""one step closer toward
revitalising American semiconductor manufacturing, securing our
critical supply chains and bringing home good-quality
manufacturing jobs."" On Friday, General Motors said it would halt
production at a pickup truck plant in Indiana for two weeks in
April because of the chips shortage.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/us-senate-approves-52-billion-chips-bill-in-bid-to-reach-compromise/article65269778.ece

(Sign up to our Technology newsletter, Today’s Cache, for insights on emerging themes at the intersection of technology, business and policy. Click here to subscribe for free.) Since March 24, loading new Mir cards into the service has become unavailable. Previously loaded cards will be stopped by Apple over the next few days, the Cupertino-based company informed. Mir is a local payment card in Russia sponsored by the government. The Mir payment system was established by the Central Bank of Russia in 2017. Mir is already accepted at more than 85% of POS terminals in the country, in neighbouring countries and internationally via co-branding deals with card brands, including Amex, JCB and Maestro, according to ppro, a payments company. The demand for Mir payment cards soared three times in March compared with the same period in the previous year, according to a study by Rosbank, a Russian bank. It estimated that the percentage of registration of Mir digital cards increased to 44.5% in March from 13% in January. This comes at a time when International payment systems Visa and Mastercard suspended their work in Russia in early March. A number of Russian and Belarusian banks were disconnected from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) system in the process of imposing sanctions on Russia for invading Ukraine.

895,"March 28, 2022",20:30 IST,sci-tech,technology,Instagram brings options to view posts in chronological order," Instagram has introduced two new options for its users that will allow them to view posts in their feed in chronological order. (Sign up to our Technology newsletter, Today’s Cache, for insights on emerging themes at the intersection of technology, business and policy. Click here to subscribe for free.) The photo and video-sharing platform used to display content in chronological order before 2016, but later introduced a feed that ranked posts using algorithms. The two new options in a way bring back the simplicity of viewing posts that users are most interested in, instead of scrolling through a stream of algorithm-recommended posts in their feed. The Meta-owned company has labelled the two options – Following and Favourites. Users can access the two options by tapping on Instagram in the top left corner of their home page. Following, as the name suggests, would display posts from the people a user follows. And when using Favourites, users would be able to view the most recent posts from the accounts they have added to their favourites list, according to Adam Mosseri, Head of Instagram. The favourites list allows users to add up to 50 accounts, like their best friends, family and favourite creators. According to Mosseri, both Favourites and Following will show users' posts in chronological order, so they can quickly catch up on recent posts. Posts from accounts on users’ favourites list will also show up higher in their home feed, Mosseri added. Interestingly, the home feed for users would still display posts based on their preferences, generated through algorithmic ranking as the two new options for viewing posts in chronological order can’t be set as default.  The lack of a default option isn’t surprising, as Mosseri had said in a blog post that when the platform was offering a chronological order for posts “it became impossible for most people to see everything, let alone all the posts they cared about.” He added, “by 2016, people were missing 70% of all their posts in feed, including almost half of posts from their close connections.” Even though users would be required to manually select an option, the availability of Following and Favourites options would probably make it easier for many users to choose what posts they wish to see in their feed, as opposed to going the algorithmic way of endless scrolling. Those who choose to use one of the two options could also reduce some screentime as they might find what they want to see on the platform much faster. Meta intends to build features like Favourites and Following to give users more choice and control over what they see, according to Mosseri.",Ishan Patra,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/instagram-brings-options-to-view-posts-in-chronological-order/article65268262.ece

(Sign up to our Technology newsletter, Today’s Cache, for insights on emerging themes at the intersection of technology, business and policy. Click here to subscribe for free.) Worldwide AR/VR headset shipments expanded 92.1% to 11.2 million units in 2021, compared to the previous year, with Meta’s Quest 2, capturing 78% share of the combined AR/VR market during the year, according to a report by research firm IDC. “Meta has led the AR/VR industry by offering a very accessibly priced headset and by moving beyond the core gaming audience, piquing the interest of non-gamers as well as businesses,” Jitesh Ubrani, Research Manager at IDC, said in a statement. While Oculus took the top spot in the AR/VR headset market, two Chinese companies DPVR and ByteDance’s Pico also performed well during 2021. DPVR, which has had plenty of success in Asian markets and captured 5.1% share globally, and Pico bagged the third position with 4.5% share of the market. VR pioneer HTC and China-based online video platform iQIYI completed the top five companies. Pico, like DPVR, is well-positioned in Asian markets but has also done well in North America and Western Europe where it has helped fill the void left when Meta discontinued its Oculus Go, IDC noted. “The company [Meta] still lacks major competitors though that will likely change over the course of the next twelve to 18 months when Sony will re-enter the space with the PSVR2, and we continue to expect headsets from the likes of Apple and other smartphone vendors to eventually launch and garner a lot of attention from end-users,” Ubrani said. According to IDC, the headset shipments are projected to grow 46.9% year-over-year in 2022 and experience double-digit growth through 2026 as global shipments of AR/VR headsets surpass 50 million units by the end of the forecast with a 35.1% compounded annual growth rate. The firm further added that the discussion of the Metaverse is driving hype—and investment—around AR, VR, and a host of adjacent technologies, but it doesn’t expect this frothy behaviour to impact headset volumes any time soon. Market leader Facebook, which rebranded itself as Meta, is focusing on bringing the metaverse, an immersive digital realm, to life.

898,"March 28, 2022",17:49 IST,sci-tech,technology,Is Kaspersky a geopolitical pawn?," In 2017, a notorious ransomware outbreak hit several large organisations globally. The attack came on the heels of a big WannaCry attack. Some cybersecurity experts suggested the cyberattack could be a new variant of the WannaCry ransomware or some form of Petya attack. One cybersecurity firm had a different view. In its blog, the following day, it noted that the attack could be the work of a new malware that is different from all earlier known types of Petya.  The cybersecurity firm named the malware ‘NotPetya’, and put it under a separate malicious software family: wiper.  Perpetrators of a wiper attack are interested in deleting all the data from the victim’s computer. That means, any payment made in return for the stolen data is a waste.  A year later, the U.K. decided to name the perpetrator of the NotPetya attack. It accused Russia for launching the malware that specifically targeted organisations in Ukraine and Europe.  “The attack showed a continued disregard for Ukrainian sovereignty. Its reckless release disrupted organisations across Europe costing hundreds of millions of pounds,” Foreign Office Minister for Cyber Security Lord Tariq Ahmad of Wimbledon said in a statement. The blog that led to the accusation was put out by Kaspersky. The Moscow-headquartered anti-virus firm did not name the perpetrator as Russia, but merely put out details of the exploit and NotPetya’s modus operandi. Just a year earlier, the Russia-based firm received a cold reception across the Atlantic. The U.S. government unchecked it from the approved list of vendors used by federal agencies amid concerns the firm’s software could be used by the Kremlin to enter American networks.  The move to delist Kaspersky arose from the suspicion that the organisation could be compelled to assist Moscow to intercept communication transiting Russian networks.  Kaspersky was given an opportunity to present a written argument along with evidence that could assuage concerns of the federal authorities. The company immediately responded, and it was kept active in the U.S. Now, as Russia’s invasion into Ukraine continues, Kaspersky is once again put under the geopolitical spotlight.  Last Friday, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) added Kaspersky Lab to its list of communications equipment and service providers deemed threats to the U.S. national security. This is the first time a Russian firm has been added to the list. The anti-virus software maker said it was “disappointed” with the FCC’s action, and called “a response to the geopolitical climate rather than a comprehensive evaluation of the integrity of Kaspersky’s products and services.” According to several reports, Kaspersky’s products score high in reference test conducted at four top antivirus labs, including AV-Test Institute based in Germany. Also, several experts worldwide agree that company’s antivirus software does an excellent job of protecting computers. And that is why Kaspersky’s situation looks like a what the company said about itself five years ago, that it is “caught in the middle of a geopolitical fight where each side is attempting to use the company as a pawn in their political game.”",John Xavier,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/todays-cache-can-you-trust-kaspersky/article65267528.ece
899,"March 28, 2022",10:30 IST,sci-tech,technology,The role of VRR for a flawless gaming experience," The story so far: Google is said to be testing support for variable refresh rates (VRR) in the Chrome OS 101 Dev Channel, according to a report by About Chromebooks. The feature could improve gaming experience on Chromebooks. Several other device makers have used a form of the VRR in their products to provide superior experience, particularly in gaming. Refresh rate is the number of times a display is capable of refreshing in a second. It is measured in hertz (Hz). So, a 30 Hz or a 60 Hz display can refresh 30 or 60 times per second, respectively. The higher the refresh rate, the better the quality of viewing experience. Displays with over 120 Hz can deliver a smoother and more comfortable viewing experience. This is necessary while playing video games or watching videos. VRR supports a wide range of refresh rates, allowing its refresh rate to change in real-time based on the frames-per-second (FPS) rate coming from a source device such as a gaming console. For example, displays that support refresh rates from 10 Hz to 120 Hz, or 1Hz to 120 Hz, can adjust to different content styles for a seamless entertainment or gaming experience. VRR, which is also termed as dynamic refresh rate or adaptive refresh rate by different device makers, is designed to eliminate syncing issues that arise when the refresh rate of a display does not match with the FPS of the content from a source device. Issues such as screen-tearing, judder (wobbling effect) and lag are common when refresh rate and FPS are not synchronised.  This screen technology enables a monitor or a TV to communicate with a gaming console or a media streaming device much more effectively. Consequently, when the source device sends video frames as fast as it can, the display is able to adapt its own refresh rate continuously and seamlessly within its specific range to match that of the source. VRR is provided by AMD’s FreeSync, Nvidia’s G-Sync, HDMI 2.1, Apple’s ProMotion, and Qualcomm’s Q-Sync to name a few. Among these, AMD and Nvidia’s VRR have been used in PCs for a number of years, and also in PlayStation and Xbox gaming consoles. Yes. It can improve gaming experience in both console and PC-based gaming. Once the console is connected to a monitor that supports one of the VRR solutions, it can eliminate judder and artefacts caused by mismatches in FPS. This in turn significantly improves image quality in games and videos. The higher the FPS the smoother the experience for gamers. The makers of the latest gaming consoles offer a growing number of video games that play at 120 FPS and have optimised many popular older games to play at 120 FPS as well. Using a display that supports VRR technology, players can expect smooth and lag-free visuals in fast-paced games, giving them a greater advantage in first-person shooters, racing, or real-time strategy titles. Besides, the screen technology can give players an important edge, especially in competitive multi-player games where split-second decisions are crucial for victory. Casual gamers will also be able to appreciate extra responsiveness in gameplay. One of the common problems gamers experience is screen-tearing when the FPS output from a source is higher than the refresh rate a display can handle, which results in the display showing two or more frames in its top and bottom halves. This syncing issue can be fixed with one of the VRR solutions. Premium smartphones offer a kind of VRR solution. Samsung first introduced VRR technology in its Galaxy Note 20 Ultra and later in the subsequent iterations of its flagship devices.  The latest Galaxy S22 and S22+ feature adaptive refresh rate from 48 Hz to 120 Hz, whereas the more premium S22 Ultra offers adaptive refresh rate from 1 Hz to 120 Hz. Apple’s ProMotion has an adaptive refresh rate of up to 120 Hz on its new iPad Pro (10.5-inch) and iPad Pro 2nd generation (12.9-inch). Its latest iPhone 13 Pro models also feature an adaptive refresh rate from 10 Hz to 120 Hz. In mobile devices, a VRR solution can not only improve the gaming experience of users by keeping up with intense gameplay but also save battery power on them as the adaptive refresh rate does not run at the highest rate all the time and switches to a lower refresh rate during less graphic-intensive tasks. Earlier this month, Google said that it is working with Valve to bring Steam to Chrome OS. “We are very excited to share that we’ll be landing an early, alpha-quality version of Steam on Chrome OS in the Dev channel for a small set of Chromebooks coming soon,” it noted on a support page. Additionally, the search giant may introduce gaming-focused Chrome OS devices, with at least one of those devices featuring a full RGB keyboard, according to a report by 9to5Google.  Google’s development of new devices for the gaming market, testing of the VRR technology, and collaboration with Valve can be looked at as positive indicators for Chromebooks.",Ishan Patra,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/role-vrr-tech-flawless-game-experience/article65264625.ece

Russia's invasion of Ukraine or recent warnings by President Joe
Biden of potential cyberattacks by Russia in response to U.S.
sanctions and support of Ukraine. Kaspersky said in a statement that it was disappointed in
the FCC decision, arguing it was ""made on political grounds.""

geopolitical climate rather than a comprehensive evaluation of
the integrity of Kaspersky’s products and services,"" the company

operators again without factual basis. The U.S. should
immediately stop its unreasonable suppression of Chinese
companies. ""China will take necessary measures to resolutely safeguard
the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies,"" it

purchase or maintain products from the companies. The fund
supports telecommunications for rural areas, low-income
consumers, and facilities such as schools, libraries and

901,"April 08, 2022",15:16 IST,entertainment,movies,Why you can’t like ‘Friends’ if you like ‘Seinfeld’," It began with a WhatsApp conversation with a friend the other day. We were talking about favourite TV shows, and the friend said she liked Friends, while I, desisting from saying what I usually do when the show is mentioned, simply said Seinfeld was my favourite. (I have many favourites. I thought of Seinfeld because both shows were popular at about the same time, and constantly pitted against each other. When she responded, “OMG, I loveSeinfeld, too,” throwing caution to the winds, I remarked that it was an impossibility. She said, “Why not? Both shows are about close-knit groups of friends, aren’t they?” While at a very basic level that could be a similarity, you can’t in any real sense like both Seinfeld and Friends, I posited (although I rarely posit, presuppose or predicate), presenting what I thought were strong pieces of evidence for why the twain would never meet. She responded with some evocative emojis. The discussion came to a civilised end. Why did I find what my friend said so wrong? After all, that both shows are about a group of friends who spend all their time with each other is a pretty accurate summation, isn’t it? Because, while being an ‘accurate’ definition, it’s a woefully inadequate one. While both shows are indeed paeans to old friendships and camaraderie — brought on more by exclusion than inclusion — Friends valorises, glamorises, idealises and romanticises togetherness, whereas Seinfeld unapologetically celebrates what such a brand of togetherness really is: utter selfishness. Rachel, Ross, Monica, Chandler, Phoebe and Joey (arguably the most recognisable fictional names in TV history), in the vein of the Seven Dwarfs, could just as easily have been named Frivolous, Nerdy, Tight-ass, Snarky, Flaky and Thick, respectively, for that was how identifiably their makers branded them. But it wouldn’t require close examination to figure that despite their supposedly diverse ‘USPs’, they were all just the same person: loyal, reliable, giving, and selfless when the situation demands. And good-looking. They saw themselves that way, too, with no irony whatsoever. A diligent mix of these noble qualities, the show tells us, is the glue that holds them together. Plus their good looks, of course. They could each be with anyone they wanted; they chose to be with each other. Jerry, Kramer, Elaine, and dear abominable George, on the other hand, are together — and stick together — because they are aware of each other’s and their own deep-rooted self-centredness. If they were to be named after their chief characteristics, they would be Subtly Selfish, Eccentrically Selfish, Timidly Selfish and Unabashedly Selfish. They don’t pretend to be anything else, and the writers don’t see them as anything but. The glue that holds this bunch together is convenience. Jerry, for a ‘persnickety’ guy, is a pretty tolerant one who allows his friends to traipse in and out of his apartment at will. And that becomes the meeting point for a bunch of misfits who have merely gravitated towards each other. Their togetherness hasn’t required much effort, nor has there been much choosing involved. But the most important factor of their inextricability is that no one else can tolerate them above a day. If Friends is an American version of a Sooraj Barjatya film disguised in ’90s New York attire pretending to be a comedy, Seinfeld is noir in the garb of a sitcom, with nary a character possessing a single redeeming feature. Friends ends with the clique (mostly) unsingle, happily domesticated, turning back with one last tearful look at their favourite hangout, Central Perk. Their special, exclusive, six-member-only bond — and their good looks — have ensured them a happy ending. In that last scene, we know they will go their separate ways… but will always stay in touch. And — as the title song goes — will be there for each other through childbirths, sicknesses, graduations of offspring and, heaven forbid, divorces, too. Till the end of time. And if we are lucky, they will reunite (for astronomical fees) in Friends: The Movie or Friends 2.0 and allow the fawning public to bask in nostalgia. Seinfeld ends with the four friends in jail, put there by all the people they have excluded, victimised and walked over, finally incarcerated for the worst crime of all, one they have been getting away with for nine seasons: their irredeemable selfishness. We can see they have no future. They will serve their terms, and chances are they’ll reunite at a seniors’ facility in Florida, Del Boca Vista perhaps, still single, to spend their twilight years in joint, anonymous, selfish misery. Because no one else can or will have them. The ending is a refreshingly unsentimental antithesis to all long-running TV shows which say goodbye with self-conscious, self-referencing last looks at the now iconic set where it all happened as if to say, ‘look, how great we were, this is where we made history’ before tearfully closing the door for the last time. To say the two shows are similar because they are comedies about cliques is like saying No Time to Die and Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery are both films about British secret agents who aren’t conventionally good-looking. To be able to like both Friends and Seinfeld is to admit you haven’t watched either anything but superficially. That Friends has takers by the million in India, and is constantly trending here, is no surprise. That the takers belong as much to my generation as their offspring is no surprise either. It appeals to the Indian idea — young and old — of family/ friendship. It features good-looking people who are ‘cool’ and ‘modern’ as suggested by their choice of attire and lingo, but who are ‘warm’ and ‘traditional’ when it comes to values like loyalty and reliability. Despite their jumping into bed with each other, they are squeaky clean. Despite the periodic appearance of Rachel’s nipples through her tight tees, they are conservative. Friends is how Indians see themselves. A blend of modern and traditional (and good-looking). Whereas Seinfeld is who we really are, without the wit or self-awareness — anarchic, inelegant, and pathologically self-obsessed. Remember the Seinfeld episode where George’s fiancée Susan dies? She ingests a deadly toxin while licking the dodgy glue on the envelopes of their wedding invites; skinflint George has bought the cheapest stationery. Jerry, Elaine and Kramer rush to the hospital to be by their friend’s side. They are sympathetic. For a minute. Soon, they mumble an excuse and fade away, leaving an abject George to take care of things. And Seinfeld fans will tell you that George, too, would have done exactly the same in reverse. Can you imagine such a situation in Friends? Would the tragic death of a principal character’s fiancé be handled with such utter irreverence? In another Seinfeld episode, while standing in line at a theatre, Elaine learns that her boyfriend has met with an accident and is in hospital fighting for his life. Does she rush off to be by his side? Not exactly. She completes the task at hand (getting herself a box of Jujyfruit) and then ambles across. That is so us. Come what may, Indians will look out for Number One: themselves. Whether flood, famine, pandemic, or alien invasion, we must perform that puja, attend that wedding, or waddle off fatly on that vacation. Why? Because it was on our agenda, dammit. Yet it is Friends we love. In our heads, we are the Sassy Sextet: caring, witty, loyal and good-looking. Not like the selfish and somewhat scruffy Seinfeld lot. When Friends came out, I watched it like everybody else. And I liked it. But I didn’t adopt it for life like all of India has been doing. (Or like I did with Seinfeld.) I didn’t know why then. I do now. Sentiment. I find sentiment to be comedy’s worst enemy. Or, for that matter, of all art. What would Chaplin be without his sentiment, you might ask. Good point. But there’s a principal difference between Chaplin sentimentality and the Friends variety . It’s who the sentiment is reserved for. Chaplin was a champion of the downtrodden. He was them, a tramp. His sentimentality seemed like it was for himself, but he was speaking for an entire social class. In Friends, they are sentimental about themselves. And given their looks, health, money and privilege, this is not just off-putting, it’s offensive. We can see why the show is so popular in India. It appeals to privileged, self-obsessed, English-speaking urban Indians who go to good schools funded by Daddy & Mummy, marry similarly entitled folk, and go off in cool clothes to sip wine on foreign vacays. Just look at the pictures on social media. Go to a café or beach resort. See the fuss the privileged make about themselves. I am yet to go to a wedding in recent times where the couple doesn’t think they are starring in a romcom biopic, and we are all cheering extras called in to fill up the background of their big-budget spectacle. While Chaplin’s art is forgiven for being maudlin because it comforted the disturbed, Friends commits the unforgivable sin of comforting the entitled. But Seinfeld, like the best satire, does it best. It embraces the fact that everyone is shallow. When we like Seinfeld, we accept that we, too, are profoundly shallow. And when we do that, well, we have to dislike Friends. A friend’s friend asked me recently, smiling knowingly, “So, in this group of yours, you are more Chandler than Joey, right?” “Wrong,” I said. “I’m Gunther.” “C’mon,” he said. “Actually, I’m Newman,” I said. “Who’s that?” he asked.

Titled ""1770-Ek Sangram"", author-turned-filmmaker Ram Kamal Mukherjee and former head of Zee Studio Sujoyy Kuttyiy announced the project on Friday, which marks the 128th death anniversary of the novelist. The film also marks the 150th year of 'Vande Matram', the song that Chatterjee had composed for his novel ""Anandamath"" which was published in Bangadarshan Magazine in 1872. The film will be produced by Shhailendra Kkumar from SS1 Entertainment, Suraj Sharma from P K Entertainments and will be made in Hindi, Tamil and Telugu. ""When Sujoyy approached me for 'Anandamath', I was a bit taken aback. I had read the novel many years ago, and frankly speaking, I didn't feel that today's generation would be able to connect with the subject. ""But when I met Ram Kamal and he shared his vision on 'Anandamath', he had a completely different take on the novel. It was commercial and connected with human emotions.

909,"April 08, 2022",10:30 IST,entertainment,movies,Why ‘CODA’ represents a watershed moment in Hollywood," Despite all the controversy surrounding the recently concluded 94th Academy Awards, the focus will hopefully be on the win that mattered the most: CODA becoming the first film featuring predominantly deaf actors in leading roles and receiving the Oscar for Best Picture. By winning the Supporting Actor (Troy Kotsur) award as well as Adapted Screenplay (Sian Heder), the Sundance indie project created history as the first film distributed by a streaming service — Apple TV+ — to win the Best Picture award. Incidentally, the only deaf performer to win an acting Oscar before Kotsur was his CODA co-star Marlee Matlin, 35 years ago, for her role in Children of a Lesser God, about a deaf woman's romantic relationship with a speech teacher. Much has been written about CODA’s feel-good charm, the fantastic supporting cast and director Sian Heder’s immersive narrative, that of Ruby, the only hearing person in her deaf family, facing a crisis of conscience when she is torn between pursuing her love of music and the fear of abandoning her parents, when their fishing business is threatened. But what does the win mean for the overall deaf community? Will it open doors for more disability representation in Hollywood films? Can we see more disabled talent — directors, writers, actors and technicians — to tell their stories? A look at recent history is encouraging. Todd Haynes' Wonderstruck (2017), John Krasinski's A Quiet Place (2018) and its sequel, Darius Marder's Sound of Metal (2019) and Chloé Zhao’s Marvel flick Eternals (2021) all featured deaf characters who were integral to the storyline. More importantly, they were not relegated to the sidelines or framed to be two-dimensional victims introduced just to garner the sympathy of the audience. It has also made A-list Hollywood stars out of deaf actors such as Lauren Ridloff and Millicent Simmonds. Ridloff was already known for her recurring role in the popular television show The Walking Dead, before landing the coveted role of a deaf superhero Makkari in Eternals, who possesses the ability of superspeed. Millicent, who is just 19 years old now, broke out in the mystery-drama Wonderstruck, after which global fame came calling with The Quiet Place franchise; without giving too much away, her character’s cochlear implant in the film becomes the solution to saving mankind against the aliens.  In both examples, the characters’/ actors’ deafness is used to empower them — as opposed to being used as a tool to incite pity — and have been lauded for showcasing disability representation in a positive manner. Similarly, in Sound of Metal, we see a wonderfully constructed world environment for the deaf, following a metal drummer who loses his hearing, and is struggling to accept that his deafness is not a handicap. Though the project did face flak for casting two hearing actors — Riz Ahmed and Paul Rac, who is a CODA (child of deaf adults) — the deaf community mostly embraced the project for shedding a rare light on their societal norms. Problems will always continue to exist; major studios and networks will still ponder the business aspects of movies or television shows headlined by hearing-impaired performers, many films still don’t subtitle dialogues when they release locally and overseas in theatres, while captioned screenings (a format that includes text description of significant sound effects as well as dialogues) are even more rare. Yet,  CODA’s success on the awards circuit — along with Kotsur’s goosebumps-inducing speech at the Oscars — cannot be understated, as it has now encouraged streaming services globally to take a bet on the most unlikely of contenders.  One hopes that just like watershed moments in Hollywood emerged for Black and queer representation in the last decade, CODA and similar projects that come in its wake will do the same for disability representation, and influence the hearing person’s perception of deafness and the deaf community. After all, all representation matters.",Gautam Sunder,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/why-coda-represents-a-watershed-moment-in-hollywood/article65299414.ece
910,"April 07, 2022",17:36 IST,entertainment,movies,"7 Oscars and counting: Namit Malhotra, CEO of VFX firm DNEG on what goes into creating magic on screen"," Before this year’s Academy Awards, the British VFX firm DNEG had already notched up six Oscars for their special effects work on films like Interstellar, Inception and Blade Runner 2049. They have now added a seventh Oscar with their brilliant work on Denis Villeneuve’s Dune. The film, based on the eponymous science fiction novel by Frank Herbert, has been widely praised for its distinctive visual style — and the special effects were an integral part of that.  In a Zoom interview, Namit Malhotra, chairman and CEO of DNEG, shares some insights about the process of putting together an average big-studio Hollywood movie’s special effects; and the many ways in which visual effects techniques are changing the way filmmakers think about their craft.  “It’s a very detailed process,” Malhotra says, “and it can take 6-18 months, depending upon the type of project. And it goes back to the very first process of filmmaking, which is scriptwriting. The script becomes the foundation for designing or creating the world you finally see in the film, so there’s a lot of art there. A concept artist sits down with the director and makes their rendition, which we work off — obviously, for the people designing the visual effects, those images can be much more useful than words describing the same thing.” In the “pre-visualisation” step of the process, as Malhotra describes, a rough animated sequence of the final scene is created. All the other department heads, including, and especially, the director, can see this pre-visualisation and offer their inputs. Once this sequence is locked, the process of producing the visual effects can begin — that’s where the ‘visual effects supervisor’ starts working with the director on-set. Whether it’s practical effects or digital effects, the supervisor works closely with the director to get the sequence just right. Which is why at the Oscars, it came as a surprise to many when Villenueve was not nominated in the Best Director category, despite Dune being nominated in every single technical category.  There are also more specific kinds of problem-solving involved when it comes to visual effects. “There are specialists for every aspect,” Malhotra says. “Let’s say you are shooting a big car chase sequence. So there will be someone to design the look of the car, somebody else will figure out the precise physics of a heavy car tumbling off a cliff — their job is to make it look as authentic and scientifically accurate as possible.”   When you talk about special effects to the average film viewer — there’s a widespread misconception that everybody everywhere relies heavily on ‘green screens’ when it comes to visual effects, that is actors pretending that the green screen is actually the eventual digital background. The assumption is that all of this is remote and fixed in post-production, that the visual effects team is thus at a distance from the on-ground shoot location.  This is simply not true anymore, especially over the past 7-8 years. Malhotra says. “If you look at Interstellar, one of the movies we won an Oscar for, you’ll see that it was one of the first movies to do away with the green screen, to a large extent. We had these big, high-quality digital projectors that were projecting different kinds of backdrops. In the scene where the main characters are flying through the ‘wormhole’, they’re actually looking at the world outside and you can see the wonder and amazement on their faces.”  As Malhotra explains, DNEG had put together the digital backdrops before that scene was shot, which allowed director Christopher Nolan to put together a ‘hybrid shot’ of sorts. Something similar was also used by DNEG for the space exploration movie First Man, which also won an Oscar. More recently, Disney shows like The Mandalorian have used a variation of this to great effect. What these techniques allow the director to do is simple — it gives them leeway to use more natural surroundings and landscapes. You can see this ‘hybridity’ in action in all of the rooftop sequences in the recently released The Batman, for instance.  DNEG recently worked on S.S. Rajamouli’s RRR and in the years ahead, will work on some other Indian movies as well, including Ayan Mukerji’s much-hyped superhero film Brahmastra, starring Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt and Amitabh Bachchan. According to Malhotra, there have been certain fundamental changes in the way Indian filmmakers use special effects. “Earlier, special effects were used almost always as a ‘quick fix’,” he says. “If the director (and this was true with directors in Hollywood and elsewhere as well) was not happy with the way a shot turned out, or if they thought a particular scene was very difficult to shoot practically, they would shoot an approximation and then ask the visual effects department to fix it in post-production. Now, people are writing scripts with certain kinds of special effects in mind. It’s no longer a quick fix or an afterthought. It’s an integral part of the storytelling and the approach is much more coordinated.” Everybody has that one film which they saw in their youth, which completely changed their conception of what was achievable onscreen in terms of visuals. For me (and for many other millennials) that film was James Cameron’s Avatar (2009). Malhotra told us how that ‘it’ moment happened for him. “I always wanted to be a director, you know,” Malhotra explained. “The film that I would say changed my mind was Jurassic Park (1993). I was just amazed when I saw the film. Forget ‘how did they do it?’, I was thinking ‘how did they even think about this?’ The fact that they could think about creating this world where there are dinosaurs roaming around… it creates such a strong connection, a feeling of intrigue among the audience. I remember, as a kid, going back to the theatre and watching it a second time just to try and understand how they could have possibly put it together.”  After Jurassic Park, Forrest Gump (1994) became the next film which the young Malhotra was deeply impressed by. Not only do the film’s war sequences involve impressive special effects, there are several scenes where the protagonist is ‘inserted’ in actual historical footage, typically pivotal moments in American history (like a famous scene where Gump meets President John F. Kennedy). “I came from a very Bollywood background,” Malhotra says. “Before the multiplex era began, there were few halls in Mumbai where you could expect to see films like Forrest Gump or Jurassic Park. But both of these films got me very excited about visual effects and how they could be used in very different ways — as the means to create a ‘wow’ moment or a spectacle, or as the means to a kind of integrated storytelling.” Going by RRR, DNEG’s style and technique work pretty well with Indian films as well (and RRR is every bit a masala film, it has to be said). In the years ahead, we can expect to see the best filmmakers in the world (including Indian ones) knocking on Malhotra’s door.  The writer is working on his first book of non-fiction.",Aditya Mani Jha,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/7-oscars-and-counting-namit-malhotra-ceo-of-vfx-firm-dneg-on-what-goes-into-creating-magic-on-screen/article65289526.ece
911,"April 07, 2022",17:31 IST,entertainment,movies,What makes a song memorable?," For as long as he was alive, my father loved A.R. Rahman’s music the most. He would always talk of how even the peppiest Rahman songs (a Kuthupaattu like ‘Pettairap’) have a solid melody base and easy rhythm. My dad would insist on buying Rahman albums the day they released and I would have to play all the songs to him, so that he could try and catch the raga of each and prove his theory that a good film song is one which has its foundation in melody. He was the one who told me that Kiravani and Sivaranjani were Ilaiyaraaja’s favourite ragas, his ‘research’ based on Vividh Bharati and ‘Ungal Viruppam’ on All India Radio. The longevity of a song depends entirely on its musical merit, which is also why we listen to some songs even years after their release. Sometimes, the dance moves or visual montages are brilliant, and just the humming of a tune or a sudden image triggers a memory of the first time we heard the song or watched it on screen. The current Anirudh super-hit ‘Jolly lo gymkhana’ from Beast harks back to a 1956 song of the same name — a song which was perhaps the first in a long line of Kuthupaattus that slowly evolved, finally attaining cult status in the 80s after the roaring hit ‘Machaana paatheengala’ from Ilaiyaraaja’s debut film Annakkili, which was rustic in beat and lyrics yet melodious in tune. The 1956 ‘Jolly lo gymkhana’ is from the Sivaji Ganesan-Savitri-Padmini film Amara Deepam. Padmini, by then gaining popularity for her dance moves, plays a gypsy girl in the film and we see her in this film singing and dancing to this energetic number, whose first few words are as light-hearted as in the Beast song sung by Vijay. Songs which are ‘light’ in lyrics, tune and beat always enjoy unmatched popularity. In the black and white movies, a ‘jolly song’ was one where the dancing was ‘freestyle choreography’ and as the 80s dawned, a Kuthupaattu was accompanied by ‘street dancing’ moves (Kamalhaasan did it to perfection in ‘Singaarisarakku nalla sarakku’ from Khaaki Sattai). In the 90s, such songs had lyrics that sounded like Gaana (the Tamil equivalent to rap). Kuthupaattus by now referred to songs that one could dance to in a style made popular in the North Madras milieu. Many college cultural events would always have a guest performance from such groups, much like the rap groups that emerged from Mumbai’s Dharavi. They were characterised by fast movements, staccato style and flexible grace. The music was often their own (they would play them on the tape recorders they carried), a rough mix of a Michael Jackson beat with Ilaiyaraaja’s violin pieces (mostly from his background scores). In the millennium, this gave way to Rahman’s notes and popular international rhythms. Songs in Indian cinema are prominently a tool to take the story forward or convey an emotion. Composers like M.S. Viswanathan and Ilaiyaraaja were stars in their own rights. It is said that in the 80s, a producer had to book Ilaiyaraaja’s dates first and then assemble a film around his album. The film would make money before its release from audio sales alone. There were heroes whose careers got a fillip only because of Ilaiyaraaja’s music (Mohan, Ramarajan and Vijayakanth’s initial films). Equally, there are film directors who made a difference to Ilaiyaraaja’s music, and for whom the composer reserved his best, such as Bharathiraja, Mahendran, Balu Mahendra, K. Balachander and Maniratnam. The song ‘Rakkamma kaiyya thattu’ from Thalapathy is a great example of how good music and good visuals can make for a great song. The music director is seen as the third most important name, after the hero and director, who adds to a film’s profits. However, gone are the days when films were made around the concept of “Let’s get six songs from the music director and weave a story around it”. Anirudh’s recent chartbusters have had both the soft and slow ‘Naan pizhai nee mazhalai’ from Vignesh Shivan’s Kaathuvaakkula Rendu Kaadhal and the robust ‘Arabic Kuthu’ from Nelson’s Beast and both crossed 25 million and 220 million views in record time ahead of the film’s release. A lot comes together for the success of a song. Creating a space for music and composing notes where none existed earlier, then visualising the tune and lyrics, and finally making it all come alive for the screen is the hallmark of Indian cinema.  Today, this visualisation can either be a montage or a choreographed piece. Either way, the song stays in our heads because of the melody quotient and the visual memory it forms. A good example is ‘Rowdy Baby’ from Maari2. As much as melody is important, it cannot be denied that very often the songs that are loved universally and live on across eras are the ones that also add to the story and have a filmmaker’s strong vision behind them. The writer is a content producer, writer, artiste and curator.",Sujatha Narayanan,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/what-makes-a-song-memorable/article65299290.ece

This is the filmmaker's third consecutive blockbuster after ""Baahubali: The Beginning"" and its sequel, ""Baahubali: The Conclusion"". During a special event to celebrate the film's success on Wednesday, Jr NTR said fans' demand for a sequel is fair. ""I'm pretty sure that if he doesn't make (a sequel), you're going to kill him for sure. He needs to make 'RRR 2', there needs to be a conclusion to this also! I was speaking to a journalist and I don't know how but I said 'RRR' franchise. So, hopefully it becomes true. He should make 'RRR 2,'"" the actor told reporters. Charan said that for now he feels content, and is glad that the film could release after a series of delays due to the coronavirus pandemic. ""Of course, we all will be delighted again if Rajamouli sir thinks of 'RRR 2',"" he added. Rajamouli said both his leading stars got out of the ""RRR"" headspace pretty quickly, while he is still trying to ""cool off from the heat which the movie generated"". ""Let it cool down. Of course, for me it would be a great pleasure, not because of what it'll do at the box office, but because I will have more time to spend with my brothers. That'll be more exciting for me. But let time unravel what we have,"" the filmmaker added. The success press event was organised by Jayantilal Gada of Pen Studios, which acquired the north India theatrical rights and all languages digital and satellite rights for ""RRR"". It was also attended by superstar Aamir Khan, filmmaker Karan Johar and veteran lyricist-screenwriter Javed Akhtar. Produced by D V V Entertainment, the film released on March 25 in Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada, and Hindi. ""RRR"" is a fictional tale of two Indian freedom fighters from the early 20th century - Alluri Sitarama (Charan) and Kumaram Bheem, played by Jr NTR. Rajamouli said there is a lot of appreciation from the audience for ""RRR"" but what has been ""significantly different"" was the number of western audiences liking the film. ""This is the kind of thing I note, that these many people are liking my film, so next time when I make a film, I should keep this in mind. I shouldn't let it bother me, weigh me down but think that there is a wider audience listening to your story. Not the numbers, but the love and appreciation from different audiences matters,"" the director added. The film's Hindi version alone has reportedly collected close to Rs 200 cr at the box office. Many trade critics have applauded the team of the film for reviving the post-pandemic box office in a major way. Rajamouli said when the film was getting postponed multiple times, the team was ""unsure about the occupancy of theatres"". ""From the audience's side, I never had a doubt, I always believed that once the film is out, they will come to the theatres. But from the health department side, we didn't know what was coming when. Those were anxious moments for all the films. Once the theatres opened, 'RRR' brought the audiences back to the theatres, that's the biggest achievement for me,"" Rajamouli said.

915,"April 07, 2022",14:01 IST,entertainment,movies,I approached Kumaran Asan through the eyes of director KP Kumaran: Sreevalsan J Menon," In connection with Mahakavi Kumaran Asan’s 150th birth anniversary, Gramavrikshathile Kuyil, a film on the poet, reaches cinemas on April 8. Directed by auteur KP Kumaran, the film stars senior Carnatic vocalist Sreevalsan J Menon as Asan. This is the first film to be made on the popular renaissance poet of Malayalam., a disciple of Sree Narayana Guru, and also a philosopher, social reformer and entrepreneur. Born in 1873 at Kaayikkaram, in erstwhile Travancore, Asan’s life was closely intertwined with the struggle for an egalitarian society in Kerala, where caste did not determine a person’s life.    At a time when artistes are being discriminated on the basis of caste and religion, it is pertinent that a film on a progressive thinker like Asan is being released.  “When Kumaran sir suggested that I act as Asan, I was taken back, considering that I have never acted before in a film,” recalls Sreevalsan. Although a little reluctant to take up the role, the director made it clear to Sreevalsan that the film would not be made if he declined to do it as it demanded someone who would be able to act, sing and render Asan’s immortal verses.   “Then, I had to rethink my decision. I trusted his vision and entrusted myself to his direction. I approached Kumaran Asan through the eyes of Kumaran sir, a repository on Asan, his works and philosophy,” says Sreevalsan, who has also composed the music for the film. To prepare for the role, Sreevalsan was also given a two-volume compilation of Asan’s works by the director.   The film is set during the last six years of the poet, after he had to quit the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam (SNDP), of which he was the secretary for 15 years. By then, much of his great works had already been written.  “We touch upon different aspects of Asan’s life through his poetry and his work. The film focusses on the inner turmoil of a man who was a trailblazer. Asan was a nominated member of the Sree Moolam Praja Sabha, the first legislative assembly in Travancore.  We have recreated portions of his speech wherein he spoke about the need for representation of youth from ‘backward communities’ in government jobs,” says Sreevalsan.  The speech was shot in VJT Hall in Thiruvananthapuram, which was then the Legislative Assembly building.  “What an artiste goes through is similar, irrespective of whether you are a musician, filmmaker or writer. The feelings overlap and I could relate to it. The discrimination, injustice, bouquets and brickbats, the awards…It was all similar to what every artiste goes through even today,” adds the vocalist.  The title of the film is from a poem by Asan. Select verses from his famous poems such as ‘ Chinthavishtayaya Sita’, ‘ Duravastha’, ‘Chandala Bhikshuki’ and ‘ Karuna’ and snippets from other poems have been rendered by Sreevalsan.  Mainly shot in Perumbalam, Aluva and Kalady, the camera has been cranked by KG Jayan and Santhosh Raman. KP Kumaran’s wife M Santhamma Pillai is the producer of the film.   In the meantime, Sreevalsan, who plans to turn director in a couple of months, says his work with the auteur enabled him to get closer to his vision of being a director. “I was able to understand cinema’s aesthetics, and to take a close look at the different approaches of directors and how they treat a narrative. It was a learning experience to work with him. Kumaran sir is not only a knowledgeable person  but also an affectionate person. I cherish the chance I got to work with him,” observes Sreevalsan ",Saraswathy Nagarajan,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/gramavrikshathile-kuyil-a-film-on-kumaran-asan-directed-by-kp-kumaran-with-sreevalsan-j-menon-in-the-lead-releases-on-april-8/article65295301.ece
916,"April 07, 2022",12:26 IST,entertainment,movies,Varun Tej: I do not enjoy watching romances," Actor Varun Tej has waited four years to bring the Telugu sports drama Ghani to the audiences. As the film inches towards theatrical release on April 8, he has been recouping from a bout of viral infection. An IV cannula is attached to his left wrist and his voice appears strained, but he is game for this interview at the production house’s office in Hyderabad: “When we began working on the story of Ghani four-and-a-half years ago, it was pretty much open ground. We had no idea about the other boxing films, Sarpatta Parambarai or Toofan.” Varun had known Kiran Korrapati who was in the direction team of his earlier films. They had once talked about how uncommon it is to find south Indian boxers winning at the national level and wondered if it had to do with the lack of training facilities or encouragement. The discussion also veered into the idea of sportsmanship and the sport, more than a sportsperson, emerging the winner. “These points are the undercurrent of Ghani’s story.” Until then, Varun had been part of romances, a comedy, a period drama, space thriller and a gangster drama. Sports drama was new terrain. Ghani came on the heels of Gaddalakonda Ganesh, the Telugu remake of Jigarthanda in which he reprised Bobby Simha’s part. For that film, director Harish Shankar had urged him to put on weight to look older and rugged. “I did not stop with a few kilograms,” laughs Varun, “Since Ghani was still in pre-production stages, I continued to eat well.” The physical transformation happened with the help of Rakesh Udiyar, fitness trainer to actor and cousin, Ram Charan. Varun also learnt boxing in the US. “I had always wanted to go on a solo trip to the US and took this as an opportunity.” He scouted boxing clubs in Los Angeles and met Tony Jeffries (bronze medal winner in 2008 Summer Olympics). For 45 days, Tony trained Varun in the basics, watching his stance and footwork. Varun then trained with Neeraj Goyat (the first Indian boxer who made it to WBC World Rankings) and a member of Neeraj’s team, Bhupender, in India. The training helped Varun learn the sport, knock off the excess pounds and understand the psyche of a boxer. “I did not have to overthink getting into the head of a boxer, it happened automatically with the physical transformation. Along the line, during script-reading sessions, I unknowingly got hooked.” Varun adds that the film is partly a coming-of-age story of a college-goer working towards realising his dream. The larger reference points for the boxing drama were the Rocky series and Million Dollar Baby. However, Varun asserts that Ghani is not a serious sports film.  There is, of course, the drama that comes with tackling power play and competition. “There is a line in the film where I emphasise that irrespective of whether I win or lose, the sport will win. My character talks less and prefers to let his work speak, much like me in real life.” The pandemic posed challenges. With no clarity on when the situation will be conducive to shoot the film, the fitness regime and training sessions went through changes. “It is impossible to sport six pack abs for a long time. I think I managed it for about eight days. This is the first time I was put through a rigorous routine for fitness and diet. In between my sister (Niharika Konidela) got married, so it was not easy.” Since his debut in Mukunda, Varun had mostly chosen films that are not formulaic mainstream projects. The lukewarm reception at the box office to the space thriller Antariksham 9000 kmph he says, made him rethink his strategy and opt for a middle ground between unconventional ideas and stories that are likely to appeal to a wider audience. During the lockdowns, he watched international content and was aware that the Telugu film audiences were doing the same. “We do not know if our audiences will accept very new or unconventional ideas. In a recent interview, director Rajamouli said however different a story might be, the emotions have to connect with a wide audience. I agree with that thought.” Varun will next be seen in the Anil Ravipudi-directed comedy F3 co-starring Venkatesh, and will begin working on an action entertainer directed by Praveen Sattaru. Varun reveals that he always wanted to do action films, but it took this long to find a good script.  Though his romance dramas Tholi Prema and Fidaa turned out to be super hits, Varun says he does not enjoy romances. “I am grateful for being offered Tholi Prema and Fidaa. The success of those films also made me confident of my script selection, but I don’t enjoy watching romances.” Tell him that this is reminiscent of Shah Rukh Khan who has often stated that he did not enjoy romances, though he was a part of blockbuster romances in the 1990s and 2000s, and Varun says with a laugh, “I never knew that; I am a big fan of SRK.”",Sangeetha Devi Dundoo,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/varun-tej-i-do-not-enjoy-watching-romances/article65296082.ece
917,"April 07, 2022",11:15 IST,entertainment,movies,Indie filmmaker Sainath Ponna’s ‘Geometry Box’ to stream online," During the first lockdown in 2020, when OTT platforms were a major source of entertainment, aspiring filmmaker Sainath Ponna was eager to narrate a story. It seemed like the best time to tap into the burgeoning digital entertainment space.  Having returned to India after completing a filmmaking course at the EICAR International Film School, Paris, he began working on his first Telugu feature film Geometry Box, unaware that he would be swimming against the tide. He completed the indie film in October 2021 and took it to OTT platforms, only to realise that digital players favoured films and series with known names in the cast or crew. “The idea was to make an independent film and narrate a story to the best of our capacity. As long as the story reaches the audiences, the platform does not matter,” says Sainath. As a result, Geometry Box will stream from April 14 on geometrybox.in and on Vimeo on the pay-and-watch model. The initial portions that trace the loneliness of an elderly couple in a village are faintly reminiscent of Telugu films Shatamanam Bhavati and Midhunam. But soon, the story takes a turn when the elders embark on a road trip, stopping at each of the homes of their three children.  An oft-used trope in cinema is about children neglecting parents. Sainath shows the larger picture that can make parents do some soul searching as well and evaluate the impact their decisions have had on their children’s lives. “It is not that the children do not care for their parents; they are caught up with the mess in their own lives.” The younger son makes the father understand the importance of dignity of labour while the daughter shakes up conventional notions of putting up with a bad marriage to conform to societal expectations. The eldest son, whom the parents have showered everything with, makes them face ugly truths.  Some of the crucial confrontations happen in darker settings, as though mirroring the gloomy mood of the parents. The film ends after daybreak when the sunshine brings with it clarity and hope: “It was a conscious decision to have the characters discuss issues in the evening and night; I think people confront the truth better when they are not distracted by other tasks during the day,” Sainath reasons. The elders in the story also do not use mobile or landline phones, and this comes in handy to weave in situations of emotional drama. Geometry Box was filmed in the Nalgonda region of Telangana in sync sound. Prior to filming, Sainath and the crew had extensive online discussions to do the storyboarding and plan the shot divisions. Initially Sainath considered having non-actors for the film but considering the practical difficulties of training them, chose actors who had theatre or film experience. Viplav who plays Venu, a trusted hand for the elderly couple, and Giribabu Devulapalli as the younger son, Krishna, were among the first to be chosen. Mula Virat Ashok Reddy and Rukmini play the elderly couple.  Some of the crew including cinematographer Akshay Ingle, sound designer Sudarshan Sawant and production designer Uttam Mondal, are graduates of the Film and Television Institute of India in Pune. Karthick Iyer came on board as the music composer. Sainath was an MBA with a banking sector job who later moved to filmmaking. He recalls his growing boredom with a corporate job. Watching Imtiaz Ali’s Tamasha, where the protagonist played by Ranbir Kapoor, eventually lets the artistic streak win over his mundane routine, proved to be a turning point: “I felt as though the film and the character spoke directly to me.” Sainath decided to learn filmmaking. His family worried that he was making a mistake in trading a stable career for cinema, but he was determined: “I like French nouveau films and wanted to study in Paris. The experience helped. We planned the film to the smallest detail and there were days when we filmed 60 shots.” Earlier, he made a musical documentary film Kiss My Brass in French and English.",Sangeetha Devi Dundoo,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/indie-filmmaker-sainath-ponnas-geometry-box-to-stream-online/article65292662.ece
918,"April 06, 2022",19:29 IST,entertainment,movies,Janus Metz on ‘All the Old Knives’: ‘A love story and a whodunit’," All the Old Knives is a beautiful, tense thriller where former lovers and spies (Chris Pine and Thandiwe Newton) discuss a disastrous hijacking over a meal. The movie, which also stars Laurence Fishburne, and Jonathan Pryce, is based on a script by Olen Steinhauer from his eponymous novel.  Director Janus Metz says he loved the idea of a spy story set over the course of a dinner. “It was almost like a chamber play,” the Danish director says over a video call from Los Angeles. “I liked Olin’s tone. For me to take ownership as a director, I have to bring my heart and soul into my storytelling. It has to connect and be real. There was coherence between Olin’s sensibility and my understanding of people’s motivations, longings and desires. The idea of this dinner that works as an interrogation between these two star-crossed lovers was compelling.”  The 48-year-old director describes the film as a love story and a whodunit. “On a character level, it is a love story and on a plot level it is a whodunit.” Chris Pine was the first person Metz spoke to about the film. “He loved the project. Chris is so perfect at being charismatic, compelling, generous, and good-looking, but at the same time, he can also go very dark like the Henry Palin character.” Thandiwe is an extraordinary soulful, intelligent actress, says Metz. “I thought of Celia as a spy at the top of her game. This story is about hiding truth and playing double games and Thandiwe made that quality tangible in many tiny ways. I also liked the fact that there is a maturity to Thandiwe. I thought she is a woman and a mother when we meet her in the present day in the script, and she holds that as a person. It gave Celia’s character a lot of gravity.” Metz said Newton is also fun to be around on set.  Shooting the dinner scene which frames the movie was a challenge from a technical perspective, says Metz. “You need to control the light. We designed the restaurant on a stage and created a backdrop with huge LED screens of the real sunset and ocean of the California coast.” Two weeks of shooting in the same setting was tough the director says as there is a limit to how many shots one can invent with two people around the table. “We had to play a game of minimalism. This was a poker game, an interrogation on how to get into Celia and Henry’s mental state.” Light, Metz says was almost like a third character in the room. “We chose to make the journey of light an important part of the film. At the end of the day, when they leave the restaurant, it is night and the sun sets on this conversation. We tried to harness all these little elements into the storytelling as part of the dramatic structure.” A good script does not necessarily have to be faithful to the source novel, Metz says. “Olin, who wrote the novel, also wrote the screenplay of All the Old Knives. He took what he thought was the backbone of his novel and, put it into a screenplay. Olin and I worked on what we thought would be the best film version of the book.”  The film, Metz says, stays true to the core of the book. “The main distinction between literature and film is the former can veer off into all kinds of storytelling that a film cannot.  You have a narrator in literature who can tell you almost anything whereas in film, you have to depend on the visual media. Film is a ‘show, don’t tell’ kind of medium, whereas in literature you have the word. Sometimes the work of translation from one to another is really about creating the visual language and the scenes that capture what you could tell in other ways in a novel.” The film, Metz comments, looks at events over three decades. “During this time the nature of conflicts changed.” Spy stories, Metz insists, can be elevated into great works of art. The director who counts The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, Tinker Tailor, Soldier Spy, and The Third Man among his favourites, says, “The best spy stories talk about how the world changes and how we are caught up in those changes. Tinker Tailor, Soldier Spy has such a melancholic feel. Set after World War Two, the film shows how the West and the East are sucked into their own truths and how the paranoia creates its own realities.”  All the Old Knives  streams on Amazon Prime Video from April 8",Mini Anthikad Chhibber,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/janus-metz-on-all-the-old-knives-a-love-story-and-a-whodunit/article65292428.ece

920,"April 06, 2022",14:45 IST,entertainment,movies,"Explained | Who is Pravin Tambe, the subject of Hotstar’s new cricket biopic?"," The story so far: The OTT platform Disney+ Hotstar released on Friday, April 1, ‘Kaun Pravin Tambe?’, the Shreyas Talpade-starrer cricket biopic of 50-year-old Indian cricketer Pravin Tambe. The film directed by Jayprad Desai, also stars Anjali Patil, Parambrata Chatterjee and Ashish Vidyarthi.  An Indian legspinner and all-rounder who played tennis-ball cricket and club cricket in Mumbai for 20 years without getting to play a single high-level match, Pravin Tambe sprung up in the mainstream at the age of 41, when he was selected by the Rajasthan Royals to play in the Indian Premier League (IPL).  Born in 1971, the cricketer started playing gully cricket at the age of 15 in the Mulund suburb of Mumbai. Tambe dipped his toes in the city’s club cricket scene as a medium-paced bowler in the 1995-96 season of a domestic league of Mumbai’s D division, playing for the Parsee Cyclists Sports Club, according to cricket news site ESPN Cricinfo. He then went on to play in the B Division for the Parsee Gymkhana and eventually, played in the A Division’s top league for the prestigious Shivaji Park Gymkhana, which has churned out many a first-class player for Indian cricket, including Shreyas Iyer, Ajit Wadekar, Vijay Manjrekar and the brothers Baloo and Subhash Gupte.  Tambe’s fate, however, was not slated like other Shivaji Park Gymkhana greats, as he never got a chance to play a first-class match for 20 years from his first club cricket stint.  Tambe’s father, Vijay Tambe, also played suburban cricket in his early years. The cricketer got married in 1999 to Vaishali, now his wife of 23 years. He spent almost the next decade-and-a-half working odd jobs which offered cricket quotas.  He juggled jobs to make ends meet while continuing training and taking part in the maidan or ground cricket tournaments organised by the Mumbai Cricket Association, such as the suburban cricket league called the Thosar Shield Cricket, and the corporate cricket league known as Times Shield Cricket, where teams of companies compete against each other from four cricket divisions.  He first took part in the Times Shield league while working for a shipping company called Orient Shipping. It was here that he began to make the shift from medium-paced bowling to wrist-spinning, after being asked by his team’s captain at Orient to bowl a leg-spin during a crucial match. It was also during his time here that he met India and Mumbai's fast-paced bowler Abey Kuruvilla, who later became the sports director at Navi Mumbai’s DY Patil Sports Academy and a selector at the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).  After playing in the Times Shield for a couple of years, Tambe met with a roadblock when Orient Shipping closed down its cricketing unit owing to budgetary constraints. He resorted to gully cricket matches and local tournaments again, until securing a job at the DY Patil Sports Academy through Kuruvilla’s reference, as a construction supervisor. The academy allowed him to represent its B team and he went on secure them plenty of wins. He was also the Liaison Officer for the initial five years of IPL, when matches were played at the DY Patil Stadium.  All through these years, however, Tambe kept trying to achieve one thing — playing for Mumbai’s Ranji Cricket team. He tried his luck at multiple consecutive selection sessions and was even named in the Ranji Probables between 2000 and 2002. In the late 2000s, he kept getting rejected owing to his age.  In early 2013, while serving as the captain and coach of D Y Patil’s team, he got an 11th-hour chance to play for its A team in an invitational T20 match, replacing a player who got injured. It was this opportunity that became the tipping point of his career.  Little did the cricketer know that the scouts of the Rajasthan Royals were taking notice of him during the invitational T20 match. Rahul Dravid and others from the Royals’ coaching tank had also noticed Tambe when he would frequent their net practice sessions at the DY Patil Stadium.  Some months later, Dravid called Kuruvilla asking him to send Tambe to Jaipur to take part in the Rajasthan Royals selection trials. His selection would have Dravid facing raised eyebrows from team members and the team’s CEO at the time. Tambe, however, managed to make his debut in the IPL in 2013 as the first player to make his entry into the league at the age of 41. He also became one of the few players to make their T20 debut without having played professional first-class cricket matches.  During a 2014 speech at the Design for Change Conference, Rahul Dravid spoke about Tambe as a cricketer who inspires him and “signifies passion” in the game of Indian Cricket.  While he did not play many matches in IPL 2013, he created a spark the same year by receiving the Golden Wicket Award at the Champions League T20 for picking up the highest number of wickets that season. This was also the year that marked the realisation of the cricketer’s Ranji Dream, when he got to represent Mumbai in two first class matches.  During IPL 2014, his pot of wickets was simmering slowly until May 5 that year, when he made history in a match against the Kolkata Knight Riders by taking a 2-ball hat-trick off a wide ball and two legal deliveries, dismissing Manish Pandey, Yusuf Pathan and Ryan ten Doeschate. Tambe also bagged Man of the Match Awards and held the Purple Cap (for picking up most wickets) till the 25th match of that season. He also picked up the wicket of Indian cricket legend and former Chennai Super Kings Captain M.S. Dhoni.  He played for the Royals for two years to then be selected by Gujarat Lions in 2016, but he could not play because of the team’s subsequent suspension of two years. In 2017, he was picked up by and played for the Sunrisers Hyderabad.  In 2018, he announced his resignation from Indian cricket in order to take part in the T10 league Abu Dhabi, as the BCCI does not allow an Indian player to participate in foreign leagues. In that format as well, he set a record by taking five wickets for the Sindhs team in one game, by dismissing Chris Gayle, Eoin Morgan, Kieron Pollard, Fabian Allen and Upul Tharanga in a match against Kerala Knights.  He withdrew his retirement when he was selected by the Kolkata Knight Riders in the 2019 auction to play in IPL 2020. However, he was disqualified because of the above mentioned BCCI rule, for playing in the Abu Dhabi T10 league a year earlier.  In 2020, at the age of 48, Tambe retired again and became the first Indian player to play in the Caribbean Premier League, where he represented KKR’s sister franchise, the Trinbago Knight Riders.  He currently works as a KKR support staff and the team screened his Hotstar biopic for the entire squad on April 1.  Actor Shreyas Talpade, who has previously portrayed a young cricketer in the 2005 film Iqbal, plays Tambe in ‘Kaun Pravin Tambe?’. His wife Vaishali is played by Newton actor Anjali Patil, while Ashish Vidyarthi plays the character of his coach. The film, though adapted from real-life events, has fictionalised elements such as the character of a journalist perennially dismissive of Tambe, played by Kahaani actor Parambrata Chatterjee. Instead of depicting the years of Tambe’s mainstream cricket glory, the film focuses on his journey of 20 years playing local cricket, as he juggled family life and unrelenting disappointment in fulfilling his dream.

The new movie, whose working title is ""K.O. Club"", is inspired by a novel penned by Umberto Eco, the late Italian author and philosopher. Hwang was speaking during a session at MipTV Cannes trade fair along with his producer Jun Young Jang at February Films, reported Variety. The director, also known for Korean films like ""Silenced"" and ""Miss Granny"", teased the forthcoming film will be ""more violent"" than ""Squid Game"". Survival drama ""Squid Game"", which was released in September 2021 on Netflix, revolves around hundreds of cash-strapped contestants who accept an invitation to compete in a series of Korean children's games for a tempting prize, but the stakes are deadly. Also created by Hwang, the show saw a group of masked staff in pink jumpsuits arrive and explain tasks to the players in green tracksuits who would be given 45.6 billion won (USD 38.3 million) in prize money if they can win six games over six days. The director has now shared that he has already penned a 25-page treatment about the project which is bound to be ""another controversial"" project, he added. ""It will be more violent than 'Squid Game',"" teased Hwang, adding that he might have to hide from old people after the film comes out. The director further said he will now return to native South Korea to write the second season of ""Squid Game"" and hopes to have the show stream by the end of 2024. According to Netflix, the runaway success of the first season made the show the streamer's ""biggest series launch"" with 111 million views since debut last September. ""Squid Game"" has also received numerous accolades, including the Golden Globe Award for best supporting actor – series, miniseries or television film for O Yeong-su and the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Award for outstanding performance by a male actor in a drama series and outstanding performance by a female actor in a drama series for Lee Jung-jae and HoYeon Jung, respectively, with all three making history as the first Korean actors to win in those categories.

929,"April 05, 2022",13:38 IST,entertainment,movies,"Meet Jon Batiste, new Grammy winner with plenty going on"," Jon Batiste wears so many hats he may need a closet for them all — recording artist, bandleader, musical director, film composer, museum creative director and scion of New Orleans musical royalty. The multi-instrumentalist won five Grammys on Sunday and despite being on TV all week, not many people may know fully.  Batiste composed music, consulted on and arranged songs for Pixar's animated film “Soul,” a mid-life crisis movie mixed with a New York jazz fantasia and a body-swap comedy. He won a Golden Globe for the music alongside Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross of Nine Inch Nails; and the trio also earned the Academy Award for best original score. For their work on “Soul,” Batiste, Reznor and Ross won the Grammy on Sunday for best score soundtrack f or visual media. Batiste has toured globally with his band Stay Human and made a memorable stop at Comedy Central’s “The Colbert Report” in 2014. When producers of “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” were considering having a house band the following year, Batiste and Stay Human were a natural fit. The mutual respect Colbert and Batiste share is obvious. The bandleader often cheers the comedian's nightly monologue from the piano, appears in segments and accompanies the musical guests. Batiste stuck with the gig even during the pandemic, coming up with tunes, both original and covers, on the spot. Recording since he was a teenager, Batiste's albums include “Hollywood Africans,” produced by T Bone Burnett, “Anatomy of Angels: Live at the Village Vanguard,” and “Meditations,” a collaboration with guitarist Cory Wong. His album “Social Music” spent over a month atop the Billboard and iTunes jazz charts, and he also put together the pandemic benefit album, “Relief: A Benefit for the Jazz Foundation of America’s Musicians Relief Fund.” His eighth album and the Grammy breakthrough was 2021’s “We Are,” a sonic blow-out blending R&B, jazz, hip-hop, marching bands and rock, sometimes in the same song. He earned nods in such various categories as R&B, jazz, American roots, classical, music video and album of the year. Batiste's “American Symphony” is set to premiere at Carnegie Hall in May. Batiste was born into a long lineage of New Orleans musicians, which includes the Batiste Brothers Band and brass band legends Milton and “Uncle” Lionel Batiste. He played drums as a child before switching to piano at age 11. He is a graduate of New Orleans Center for Creative Arts and the prestigious The Juilliard School. The music and culture of New Orleans are highlighted in Batiste’s “Freedom” video, which features the band from St. Augustine High School, which Batiste attended, marching through the city’s streets. “Jon Batiste has been a tremendous ambassador for Louisiana, as an entertainer and as someone who truly cares about the people of our great state,” Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said Monday. Batiste became the first musical director for The Atlantic magazine in 2017 and is co-creative director of the National Jazz Museum in Harlem. He has been featured in ad campaigns for Chase, Apple, Lincoln and numerous fashion brands including Ralph Lauren, Barney’s, Nordstrom and H&M. His song “Freedom” has been showcased across the NCAA Tournament and served as the face of New Orleans ahead of Saturday night’s Final Four at the Caesars Superdome. He also had a role in Spike Lee's 2012 film “Red Hook Summer” and appeared as himself on the HBO television series “Treme.” Batiste is literally the poster boy for the upcoming New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival.

930,"April 05, 2022",13:17 IST,entertainment,movies,Eiza González: ‘Latin women are on the path for better representation’," With roles in blockbusters like Alita: Battle Angel, Godzilla vs. Kong and the Fast & Furious spin-off Hobbes & Shaw, Mexican actor Eiza González has been on the fast track to stardom over the last five years. Eiza, who first hit the limelight as a singer in Mexico – after which she started taking up acting roles – is now basking in the success of Ambulance, the action-thriller in which she co-stars alongside Jake Gyllenhaal and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II. The actor, who plays the role of a certified first responder in the film, has been receiving praise internationally for her take on the character. “Latin women are on the path to better representation. We struggle to get roles in projects that aren’t stereotypical; too often, we are either cast as the lover, the help or the token ‘hot chick’. Not that there’s anything wrong in playing these characters, but there’s more to us than that, right?” she smiles. Eiza, who was first noticed in Hollywood in Edgar Wright’s slick actioner Baby Driver in 2017, adds that her intention is to balance her roles out. “I want to bring characters to life that represent the real Latin community, such as the many dynamic women I know and have been raised by. In fact, Ambulance was a great opportunity for me to show them in a positive light as there’s a high number of Latino people who are first responders in the medical industry.” All set to star next in the Apple TV+ climate change-themed anthology series Extrapolations, as well as the Netflix series adaptation of The Three-Body Problem, Eiza says that Ambulance has given her the inspiration to play more complex characters. “She is the heart and soul of the  movie; so real and conflicted and ends up being the hero. In the first few scenes, she even falls into the unlikable category, which shows that women also get jaded over some things, and they too struggle in industries like this.” This was her second outing with Jake Gyllenhaal, after she voice-starred with him as his wife in the 2021 animation film Spirit Untamed.  How was that experience? “We laughed about it while being stuck inside an ambulance all through shoot; I just found it hilarious that Isabela Merced, who is only like ten years younger to me, was voice-starring as my daughter! That’s the funny thing about animation flicks. But hey, I got to work with Jake, so I can’t really complain.“ ",Gautam Sunder,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/eiza-gonzlez-latin-women-are-on-the-path-for-better-representation-representing-the-latin-community-with-style-and-purpose/article65292202.ece

934,"April 04, 2022",10:38 IST,entertainment,movies,Actor Shiva awaits the release of his first feature film ‘Mr Success’," Coimbatore has a long-standing presence in Tamil cinema through its filmmakers, technicians, and artists. The city, which once housed bustling film studios, might not be the power centre for films it used to be. But its import of talent has scarcely stopped. The latest in this lineup is Shiva Pritham, who is awaiting the release of his first feature, Mr Success, by first-time filmmaker Vijay Chakravarthy. The trailer of the film was released by veteran filmmaker K Bhagyaraj last week at Blacksheep Digital Awards 2022. Though Mr Success will mark Shiva’s debut in feature films, he is not empty of experience and skill. He played one of the leads in YouTube channel black pasanga’s web series, Kaal Kattu. He has also featured in several short films and music videos. To upskill himself, he joined Koothupattarai two years ago. Shiva’s story of how he got into acting is not unique. “From an early age, my parents put me in various extracurricular activities. When I was at college (he did Robotics and Automation Engineering), I thought I should explore the artistic side of me. So, I got myself involved in music videos and short films my friends made.” The story of an engineering graduate entering films has become a cliche in Tamil cinema. But Shiva’s answer to why he wants to be an actor is more interesting. Playing different characters, he says, helps him understand more about himself. “I am vicariously living other people’s lives and experiencing their feelings, which are different from my own feelings. By being different people, I get to access and express all kinds of emotions. It is, in a way, rejuvenating.” Move to Chennai Shiva chose to take up a job in Coimbatore after graduation in 2015. “There is no fixed or steady income in films, when you are starting out. I have to pay out of my own pocket for things like costumes and make-up,” he says, “So, I worked while I was hunting for chances.” He took up most of the opportunities that came his way, including Kaal Kattu. But he soon realised Chennai is the hotspot for cinema. So, in 2017, he moved there after finding a job. The relocation paid dividends soon. “The amount of opportunities increased. It was easier for me to meet people even if they called me at a short notice.” He also began expanding his network. “I started working with Black Sheep YouTube channel. I built a good rapport with the team. There I got to learn about what goes on behind the camera. As an actor, it is important to know those things too.” When Black Sheep made their first feature, Nenjamundu Nermaiyundu Odu Raja, Shiva got to interact with Sivakarthikeyan, who produced the film. “He is someone who had no connections to cinema when he arrived but became a big star on his own. When you meet such people, who have made the journey you are trying to make, you can get to know the dos and don’ts from them.” Another significant moment in Shiva’s acting pursuit after moving to Chennai was joining Koothuppatarai. That place changed his perception of acting. It was, for him, a huge learning curve, which still continues. The mentors at Koothupattarai, he explains, broke down acting into its constituents — voice acting, body language, character study among others. There were exercises to improve on each of these areas.  “There I learnt that acting is not just about your facial expressions. Your whole body should be involved in the process. A bus conductor, for instance, has a particular body language. So, if I am playing a bus conductor, I should observe that on a daily basis and imbibe that. Only then can I express that body language authentically.” The two years at Koothupattarai, he reckons, have vastly improved his acting skills. “I can see the difference myself.” It got him ready for his first feature. Also, like some of the other senior actors from the Koothupattarai stable, including Vijay Sethupathy, Shiva says he is not keen on stardom “I want to be a versatile performer and an entertainer,” he says, “People spend their time and money to see you. So, you are obligated to entertain them. At the same time, you want to satisfy your own interests and expectations as a performer. I will try to strike a balance between the both.”",Praveen Sudevan,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/actor-shiva-awaits-the-release-of-his-first-feature-film-mr-success/article65275078.ece
935,"April 03, 2022",19:19 IST,entertainment,movies,"Estelle Harris, 'Seinfeld' and 'Toy Story' actor, dies aged 93","  Estelle Harris, who hollered her way into TV history as George Costanza's short-fused mother on “Seinfeld” and voiced Mrs Potato Head in the “Toy Story” franchise, has died. She was 93. As middle-class matron Estelle Costanza, Harris put a memorable stamp on her recurring role in the smash 1990s sitcom. With her high-pitched voice and humorously overbearing attitude, she was an archetype of maternal indignation. Trading insults and absurdities with her on-screen husband, played by Jerry Stiller, Harris helped create a parental pair that would leave even a psychiatrist helpless to do anything but hope they'd move to Florida — as their son, played by Jason Alexander, fruitlessly encouraged them to do. Harris' agent Michael Eisenstadt confirmed the actor's death in Palm Desert, California, on Saturday evening. Viewers of all backgrounds would tell her she was just like their own mothers, Harris often said. “She is the mother that everybody loves, even though she's a pain in the neck,” she told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in 1998. The career-defining role came after decades on stage and screen. Born April 22, 1928, in New York City, Harris grew up in the city and later in the Pittsburgh suburb of Tarentum, Pennsylvania, where her father owned a candy store. She started tapping her comedic talents in high school productions where she realized she “could make the audience get hysterical,” as she told People magazine in 1995. After the nine-season run of “Seinfeld” ended in 1998, Harris continued to appear on stage and screen. She voiced Mrs Potato Head in the 1999 animated blockbuster “Toy Story 2” and played the recurring character Muriel in the popular Disney Channel sitcom “The Suite Life of Zack & Cody,” among other roles. She had stopped pursuing show business when she married in the early 1950s but resumed acting in amateur groups, dinner theater and commercials as her three children grew (“I had to get out of diapers and bottles and blah-blah baby talk,” she told People). Eventually, she began appearing in guest roles on TV shows including the legal comedy “Night Court,” and in films including director Sergio Leone's 1984 gangland epic “Once Upon a Time in America.” Her “Seinfeld” debut came in one of the show's most celebrated episodes: the Emmy Award-winning 1992 “The Contest,” in which the four central characters challenge each other to refrain from doing what is artfully described only as “that.” Harris would go on to appear in dozens more episodes of the “show about nothing.” She seethed over snubbed paella, screeched about George's hanky-panky in the parental bed and laid out the spread for screen husband Frank's idiosyncratic holiday, Festivus. “Estelle is a born performer,” Stiller told The Record of Bergen County, N.J., in 1998. “I just go with what I got, and she goes back at me the same way.” Still, Harris saw a sympathetic undertone to her character, often saying Estelle fumed out frustration at her bumbling mate and scheming slacker of a son. Viewers, she told an interviewer in 1998, “just look at her as being funny, cute and a loudmouth. But it's not how I play her. I play her with misery underneath.” She is survived by her three children, three grandsons, and a great grandson.

942,"April 02, 2022",13:13 IST,entertainment,movies,Thaman S: Rhythm comes easily to me," Nearly two decades after he debuted as an actor in director Shankar’s Boys, Thaman is composing music for the director’s next film starring Ram Charan.  Thaman, who has hit a purple patch and is winning appreciation for his chartbuster compositions for star-studded Telugu films, says in a lighter vein, “Rahman sir told me on April 1, last year, that Shankar sir wants me to compose for his new film; I thought it was a joke.” One of the busiest composers today, Thaman took time out for this interview on the sidelines of donating the special edition of ‘The Sportstar’ to a government school in Hyderabad. When the ensemble cast of Boys required an actor who knew to play the drums, Rahman suggested Thaman who was part of his team. Since then, Thaman had been in touch with Shankar and recalls how the director would ask him to get off the stage when others danced, “he would ask me to not spoil it. I was a bad dancer.” Thaman had been nervous about composing for Shankar’s film. “But he made it easy for me and we completed five songs, there is one more to go.” The director told him that this was the fastest music composition for any of his films. Talking of quick compositions, Thaman reveals that ‘Butta Bomma’ of Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo was composed in 15 minutes. There are other films for which it took months to arrive at the music and sound. He cites the example of Bheemla Nayak. Thaman was at sea for six months, experimenting with beats. “Once the title Bheemla Nayak was locked, it somehow fell in place.” The brief was “to sound like a good music band that got lost in the jungles.” He did away with the regular pallavi-charanam format and let the rhythmic beats flow. “I started as a drummer, so rhythm comes to me easily and I blend in different percussions.” Thaman used a range of instruments for the film, including Persian drums.  Soon, Thaman will head to London to work with the philharmonic orchestra for the background score of Sarkaru Vaari Paata starring Mahesh Babu.  There are more international collaborations. “In June, we will be recording in Hans Zimmer’s studio for Godfather. The audio company is working on finalising an international singer, perhaps Beyonce, for a song. With Salman Khan and Chiranjeevi coming together, it has to be special.”  Thaman’s roster includes the sports drama Ghani starring Varun Tej, director Vikram Kumar’s Thank You starring Naga Chaitanya and Pawan Kalyan’s untitled film, which will be a remake of Samuthirakani’s Tamil film Vinodhaya Sitham, with dialogues and screenplay by Trivikram Srinivas.  There was a time when Thaman worked on one film at a time. Today, he navigates between projects, “I am enjoying this phase.”  Though he has been composing since 2009, a turnaround in his approach to music happened with the 2018 film Aravinda Sametha Veera Raghava. “ Bhaagamathie, Mahanubhavudu and Tholi Prema marked the beginning of the second phase of my career. But everything changed for the better with my first collaboration with Trivikram Srinivas for Aravinda Sametha… His suggestions made me pay more attention to the story and screenplay and compose music that complements the narrative.” The learning curve grew with the duo’s next collaboration Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo, which paved the way for Shankar to sign Thaman: “Shankar was impressed with how my music had grown. He has known me since the time I did faltu music.”  Thaman can veer from high pitched beats for Akhanda to a melodious score for a romance like Radhe Shyam. “I used aghora chants and mantras for Akhanda; the film had nine action sequences and heavy dialogues; the music had to match that tempo. Radhe Shyam was my way of paying back my gratitude to UV Creations that gave me a break with Mahanubhavudu and Bhaagamathie. I did not take remuneration, they paid for the musicians and the orchestra.” Thaman mentions how filmmakers are eager to have melodies along the lines of ‘Samajavaragamana’. And hence ‘Antha ishtam’ in Bheemla Nayak and ‘Kalaavathi’ in Sarkaru…  The trend of music composers and singers featuring in the promotional video began with ‘Samajavaragamana’ and has continued with ‘Bheemla Nayak’ title song and ‘Kalaavathi’. “It was Trivikram’s idea. He wanted me and Sid Sriram to feature in the ‘Samajavaragamana’ video.” The promotional video became a rage among film music lovers and audio companies were quick to see the writing on the wall. “These videos work well for promotions in the digital era. Companies are willing to shell out around ₹35 lakh for a good video,” Thaman discloses.

The 60-year-old actor said he has done “enough” and will consider stepping away or taking a break from the movies following his reprisal of the villainous Robotnik in the upcoming sequel. Free Emoji! Don't say I never gave you anything! #DrRobotnikpic.twitter.com/AJ39xwOsk1 “Well, I’m retiring. Yeah, probably. I’m being fairly serious. It depends. If the angels bring some sort of script that’s written in gold ink that says to me that it’s going to be really important for people to see, I might continue down the road, but I’m taking a break,” Carrey said in an interview with Access Hollywood. The star added that he enjoys his “quiet life” and painting. “I really like my quiet life and I really like putting paint on canvas and I really love my spiritual life and I feel like — and this is something you might never hear another celebrity say as long as time exists — I have enough. I’ve done enough. I am enough.” Carrey is not new to extended acting breaks as last year’s “Sonic the Hedgehog” marked his first major role in a studio movie since the 2014 sequel “Dumb and Dumber To.” In between, the actor featured in the independent films “The Bad Batch” and “Dark Crimes.” “Sonic the Hedgehog 2” also features actors Ben Schwartz, Tika Sumpter, James Marsden and Natasha Rothwell. ",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/actor-jim-carrey-serious-about-retirement/article65284049.ece

946,"April 01, 2022",16:17 IST,entertainment,movies,Abhishek Bachchan: Dasvi and lessons in jail," Self-avowedly reticent and borderline apologetic about his work, Abhishek Bachchan has decided to be totally unapologetic about his latest, Dasvi. Why? Because, for him, it’s more than just a film — and a possible catalyst for change.  When we spoke a few days ago, Bachchan had just watched the social comedy and was visibly excited. “I loved it. It touched me, and that’s what a film should do,” he says. For him, it’s an emotional experience that cannot be quantified or categorised. “You just want to see the movie and live in that world, and I hope it has the same effect on you and your readers,” he adds.  Not one to bracket films, he reluctantly agrees that Bollywood typically makes movies that are either outright entertainers or films with a message. But they should be “a mixture of it all” — entertaining the audience, and enriching them. Dasvi delicately traverses this. To “not put too fine a pun on it”, there’s a “learning” at the film’s end, he says, which is not blatant but done through a very entertaining process.  The film, by debutant director Tushar Jalota, is not a commentary on whether politicians should be educated, but rather the journey of a man who realises that education can open up a world of opportunity. He wants to complete his 10th standard, even if from jail.  Bachchan concedes the difficulty of discussing the film without making it sound preachy, “but it’s really not!” he insists. For the actor, his character Gangaram Chaudhary’s greatest learning is that “you have to change” — you can’t be set in your ways because there is a larger world out there waiting to be discovered. Bachchan, 46, describes the character as a political beast for whom manipulating the system “runs in his blood.” But he’s also a loveable rogue. Ganga is a Jaat, a community that Bachchan knows through the Kabaddi team he owns. “They are rough, tough guys, but very emotional at heart”, a trait he tried to imbibe into his character.  Bachchan’s last couple of films (financial and crime thrillers Bob Biswas and The Big Bull) were intense, so he was looking for something lighter when the role came to him. He has played Ganga in a way that is real and relatable. But bringing the gregarious character to life took some preparation. He spent six to eight weeks working exclusively on body language, and the Haryanvi dialect. The latter was the biggest challenge, he admits, and took two months of training with a coach who was also present on set.  Making Dasvi was a collaborative process. Every scene was rehearsed and thoroughly discussed the night before the shoot. Jalota put a lot of faithin the actors, which, according to Bachchan, is what a director should do. “You’ve hired them for a reason,” he says. Yami Gautam plays Ganga’s jailor, and Bachchan loves the David and Goliath symbolism that comes naturally when they share a frame. “Ganga’s greatest opposition and obstacle is physically the smallest thing he’s possibly seen,” he shares. Working with Gautam and co-star Nimrat Kaur, he says, has left him “a far more enriched actor”. While Dasvi was designed for the big screen, Bachchan isn’t disappointed that it’s being released on Netflix and JioCinema — it brings with it the promise of reaching more people. For him, the advent of streaming makes the present a very exciting time to be a content creator. In the last two-and-a-half years, he has done three films, and the show Breathe: Into the Shadows. “Where do you get to do that kind of spectrum of work and get away with it?” he laughs.  For him, the OTT boom has resulted in everyone pulling up their socks because platforms need to have superior products as their competition is global. For instance, he’s just finished shooting the second season of Breathe, which will stream on Amazon Prime Video and compete with the likes of Marvellous Mrs Maisel. According to Bachchan, if you make movie today, it has to be as grand as Avengers or as poignant as any film made across the globe.  Dasvi  releases on JioCinema and Netflix on April 7.",Rutwij Nakhwa,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/abhishek-bachchan-dasvi-lessons-jail-politician-netflix-jiocinema/article65278126.ece
947,"April 01, 2022",16:12 IST,entertainment,movies,Nimrat Kaur: ‘Turning tulsi into poison ivy’ in Dasvi," From global film festival favourite The Lunchbox and Bollywood blockbuster Airlift to American TV show Homeland, Nimrat Kaur boasts a filmography that’s rich and diverse. Shuffling between productions in India and abroad, the actor says she often has to press a mental reset button. To behave the exact same way on a set in America and one in Lucknow would be a disservice to everyone, including herself.  While it’s easy to contrast the organised West with the haphazard East (as an army brat she is a “sucker” for the order and discipline you find in the former) Kaur feels there are pros and cons to both. Things are set in stone in the West, whereas, back home, there is more flexibility. And in the US, people aren’t simply tolerated because they are big stars. Nevertheless, she sees a sea change in the Indian film industry, with a steadily decreasing tolerance for mediocrity and substandard work ethic. “It is no longer fashionable to show up late at work or be cool about being unprofessional.” Speaking of her latest film Dasvi, she is all praise for the “safe, wonderful, and gracious” environment on set, and gives most of the credit to her co-star Abhishek Bachchan, a “lovely, buoyant person”. She says he was mindful of everyone on the set and never let the energy drop. Even during our interview, Bachchan drops by to ensure that Kaur doesn’t miss her lunch.  Kaur, 40, thanks her “lucky stars” for being cast in Dasvi. After Airlift, she was exhausted with the kind of offers that came her way. “Unfortunately, I belong to the breed of people who can’t just sign up for something, where you half love it,” she says. The actor was eager to do something in a genre she hadn’t done before, and Dasvi was the perfect opportunity.  Producer Dinesh Vijan and director Tushar Jalota offered it to her pre-pandemic, in February 2020. She remembers Vijan’s one-line sketch of the character, Bimla Devi Chaudhary (aka Bimmo): a subservient, naïve, simple girl who becomes a circumstantial politician and turns power-hungry. “It was like tulsi going on to become poison ivy,” she laughs. Kaur was sold on the “dream project”, a comedy that required her, among other things, to put on 15 kilos and train in a Haryanvi accent.  She describes Bimmo’s arc as “marvellous” — she goes through the opposite of what happens to her husband (Bachchan), a politician who goes to jail. From someone groomed to get married and take care of the household (a common reality in India’s heartland), Bimmo takes the reins of her husband’s political career and suddenly experiences the freedom of a high-power life. She “goes to town, and realises that nobody is coming between her and her chair”. Playing the role helped Kaur traverse a two-part trajectory: from herself to Bimmo and then to Bimla Devi Chaudhury. It also helped her own the weight and the accent, and not simply “wear it”.   While she doesn’t compare the two roles, Kaur has been fascinated with Tabu’s role in Virasat, which she describes as “funny and demure,” as well as Sridevi’s unintentionally comedic turn in Sadma. Kaur remembers walking away from Maddock Films office after the narration, feeling grateful. She compares the leap of faith to imagine her in the role similar to the one that got her Homeland (based on her performance in The Lunchbox).

951,"April 01, 2022",15:26 IST,entertainment,movies,Aparna Sen’s ‘The Rapist’ goes beyond the culprit-survivor binary," As Kerala remains glued to court proceedings of a molestation case involving celebrities, a multi-layered film, The Rapist, directed by auteur Aparna Sen, goes beyond the culprit-survivor binary to explore why a person becomes a rapist. The Rapist, which bagged the Kim Jiseok Award at the Busan International Film Festival in 2021, struck a chord with viewers of the 26th edition of the International Film Festival of Kerala. Starring Aparna’s daughter Konkona Sen Sharma, Arjun Rampal and Tanmay Dhanania in the lead roles, the film explores how a heinous crime like rape impacts the people involved and society at large. Is it nature or nurture or a combination of both? What circumstances make one a rapist? Speaking over phone from Kolkata, the 76-year-old renowned actor-director, winner of multiple national and state awards, explains why she made a film that tries to understand a society that creates rapists. She says: “A newborn does not become a rapist overnight. He becomes a toddler, a young boy, a youngster... What turns him into a rapist? Rape, say activists and academics, is all about power. I agree. But what makes a person use rape as a weapon, as a way of subjugating a woman?”  She says the theme had been on her mind since the Nirbhaya case and two years ago it crystallised into a story and a screenplay. When a Mumbai-based production house approached her and she narrated this story, they were enthusiastic about it.  But it took some time before the film got the green signal. “I went to Mumbai, met Sameer Nair (CEO of Applause Entertainment) and narrated the story. That was how the producers, Applause Entertainment, came on board,” she recalls. Shot in Delhi over 27 days, the film was completed in 2021. Aparna says the film could have been set only in Delhi as she had conceptualised that as the location. Konkana plays Naina, a criminology professor married to Aftab Malik, essayed by Arjun.  Each character goes through a prism of change after the rape as they grapple with their own long-held convictions. “Aftab, for instance, is against capital punishment but when his wife is raped, he finds himself examining his stand against capital punishment. The lives of Naina, Aftab and Prasad (Tanmay) are changed overnight as a result of that one act of sexual violence.  “When Naina finds she is pregnant, she is not sure whether the baby is her husband’s and that is when she decides to learn more about the rapist. She wants to know if his criminality is in his genes! She wants to find why he raped her.” Choosing her words carefully, she says Naina is ‘pro-choice.’ “Now that does not mean she is in favour of abortion or going ahead with the pregnancy. It means the woman has a choice to decide what she wants to do with it.” When Naina and Prasad talk to each other, the layers are peeled off and at one point Prasad finds himself calling Naina didi (sister). For the screenplay, Aparna spoke to two friends who work with survivors and abused women, doctors and lawyers.  What was it like to work with her daughter on their sixth film? The mother’s pride in her daughter is evident in her words.  “She has become better and better in every way. We speak to each other every day. But we talk about mundane things, what she ate, where she went and in between, she might slip in about an award she has won.  “When she began working with me, she used to listen to me more. Now, she brings in her own interpretation of her character. I was confident that she would be the best for Naina.” She points out that she took care to see that she does not take sides in the film and each character has to navigate his/her own complexities and understanding.

954,"April 01, 2022",10:30 IST,entertainment,movies,Adivasis no longer get the short shrift," One of the characters in Kamal KM’s Pada asks out of frustration, “Does anyone know about them [adivasis] and their way of life? Has anyone spoken to them? On what basis are these laws made to throw them out of the forest?” Thanks to the film, released on March 10, the rights of Kerala’s dispossessed adivasis are yet again the topic of discussion.  Pada is based on the 1996 incident when four activists of the Ayyankali Pada (Ayyankali was a social reformer of Travancore of the early 1900s) held the Palakkad District Collector WR Reddy hostage for nine hours in his office. The trigger - the State government’s 1996 amendment to the 1975 Kerala Scheduled Tribes (Restriction on Transfer of Lands and Restoration of Alienated Lands) Act, aimed at restoring lands to alienated tribal people and preventing the holdings from landing in the hands of non-tribal people. The amendment made most land restoration, mandated by the 1975 Act, unnecessary. The Ayyankali Pada activists were protesting the injustice and were seeking immediate, remedial measures. “If it has provoked a conversation, a discussion, a debate… it can only be good,” says filmmaker and activist Manoj Kana. In 2020, his film Kenjira, in the Paniya language of the Paniyas of Wayanad, won the Kerala State Film Award for the Second Best Film besides other awards.  Pada sticks to the facts of the incident, cinematic embellishment is never at the cost of these and never once does it ‘lose the plot’. It serves as a reminder, a refresher and an introduction to the struggle of the adivasis. Along the way, the film also questions the apathy of successive governments and the bureaucracy. Making the film on a huge canvas, with actors such as Joju George, Kunchacko Boban, Dileesh Pothan, Prakash Raj, Salim Kumar and Vinayakan among others, the film has grabbed eyeballs.   It does not delve into other issues because land, the hills and forests, is everything for the adivasi. Being dispossessed and displaced has birthed their other problems. As the late Justice V. R. Krishna Iyer wrote in his foreword to the report by the People’s Judicial Enquiry Commission into the Muthanga incident - “The quintessence of the tribal issue is their human right to live with dignity in [sic] their lands. Rob their lands, their life is robbed. Restore them to their forest surrounding as of right and you do the adivasis justice.” In the 2003 incident, adivasis entered the Muthanga Wildlife Sanctuary, Wayanad, in an attempt to ‘reclaim’ their lands from where they had been evicted in the 1960s to make way for a wildlife sanctuary. That resulted in police and forest department action, including firing and forcible eviction. Pada ends with a montage that includes footage of these protests, besides others, by and for the adivasis. A serious, political film, it raises more uncomfortable questions than it answers. Back in 1974, the Ramu Kariat film Nellu, based on P. Valsala’s eponymous, bestselling novel, showed the life, ways and sufferings of Wayanad’s Adiyar people. Mainstream [read commercial] Malayalam films that speak about the issues faced by adivasis, who make up one per cent of Kerala’s population, however, have been few and far between. Issues aside, representation, as characters, is also templated. The wise, all-knowing tribal chieftain or moopan with a secret recipe or medicine ( Salt N’ Pepper), the loyal friend ( Iyobinte Pusthakam) or the voiceless victim in need of rescuing or being avenged ( Panchagni, Lal Salaam) are what we usually get to watch. The 2006 Mohanlal film, Photographer, inspired by the Muthanga incident, was perhaps an exception.  The portrayals, characters, costumes et al have been stereotyped, often caricatures and the butt of jokes like in Bamboo Boys and Chitram. Blockbusters such as Thenmavin Kombathu further perpetuated these. What is forgotten, or perhaps not known, is that Kerala is home to 36 Scheduled Tribes but in mainstream cinema, they meld into one amorphous, alien entity. This has done more harm than good for the adivasi people. Malnutrition deaths, starvation, and (the many forms of) exploitation are unsavoury realities that would not set cash registers ringing.  “How many people would watch Kenjira in a movie theatre? How many would be interested?” It was released in theatres, and later, on the OTT platform Neestream. It is, however, not streaming on that platform; he has no figures on the number of people who have watched the film. He intends a theatre release later.”  Over the last few years, there have been smaller films that turned the spotlight on adivasis. Velutha Rathrikal (2015), which explores themes of sexuality, has an adivasi woman, Chelli, at the heart of it. She has agency over her life and choices. Then there is Udalaazham (2018) about a tribal person with gender dysphoria. Born male, Gulikan identifies as female but cannot fully express himself.  Directed by Unnikrishnan Avala, the film, through Gulikan’s story, offers a glimpse into the lives of Paniya tribals. The lynching of tribal, Madhu, in Attapady in 2018, because the starving man ‘stole’ food inspired Painkinjana Chiri, a Paniya short film, directed by Leela Santhosh, who belongs to the Paniya tribe.  Adivasi stories are not easy to tell, especially for outsiders. Kana has lived among and worked with the Paniyas of Wayanad for the better part of the past two decades.  “I have lived with them, travelled and worked with them as a daily labourer, eaten with them…they know me. One has to build a relationship of trust before they let you in. One cannot go there as an outsider looking for a story to make a film and then presume to tell those stories authentically. An insider’s insight brings in the nuances of their multilayered lives, which are not as simple as they look from the outside. These things are complex,” he says.  He has also written and directed plays about adivasis, using them as actors. Kenjira, his film, is told through the eyes of a teenage Paniya girl. It speaks of the issues the Paniyas face. The actors are Paniya people.  Many of these films feature the Paniya language, or the people — as actors and technicians. Vinu Kidulachan, who wrote the lyrics for Pada, is also Paniya. Udalaazham’s lead Mani PR also belongs to Wayanad’s Paniya tribe. He won the Kerala State Award for the best child actor for Photographer. People from other tribes also figure like Nanjamma, who belongs to the Irula tribe, the voice behind the hit song, in the Irula language, from Ayyappanum Koshiyum, ‘Kalakkatha sandana maram vegu vega…’ Kamal KM’s film could be the one that changes the narrative. He stated in an interview, “Questions on caste and oppression will be raised more and more seriously in upcoming Malayalam films. We may never reach a perfect absolute answer with a work of art, but these reflections will help us navigate the new debates that arise around this.”  One can’t help but wonder, if such films do get made, would the audience be interested enough to watch these? Would the economics of the box office permit such attempts?  ",Shilpa Nair Anand,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/adivasis-no-longer-get-the-short-shrift/article65278023.ece
955,"April 01, 2022",10:17 IST,entertainment,movies,Fact Check: ‘The Kashmir Files’ and the disinformation surrounding it," The Kashmir Files, a recent Bollywood movie based on the exodus of Kashmiri Pandits during the nineties has provided fodder for various false and misleading news. Directed by Vivek Ranjan Agnihotri and starring Anupam Kher and Pallavi Joshi among others, the movie has been made tax-free in several States. It has also has rekindled the debate on militancy in the erstwhile State.  Here are some claims circulating in the social media about the movie and the so-called repurcussions it has created.  This is a claim by the director himself. He had tweeted on March 14 that Rhode Island, a State in USA, Rhode Island, ""has officially recognised Kashmir Genocide due to a very small film."" HISTORIC:First time in 32 years, any state in the world, the democratic & liberal state of USA -Rhode Island, has officially recognised Kashmir Genocide due to a very small film.

Journalist Raqib Hameed Naik reached out to Brian Patrick Kennedy, State Representative, Rhode Island and posted his response. ""The citation from the State was to simply recognize the premiere of this movie,"" Mr. Kennedy wrote adding that ""a citation is simply the acknowledgement of a special event. It does NOT hold weight of a Resolution approved by the members of the House.""

As per the RTI,it says 1635 others were killed in the terrorist attack which happened in Kashmir. 89 were Kashmiri Pandits.Why this selective solidarity?The 1635 others had family too, their lives are equally valuable as that of KPs.Who are these 1635 others?#KashmirFilespic.twitter.com/ET19VyXC7t A reply from Srinagar Police Headquarters was being widely circulated with a claim that only 89 Kashmiri Pandits were killed since 1990. Similar claims can be read here, here, and here.  The image is genuine. Hindi newspaper Dainik Bhaskarpublished an article about the RTI. The article mentions the data was of 31 years, that is from January 1990. But the first signs of militancy in Kashmir started in 1988 and the first major attack was in September 1989 with the murder of prominent Kashmiri Pandit lawyer and BJP leader Tika Lal Taploo. This, and several other attacks were not covered in the RTI query.  To a question posed by the then Rajya Sabha member Amar Singh, the MHA on 20.12.2017 said: ""As per the report of State Government of Jammu and Kashmir, 174 cases of killing of Kashmiri Pandits by terrorists have been registered by the Jammu and Kashmir Police."" In 2010, The Hindureported that the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly was informed that 219 Kashmiri Pandits were killed by militants since 1989 while 24,202 families were among the total 38,119 families which migrated out of the Valley due to turmoil. Shujaat Bukhari, the correspondent who wrote the story, was killed by terrorists in Srinagar on June 14, 2018. While there are discripancies over the numbers mentioned by various agencies, it is certain that more than 89 Pandits, and scores of others lost their lives to terror.  Fact check: Misleading A video of L.K. Advani turning emotional during a movie screening, and another one of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on tears went viral claiming it was their reaction after watching The Kashmir Files. Mr. Advani did turn emotional after watching a movie on Kashmir, but it was Shikara. The movie was released in 2020. Vidhu Vinod Chopra Films, which produced Shikara, had organised a special screening for the veteran leader. His reaction was captured and uploaded on their Instagram page on Feb 7, 2020. Vidhu Vinod Chopra, the director of the movie and Mr. Advani's daughter Pratibha are also seen in the clip.  Mr. Adityanath too turned emotional, but the incident happened in October 2017, during an event to honour martyrs in Gorakhpur.  Fact check: False A video clip of a man wearing skull cap speaking against the Indian Army and the Union government, and their alleged atrocities on Kashmiris is being circulated as a deleted clip from the movie.  A reverse image search on a screengrab of the person speaking led us to a Youtube video posted on September 3, 2019. The user has uploaded a Tiktok video in Youtube. We also found a Times of India article dated March 17, 2020 stating that the shooting, which was supposed to begin that week, has been postponed due to COVID-19. An article in Tribune mentioned that the first schedule of shooting began in December 2020 in Mussorie. Fact check: False A clip of a woman assaulting a Muslim man repeatedly in a train, forcing him to fall at her feet and even threatening to kill him, has been shared on Facebook with the claim that the incident was influenced by  The Kashmir Files. A reverse image search proved otherwise. Our investigation led us to a report on the incident by  The Wire. It was dated October 19, 2021 – five months before the film hit the screens. According to the report, the man was assaulted for allegedly pushing the woman while passing through the coach. The woman was identified as Madhu Sharma, a Hindutva leader linked to controversial seer Yati Narsinghanand, who was recently arrested for making a vitriolic speech against Muslim s at a religious conclave in Haridwar (He has since been released on bail).  Fact check: Misleading An image of a man seemingly holding up a placard stating, “Kashmir Files in not a movie. It’s a wake-up call for Hindus,” is doing the rounds on social media. The image also appears to have been taken somewhere outside India. Using a combination of reverse image and keyword search, we found that the placard had been morphed. The original picture had this statement: “Stop using group pics for your dating profile.” The person featured in the image is Seth Phillips, whose idea of holding up cardboard signs featuring pithy remarks about a wide range of contemporary issues struck a chord with the public in the U.S. He was also profiled by  Forbes. He regularly posts images of his unique form of protest on his Instagram account, named dudewithsign. Fact check: Manipulated content",K.

956,"April 01, 2022",00:36 IST,entertainment,movies,Gnanavelraja accuses Sivakarthikeyan of suppressing facts,"  Film producer K.E. Gnanavelraja has accused actor D. Sivakarthikeyan of having suppressed various facts while approaching the Madras High Court with regard to payment of remuneration of ₹15 crore in full for playing the lead role in the 2019 flick Mr. Local.  When the case was listed before Justice M. Sundar on Thursday, the producer’s counsel Vijayan Subramanian submitted a counter affidavit to the case filed by the actor. After taking the counter on file, the judge adjourned the case to April 7.  In the counter affidavit, the producer said Mr. Sivakarthikeyan’s first movie,  Marina, got released only in February 2012. During that period, he had approached the producer on many occasions expressing his desire to act under the banner of Studio Green Films. On March 3, 2013, the production firm signed an agreement with him for making a movie. His remuneration was fixed at ₹1 crore and ₹10 lakh was paid in advance. However, that project did not take off because the actor stopped picking up phone calls, the producer alleged. After various rounds of mediation, the actor agreed to do a movie with the production firm in 2018 but demanded a remuneration of ₹15 crore. A new agreement was signed in July 2018. The old agreement was cancelled but the advance amount was not repaid, the producer claimed. Stating that the film Mr. Local did not do well in the box office leading to a loss of ₹20 crore, the producer said yet he managed to pay ₹12.78 crore to the actor and not just ₹11.11 crore as claimed by the latter. The producer said that a balance of only ₹2.4 crore was due to the actor.

957,"April 01, 2022",00:15 IST,entertainment,movies,A walk down the red carpet," Why does everyone love to hate the Academy Awards? I have been befuddled by this ever since I began watching the show keenly two decades ago. My first year of breathless excitement was one for the record books: when Titanic swept the awards.  Since then, my fascination for Hollywood’s most prestigious awards ceremony has only increased, as my knowledge of cinema and of the lives of the rich and famous have expanded in equal measure. The awards are not just about cheering on the films that captivate us, but getting a ringside seat in order to witness the emotions of the crème de la crème of the film fraternity, on a night when anything can happen. As a film journalist, my excitement for the awards sets in January, when the nominations are first announced. From that moment, I frantically attempt to watch as many missed movies as possible before late February, when the event is traditionally scheduled. This is no mean feat living in India, where award candidates either have staggered/late releases or none at all, though this has improved in recent times with the influx of streaming platforms. Expectations intensify when the Academy host/s are finalised, by which time firm camps are in place for the Best Picture and acting categories. (My favourite category is Best Animated Feature.)  I often stay up the whole night in wide-eyed anticipation instead of setting an alarm to watch the show. There’s always a shocking fashion revelation or faux pas to look forward to. And when showtime begins, I try to figure out if the hosts are going to create a viral moment, such as when Ellen DeGeneres took that famous selfie, or if there is going to be a spectacular train wreck, such as in 2011 when Anne Hathaway and James Franco hosted the show. From the presenters’ banter to the jaw-dropping musical acts to the awards themselves, the Academy Awards are a breathless four hours of elation, heartbreak, shock and surprise. Unlike others, I enjoy watching the post-interviews too, as winners are given a chance to speak in-depth about their craft, as opposed to the dramatic and rushed speeches on the Academy stage. And then comes my one true guilty pleasure: the after parties such as the Governors Ball or the Vanity Fair event where Hollywood royalty cuts loose.  It is a lot to take in. And it’s easy to understand where the reluctance to celebrate this show of avarice and privilege comes from, not to mention the many problems that have surrounded the gala in recent years: the #OscarsSoWhite protest in 2016 and #MeToo and Time’s Up taking center-stage in 2018 in the wake of Academy heavyweight Harvey Weinstein’s conviction. However, it is also important to note that the Academy (unlike, say, the Golden Globe Awards) have acted quickly to correct several fundamental mistakes.  They also provide stars the biggest stage to shed light on issues that are close to them. This often makes the Academy Awards a night of political activism, unlike the popular award ceremonies in India. Whether it is Frances McDormand’s demand last year for an “inclusion rider” in clauses or Ariana DeBose this week batting for queer and Afro-Latina representation, the Academy Awards have always led to heated debates and increased awareness on topics of significance (Of course you looked up ‘alopecia’ too). After having doubled the number of female members and tripled the members of colour, the Academy has put out another promise: from 2025, films will be eligible for consideration only if they meet the standards of two out of four broad groups of criteria.  This time, after two years of the pandemic (and last year’s pared-down event), it was surreal to welcome the stars back to the Dolby Theatre. While there will always be certain riveting moments from the awards that we will remember years later, the Oscars are a great night to appreciate and celebrate the movies, to appreciate and identify with struggles, to see up-close-and-personal the emotions of stars as they unfold, to root for favourites, to enter a world of glamour.

958,"March 31, 2022",17:52 IST,entertainment,movies,Iconic Hindi film ‘Amar Prem’ turns 50," ‘Who can make flowers bloom in a garden that’s destroyed by spring?’ This reflective line written by Anand Bakshi for a song in Shakti Samanta’s Amar Prem (1972) truly makes the song and the film immortal. It has been 50 years since Anand Bakshi and R.D. Burman stoked a spark that continues to light a million hearts. Young women still wait for the elusive Shyam as a dreamy night uncoils. We still quote ‘Kuchh toh log kahenge’ every time we do something unconventional, and we hum ‘Ye kya hua’ when life springs its surprises on us.  Based on a Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay story ‘Heeng Kochuri’ and adapted from Arabinda Mukherjee’s Bengali film Nishi Padma (1970), the innocence that marks the Bangla version remains intact in the Hindi film, as Shakti Samanta asked Arabinda to write the screenplay for it. We see a forbidden space from the eyes of a child. For me, the abiding image of the film is when Nandu, in search of his football, crouches on his knees and peeks from beneath a curtain into a room where a courtesan is honing her dance moves for the evening. Later, he asks Pushpa, the golded-hearted courtesan, what kind of people come to meet her: “Are they your brothers?” The bond between Pushpa and Nandu finds expression in ‘Bada natkhat hai re Krishna kanhaiyya’, composed in raag Khamaj, a song that made a mark only after Pancham’s father S.D. Burman asked him to redo the tune to reflect the prostitute’s sorrow that she cannot be a mother. And Lata too sang it with intense emotionality.  This chaste approach to the prostitute’s character permeates the love story as well, the pyara rishta (beautiful relationship), as Anand describes the platonic bond between him and Pushpa. It reflects in Sharmila Tagore’s eyes, which unleash a seductive storm in ‘Chingari Koi Bhadke,’ and in Rajesh Khanna’s gaze that is always playful, sometimes rakish.  In ‘Chingari’, the lighting and the silhouette of Howrah Bridge in the background cast an enchanting spell; few people know that the song was shot inside Mumbai’s Natraj Studios like the rest of the film.  Anand is slotted into a side act, but Khanna knows how to leave a lasting impression. A man who is emotionally scarred but hates tears, he expresses the duality with charming precision in a role that was played by Uttam Kumar in the Bangla version.  Khanna’s gentle nod and magical blink were enough to arouse the masses. He used his style memorably in scenes like the one where he shows Madan Puri, the pimp who sold Pushpa into the flesh trade, out of her room. After Dilip Kumar’s turn in Devdas, this is another memorable role of a gentleman alcoholic.  However, the cinematic layering around the Nandu-Pushpa story remains problematic. The way Pushpa is in the film as the epitome of womanhood irks, but that was how Hindi cinema dealt with the so-called ‘fallen women’ in that era.  We have seen variants of Pushpa in Pyaasa, Devdas, and, of course, Pakeezah, which were released in the same year. B.R. Ishara’s very different Chetna (1970) was just a minor blip in the mainstream universe that wanted its heroine to be the mythical Sita, sacrificing herself and her happiness to meet social norms.  In Amar Prem, there is a line in the song ‘Kuchh toh log kahenge’ that goes “Sita bhi yahan badnam hui (even Sita was disgraced by this world)”. Later in the story, an artist is shown collecting soil from outside the brothel to create an idol of Durga, a long-time tradition in Bengal. In another scene, Pushpa and women like her are compared to the Ganga, which cleanses all garbage that flows into it. Interestingly, powerful real-life characters like Gangubai, on whom Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s new film is based, were challenging the status quo even then, but cinema opted instead to romanticise sex work. This attitude comes through in each of the films in Samanta’s trilogy of Aradhana, Kati Patang, and Amar Prem. Even though Pushpa walks out of an abusive marriage, when her offensive husband dies, she breaks her bangles to denote grief and widowhood. Though Anand is in a dysfunctional marriage, Pushpa doesn’t think of a lasting relationship with him because she is completely aware that she is a social outcast. Curiously, Anand accepts this logic and moves out. When he returns at the end, it is to hand her over to her foster son. A Pushpa who tries to kill herself at first because she sees no other option is seen taking on a dishwasher’s job towards the end. The screenwriter saddles the protagonist with every possible tragedy so that he can squeeze dry the audience’s tear ducts. Anand might have hated tears but he doesn’t seem to have minded making the viewers cry!

960,"March 31, 2022",15:01 IST,entertainment,movies,Upendra geared up for ‘Home Minister’," Kannada actor Upendra’s Home Minister, directed by Sujay K Srihari is set for a theatrical release on April 1. The actor, popularly known as ‘Uppi’ and ‘Real Star’, is known to think out of the box, when it comes to his film, titles, storyline, direction, acting and promotion.  For Home Minister, he shared a picture of himself in drag and challenged fans to make the image their profile picture. He also created a video featuring himself and his wife, Priyanka, showing him doing household chores while Priyanka relaxed. The video ends with the actor asking his male fans if they are up to accepting this challenge in their homes.  Home Minister, Upendra says is made specifically for women. “They will identify with the characters and the story. The shoot was started even before COVID-19 struck and now the film seems very apt considering what we have lived through.” In the film, Upendra’s character works from home, while his journalist wife has to step out for long hours of work. “The husband prefers to dress as a woman. He is one of the girls, interacting and spending time with the women in the apartment block. The film, Upendra says is a comedy with an unusual ending, for which he credits the director, Sujay K Srihari. Home Minister is Upendra’s first theatrical release post the lockdowns. “We are slowly bouncing back. Films are being screened everywhere and we have seen good footfall in the theatres too.” The two-year hiatus, Upendra says has resulted in films being released together. “Theatres are being crammed with new releases. From the collection point, however, things are soaring. People make the effort to watch a film in a theatre only if they are drawn to the content.” Upendra will soon be donning the director’s hat again, for an interactive film.  He shared a poster on social media and has asked his fans to come up with the title, storyline, choose the genre and build the characters. “This is an experiment and I want to see how this will end. I have started interacting with fans online and we are building the story. I will be directing it, but fans will help me script the story. This is an effort to make it an interactive experience, for me and the audience. ”  Besides this, he is completing the shoot of R Chandru’s  Kabzaa with Kiccha Sudeep.",Shilpa Anandraj,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/upendra-geared-up-for-home-minister/article65276770.ece
961,"March 31, 2022",12:55 IST,entertainment,movies,"For ‘RRR’, cinematographer Senthil Kumar wanted the sharpest visual quality"," K K Senthil Kumar, director of photography for S S Rajamouli’s action drama RRR, is mighty pleased with the appreciation he has been getting for his work. “Filmmaking is teamwork and all of us have put in so much work to give the audiences the best possible visual experience. It is hugely rewarding when people appreciate it,” he says, taking time out for a chat amid location hunting for his next film.  Senthil has worked with Rajamouli since the 2004 film Sye, through Chatrapathi, Yamadonga, Magadheera, Eega and the Baahubali films, each time setting the bar higher for a visual experience. He recalls Rajamouli telling him in the initial stages of Baahubali that he wanted it to be a visual film. “It was music to my ears. What more would a cinematographer want?” That brief had changed for RRR with Rajamouli’s emphasis on not letting viewers’ attention waver from the ‘intense emotional drama’ on screen.  For a fleeting moment, Senthil wondered if there would be scope to showcase something new visually. But he soon dived into the task, determined to translate the director’s vision on screen in the best possible manner. “A part of the challenge was to provide cinematic magic while remaining authentic to the period, the early 1900s,” says Senthil. The production design, costume and visual effects departments collected references from the time period. Photographs and paintings of the era helped study the costumes, bazaars, people’s fashion sense and body language. Senthil also looked at international films that had stories set in the early 1900s. “ Baahubali happens in an undisclosed time period and we had some liberty to do what we wanted. RRR was a new experience.”  The vivid colours and the clarity with which one can spot the details even in a crowd called for meticulous planning and technical know-how. “We more or less decide what colours will work and what to avoid for each scene’s location and the characters. But I keep the look and feel of the final product open till the final stages of post-production. A lot of effort goes into colour grading during the Digital Intermediate stage.” Ram Charan’s introduction sequence amid a sea of protestors takes advantage of the earthy surroundings while NTR’s introduction sequence in the jungle uses the green hues to good effect. Senthil says the intention was to show the differences between the two characters subtly rather than use stark oranges and cool blues simply because the protagonists are represented by the elements of fire and water. Senthil used the large format ARRI Alexa LF camera with signature prime lenses “for the sharpest picture quality”. “When we began working on RRR four years ago, this camera was new. I knew this camera was soon going to be used by big-budget films. With this camera, the focal point has to be correct to the last inch.” For scenes involving large crowds, the background artistes were trained and their movements precisely planned so that when a viewer’s eye travels beyond the main characters, nothing seems out of place. “All this contributes to giving the audiences an immersive experience.” Senthil worked in tandem with the visual effects department in the pre-visualisation of the massive set pieces, be it the ones involving animals or the climactic action sequence. “We did a test shoot before filming Tarak’s (NTR) fight with the tiger. Some of the shots involved him running solo, with the same speed and intensity as though chased by the tiger. We edited and broke down the test shoot footage to analyse the prerequisites — the speed of the animal, the actor and the camera movements to capture them, and how much space should we leave in each frame where the CGI tiger will later be placed,” Senthil explains. Going back and forth with the animation and VFX departments during the pre-production and post-production stages, double checking the placement of the animal and the CGI lighting was an essential part of the workflow. At times, a toy animal was used during rehearsals and then taken away during shoot to avoid its reflection on the actor’s face. For the pre-interval night sequence involving several animals, LED lights and radio-controlled cars came in handy to mark the movements. “The VFX department and my department noted down every detail — placement of lights, distance and the height of the camera, the lens used, the focal distance and the entry point and speed of each animal. The animals were created in CG, played on the monitor and accordingly the actors were asked to move.”  The transformation of Ram into the warrior Alluri Sitarama Raju was designed to be a highlight of the film, with ample backlights to accentuate the character. “This, being a night sequence, was tough. There are (VFX) extensions in the background and for some shots we had to use a blue mat but not let it reflect anywhere else. We used searchlights as part of the action sequence leading up to revealing Ram’s transformation with the backlight (to give him the aura),” adds Senthil, who worked with concept artist Prateek for this sequence. Ask Senthil if the brief was to make Alluri Sitarama Raju’s character look like the mythical Ram from Ramayana and he laughs, “I was not told that. The idea was to make the transformation look dramatic. All through the film, I wanted to showcase the expressions of the brilliant actors, so that audiences will stay engaged with the emotional drama.” Having tested RRR’s picture quality for several formats — normal, wide, Imax, 3D and Dolby cinema, Senthil says the experience has helped him up his technical skills. “I was among the first cinematographers early in my career to film in Super 35 format, use balloon lights and later the first to work on the Digital Intermediate for a complete film. RRR is India’s first Dolby (visual) Cinema. While testing the Dolby visuals in Germany for RRR, I was amazed at the minute details that were noticed. The laser projection and Atmos sound ensure optimum quality. It adds another first to my work and my mission to offer better visual experiences continues.” Rajamouli’s next film is still a few months away and before that, Senthil is working with director Radhakrishna Reddy for a new Telugu film to be produced by Sai Korrapati of Vaaraahi Chalana Chitram, which produced Eega.",Sangeetha Devi Dundoo,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/for-rrr-cinematographer-senthil-kumar-wanted-the-sharpest-visual-quality/article65273800.ece

While we would like to clarify that Mr. Smith was asked to leave the ceremony and refused, we also recognize we could have handled the situation differently,"" the Academy said. The statement from the Academy didn't provide details about who asked Smith to leave. The Academy also apologized directly to Rock in the statement, as well as nominees, guests and viewers. While presenting the Oscar for best feature documentary on Sunday night, Rock cracked a joke about Smith's actor-wife Jada Pinkett Smith, who currently sports a shaved head due to alopecia. After apparently laughing at the quip, Smith walked up to the stage to slap Rock, which will go down as one of the most shocking incidents in Oscars history. Once Smith returned to his seat, he shouted at a seemingly disoriented Rock to take ""my wife's name out of your f***ing mouth."" Smith later went on to win the best actor award for his performance in ""King Richard"". In his maiden Oscar acceptance speech, he apologised to the Academy and fellow nominees but didn't mention Rock. After outrage and many condemnations, including from the Academy, Smith took to Instagram on Monday to publicly apologise to Rock. ""Violence in all of its forms is poisonous and destructive. My behavior at last night's Academy Awards was unacceptable and inexcusable... I would like to publicly apologize to you, Chris. I was out of line and I was wrong,"" he wrote. Next day, Pinkett Smith broke her silence on the controversy in an Instagram post as she shared a brief statement that read, ""This is a season for healing and I'm here for it."" According to The Los Angeles Police Department, Rock was asked by his agent if he wanted to press charges against Smith, but the comic declined. The officers of the Academy's Board of Governors met for an emergency meeting on Monday, and the full board met Wednesday to discuss the incident. In his first public appearance since the Sunday episode at a comedy club, Rock received a standing ovation and a warm welcome from the audience members. He briefly touched upon the elephant in the room, without taking any names. ""I don't have a bunch of sh*t about what happened, so if you came to hear that, I have a whole show I wrote before this weekend, and I'm still kind of processing what happened,"" Rock said, adding that he will talk about the Oscars slap 'at some point'.

963,"March 31, 2022",07:57 IST,entertainment,movies,Chris Rock still processing slap by Will Smith at Oscars,"  Comedian Chris Rock, in his first public comments since he was slapped in the face by actor Will Smith at the Oscars on Sunday, said he is “still processing” the incident that made headlines around the world. “How was YOUR weekend?” Rock asked on Wednesday night of a sold-out crowd at Boston’s Wilbur Theatre. He made it clear from the onset he did not plan to address the Oscars incident at length. “I’m still processing what happened, so at some point I’ll talk about that s***,” Rock told the crowd. “It’ll be serious. It’ll be funny, but right now I’m going to tell some jokes.” At Sunday’s Academy Awards, Rock was on stage to present the trophy for best documentary. He made a joke about Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, that referenced the 1997 film “G.I. Jane” in which actress Demi Moore shaved her head. It was unclear whether Rock was aware that Pinkett Smith has a condition that causes hair loss. Will Smith strode onto the stage and slapped Rock before winning best actor less than an hour later. The actor apologized to Rock and the academy in a statement on Monday. During his 80-minute set in Boston, Rock never mentioned Smith. Instead, he launched into a stream of profanity-laced barbs directed at Great Britain’s royal family, Meghan Markle, former U.S. President Donald Trump, U.S. President Joe Biden, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Subaru, Lululemon and even his oldest daughter Lola. “He came out swinging, but not about Will Smith,” said Ramsay Fretz, a 32-year-old Boston real estate agent who sat in the balcony. “It’s nice to see someone equally attack everybody.” After the slap that reverberated around the world, TickPick, an online marketplace for events, said it sold more tickets overnight to Rock’s “Ego Death” tour than it did in the past month combined. Balcony seat tickets with a face value of $61 fetched nearly $1,000 after Smith slapped Rock in front of nearly 17 million television viewers tuned into the Oscars. ",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/rock-processing-slap-smith-oscars-ego-death-ticket-sale-more/article65276768.ece

970,"March 30, 2022",13:39 IST,entertainment,movies,Three boys on an impossible ‘Mishan’," In 2014, three schoolboys left home from Patna in the hope of tracking down the fugitive underworld don, Dawood Ibrahim and winning a handsome reward from the government of India. The boys were traced by police in New Delhi and sent back home. At the time, aspiring filmmaker Swaroop RSJ was both amused and intrigued by the news and began writing a crime comedy thriller. The story was put on the backburner when he began working on his debut film Agent Sai Srinivasa Athreya with Naveen Polishetty, but he was keen to revisit it. The Telugu film Mishan Impossible, releasing in theatres on April 1, is a fictional story inspired by the three boys. The trailer has caught attention for its humour and pop culture references. In the film, the boys — Raghupathi, Raghava and Rajaram — call themselves RRR and indulge in banter with actor Rishab Shetty (in a cameo) and company who call themselves KGF. “When I wrote it, I did not in the wildest of my dreams think that my film would release in theatres between RRR and KGF2,” laughs Swaroop. Swaroop set the film’s story in Vadamalapeta near Tirupati with the three boys as the protagonists and Taapsee Pannu as an investigator. “Initially I had written a male detective character but I felt it had similarities with Naveen’s character in Agent… So I rewrote it as a female character and thought Taapsee would be ideal. With the work she has done in the last few years in Hindi cinema, I was not sure if she would agree to do a 45-minute role in my film.” However, Taapsee liked the story and agreed to come on board. This is her first Telugu film three years after the Tamil-Telugu bilingual Game Over. The toughest part of Mishan Impossible was choosing the three adolescents. Swaroop and his team auditioned nearly 400 children. “Many on-screen children speak beyond their age. Those who came for the auditions also reeled out popular film dialogues. I selected boys who still had a charming innocence,” says Swaroop. A month of auditioning later, they chose three boys — Harsh Roshan, Bhanu Prakash and Jayateertha Molugu. Swaroop conducted a two-month workshop to ensure that the boys unlearn any filmi overtones and approach their characters afresh.  The film went on floors after the first lockdown in 2020; shooting in a village ensured that they stayed in a bio bubble. “The real challenge was when we resumed filming after the second wave. There were reports that children could be affected. One sequence required 60 to 70 children. We saw to it that the children wore masks all the time except when in front of the camera and maintained social distance.” Swaroop remembers how the kids would log in for online classes from 8 am to 9.30 am, after which the shooting would begin. Agent... and Mishan Impossible reflect Swaroop’s fondness for scripts with crime and comedy. “Thriller, crime and comedy come naturally to me while writing.”  Agent... was written in collaboration with Naveen Polishetty. While developing the script, the two had watched detective films to observe how the plots are developed. For Mishan Impossible, Swaroop had no reference points. “I did not want this to be a typical children’s film. It is a fun film where children are the protagonists. Raghupathi is a film buff, Raghava is an over-smart boy from the village and Rajaram is the innocent one who wants to become a fast bowler. I had to also understand how children from a village would behave in a large city.” He shared the first draft with writer-directors Venkatesh Maha, Bharat Kamma and Vivek Athreya and took their feedback to polish it further.  The Nellore-bred Swaroop traded his corporate career for cinema in 2016. “My interest in cinema was growing and in 2012, I decided that when I make the move, it would be a one-way route. My intention then and now is to narrate stories that are authentic and refreshing.” Why the spelling Mishan? The clue lies in how one of the characters misspells barber as ‘barbar’ as shown in the trailer.",Sangeetha Devi Dundoo,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/three-boys-on-an-impossible-mishan/article65273253.ece
971,"March 30, 2022",11:44 IST,entertainment,movies,"‘Nayika, The Eternal Love’, a music video, fuses a Swathi padam into a Kathakali recital"," Carnatic vocalist Sangeetha N Rao says she visualises a song in her mind as she renders it to make it an evocative experience for her listeners. As a great admirer of the padams composed by Swathi Thirunal and of abhinaya sangeetham, she had often wished she could visualise a Swathi Thirunal padam in the Kathakali format. She says: “I believe that music and dance complement each other beautifully and that’s when a recital feels complete.”  Many of the Swathi padams have already been choreographed by renowned Bharatanatyam and Mohiniyattam dancers. “I have seen and enjoyed many of the performances. I wanted to conceptualise one in the Kathakali format and that too from a woman’s perspective.” The royal composer-musician’s descriptive padam(s) touch upon different kinds of devotion to the main deity of the Sree Padmanabhaswamy temple in Thiruvananthapuram.  Explains Sangeetha: “Of his many padams, one of my favourites is ‘Panimathi mukhi baale’ in Ahiri raga, which is based on ‘madhura bhakthi’. It speaks of the composer’s ardent wish to be one with the Lord. The King portrays himself as a ‘Nayika’ seeking reunion with the Lord.” A brief narrative explains the essence of the composition, that of a Nayika, dressed in her finery, waiting impatiently for her lover in vain. She complains to her friend about the wait while her companion consoles her, praising her looks and beauty.  Sangeetha sought the help of veteran Kathakali exponent Kalamandalam Chambakkara Vijayakumar. He says he made it clear to Sangeetha that he would choreograph a piece that stayed within the artistic framework of Kathakali.  He elaborates: “To do anything else would be an insult to the great art tradition that one takes years to master. Instead of performing vague dance steps in a Kathakali costume, as one sees in many films, I was determined to perform it as a pristine Kathakali performance set to the Swathi padam.” The veteran waited for 10 hours, all made-up and dressed, for the nine-minute video. ‘Nayika’, which was shot at Ozhukil Mana in Palakkad district, is an aesthetic presentation enhanced by Sangeetha’s melodious music. While Vijayakumar appears as the Nayika, Kalamandalam Radhakrishnan dons the role of Krishna and FACT Biju Bhaskar as the companion ( thozhi).  The video, directed by Siva Prasad Pixel, will be released on YouTube on March 31 by Carnatic vocalist Sreevalsan J Menon and music composer Bijibal. This is the third such music-dance video conceptualised by Tripunithura-based Sangeetha, who works as a support vocalist for Mohiniyattam in RV College of Music, Tripunithura.  Her first video was based on a Saraswathi kriti in Saraswathi raga, which she had composed. “It was a pushpanjali presented as a Bharatanatyam recital and choreographed by Abbad Ram Mohan, a former student of RLV college. The next was a bhajan and a Swathi padam. It was not centred on a theme,” she says.",Saraswathy Nagarajan,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/sangeeta-n-rao-has-adapted-a-swathi-padam-for-a-kathakali-recital/article65270102.ece
972,"March 30, 2022",10:37 IST,entertainment,movies,It’s a blockbuster summer," One of my tasks is to report on the financial results of global entertainment giants. Last week, I reported on the 2021 results of Cineworld cinema group, which operates 9,189 screens under the Regal brand in the US and as Cineworld elsewhere. Despite their screens being shuttered from January to May 2021 because of the pandemic, the group recovered from a $3 billion loss in 2020 to a $70 million loss. Revenues soared to $1.8 billion. This was largely due to blockbusters like No Time to Die and Spider-Man: No Way Home in the last quarter of the year. After the results were announced, Cineworld CEO, Mooky Greidinger, made a presentation to all the top international financial institutions. One thing he said stuck with me. “We must say that it’s very rare to have one quarter with mega blockbusters, which are Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness in early May, Top Gun: Maverick end of May, and Jurassic World Dominion in the middle of June,” said Greidinger. “So, really, a great quarter is coming ahead of us.” Until Greidinger put it so bluntly, I hadn’t even begun thinking in terms of summer blockbuster releases. I remember putting together a list of films to look forward to at the end of 2021, then omicron struck. I had an inkling of the riches to come when I went to watch The Batman in IMAX on its opening weekend. Every seat was taken and apart from me and my companion, and very few others, all were gloriously unmasked and pretending, like most world governments, that Covid-19 is over. Trailers for Top Gun: Maverick and Jurassic World Dominion caused much excitement as did a slide for RRR, which is playing around the world as you read this. Unless there is another severe wave of the latest variant, it seems to say that people will throng cinemas to watch films again. That said, people rushed to cinemas at the height of omicron for Spider-Man: No Way Home. Continuing his presentation, Greidinger pointed out the blockbuster delights in store for the second half of the year, including Minions 2: The Rise of Gru, Thor: Love and Thunder, Bullet Train, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, Strange World, Puss in Boots 2: The Last Wish, and Shazam! Fury of the Gods, and of course the long-awaited Avatar 2. The industry wants these and indeed every theatrical release everywhere to be hits. The world wants to put the last two pandemic-blighted years behind and return to whatever normal is these days. And except for some despots who seem hell-bent on WWIII, everyone wants peace. Will we get it? Can the film world’s great and the good who settle into their plush seats at the Cannes Palais for the world premiere of Top Gun: Maverick and the subsequent Tom Cruise retrospective be able to return to the world of film commerce as a war rages to their north?

Known for films such as “Wake Up Sid” and “Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani” also starring Kapoor, Mukerji said the team was perhaps destined to finish the shoot of “Part One: Shiva” in Varanasi, the city believed to have been founded by Lord Shiva according to Hindu mythology. “Some hand of destiny that we finished the shoot of ‘Part One: Shiva’ in Varanasi - a city infused with the spirit of Shiv Bhagwan, and that too at the most sacred Kashi Vishwanath Mandir, allowing us to finish in an atmosphere of purity, joy and blessings. Exciting days ahead, last lap ahead ! 09.09.2022 - Here we come!” the director added. “Brahmastra” stars Kapoor as Shiva, a man with supernatural powers, Bhatt as his love interest Isha and Bachchan as Guruji. The first film will mark the beginning of a new original cinematic universe called the Astraverse, the makers said. Produced by Fox Star Studios, Dharma Productions, Prime Focus and Starlight Pictures, the magnum opus also features Nagarjuna Akkineni and Mouni Roy in pivotal roles. ""Brahmastra"" will be theatrically released worldwide in Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam, with ""RRR"" filmmaker SS Rajamouli presenting the film in South languages.

978,"March 29, 2022",15:44 IST,entertainment,movies,"Radio-controlled cars to miniatures, the making of ‘RRR’s visual spectacle"," Visual effects supervisor V Srinivas Mohan rates his work for SS Rajamouli’s RRR starring Ram Charan and NTR among his most satisfying projects. Mohan has bagged the National Award for Best Special Effects four times — for the Tamil films Magic Magic, Sivaji, Enthiran and the Telugu film Baahubali - The Beginning. Each of these projects, he says, came with its challenges, given the budget and technical expertise available at the time. Baahubali - The Beginning was designed to be a visual spectacle, but Rajamouli’s brief to Mohan for RRR was different: “He told me that it is an emotional drama centred on the characters played by NTR and Ram Charan and that the visual effects should enhance the storytelling without overshadowing it.” However, the task was not simple. The visual effects team, Sabu Cyril’s production design department and cinematographer K K Senthil Kumar were involved in pre-production work for more than seven months. “I liaised with 18 VFX studios and the film had nearly 2800 VFX shots, many of which may not be spotted by viewers. When the VFX does not distract viewers from the drama unfolding on screen, it is a win,” says Mohan. Decoding a few sequences: The action sequences involving animals — tiger, bear, wolves and antelopes — called for extensive pre-visualisation. “When we show NTR taking on a CGI (computer-generated imagery) tiger, the animal has to look realistic to make the audiences believe that a struggle is on. Going back and forth to get the correct look was challenging,” says Mohan. Creating a tiger that looked realistic was one part of the job. The next was to film the action sequence with the actor and an empty space where the tiger will be placed in the post-production stage. The tiger’s speed and movement were calibrated; the camera moves accordingly and the actor emotes on cue.  “The sequence was first designed in 3D on the computer. We then used a Ncam (which aids virtual production through real-time camera tracking) on location. With the help of IIT-Madras students, an LED light strip was created and programmed to move similar to the tiger’s head. When this LED strip is used on location, it gives the actor a good idea of how and when to move and react to an imaginary animal,” Mohan explains.  Radio-controlled cars were employed to replicate the movements of animals that ran amock in a gathering in the pre-interval truck sequence. The cars were operated at specific speeds, their movements were marked and the actors were choreographed to move accordingly. “All this was done keeping in mind that when the CGI animals are placed later in post-production, the episode should look realistic. If the actors appear to be moving aimlessly in the background, it will spoil all the effort.” “Overall, the animation took six months and the LED programming took a month. We worked on nearly 50 animal VFX shots,” says Mohan. The bridge episode that marks the coming together of Ram Charan who is personified as fire and NTR who is personified as water, discloses Mohan, “was 90% visual effects.” “Rajamouli’s son Karthikeya’s friend has a patch of land in Gachibowli, Hyderabad, where some of the scenes were filmed — the public flogging of Bheem (NTR) in the T-junction where thousands of people gather, for example. For the bridge scene, we used a narrow road, a pond and two pillars available in the area. The train was a large miniature. The rest of it was done on VFX.” Several sequences play up the fire and water attributes of the characters of the protagonists. One of the scenes that show NTR amid swaying water pipes was the handiwork of Sabu Cyril’s production team. “They spent two months analysing the speeds and pressure gauges of the water pipes. But the fire scenes were done using visual effects,” says Mohan. Among them, the one that has drawn a lot of appreciation is the transformation of Ram Charan’s character (Alluri Sitarama Raju), almost alluding to the mythical avatar of Ram. “MM Keeravani’s background score was rousing with chants of Ram and Bheem. We had to scale up the visuals to match that intensity. I could not sleep for four nights wondering how we will make it work,” laughs Mohan. Mohan decided that the episode had to be larger-than-life and defy logic instead of striving to be realistic. “I worked with Makuta studio in Hyderabad for this. A dialogue also mentions ‘Lanka dahanam’ (burning of Lanka), so we had to enhance the fire. Makuta, MPC, ReDefine, Surpreez, Firefly Creative Studio, and Digital Domain were the main VFX studios for this film,” adds Mohan, who watched the film 12 times to check the quality in different formats before release. Since the mid-1990s, Mohan has worked as a digital compositor and VFX supervisor for several Tamil films, particularly those directed by Shankar.  He is also on board for Shankar’s next film starring Ram Charan. But before that, he will be taking a break to upskill himself in the nuances of virtual production, an emerging scenario in filmmaking.  Given his technical know-how, it comes as a surprise when he discloses that he dropped out of school in Class XI. Growing up in Vijayawada, he opted out of school due to financial constraints after his father passed. “I then lost my mother when I was 20. I worked as a lorry cleaner and electrician,” he recalls.  A friend helped him financially to learn computer programming and animation. He later took up an animation job in Chennai and worked on marriage videos, before meeting RC Kamalakannan (visual effects supervisor for Baahubali 2 and other films) and began working for films. In 2019, he was invited to be a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences: “This recognition has helped me watch more international cinema and observe how different countries use the visual medium,” he says.",Sangeetha Devi Dundoo,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/radio-controlled-cars-to-miniatures-the-making-of-rrrs-visual-spectacle/article65270051.ece
979,"March 29, 2022",13:29 IST,entertainment,movies,Shabana Azmi’s wondrous experience entering the world of ‘Halo’," Shabana Azmi is just about to make a presentation at the University of Southampton, and it’s a windy day as she gets out of her car and makes her way into the auditorium, where in a few minutes, hundreds of students will assemble to listen to her. “Sorry, it’s been a bit of a hectic day,” she apologises, for the disturbance on our Zoom call from her iPhone, as she recalls how she was cast in possibly one of the most challenging — and unlikely — roles in her decorated career thus far. Even fans who have followed her body of work for decades were surprised when the news broke. The 71-year-old plays the role of Admiral Margaret Parangosky in the sci-fi series Halo — adapted from the iconic video game franchise of the same name — in what is a breakthrough moment for modern-day casting. “The most interesting thing is that the series is completely full of colour-blind casting. Although there are actors from all over the world, they have not been cast due to their ethnicity or their nationality. I have not been asked to put on any kind of accent, or wear a blonde wig... I look and talk the way I do. All the performers, whether they’re Korean, Canadian or African-American, speak the way they do in real life, which for me, is very heartening. Particularly because I’ve been working in the West for the last 30 years, and it’s been a struggle with Asian actors asking for colour-blind casting and wondering why is it that all the best roles go to Caucasians? Finally, I’m seeing some progress in that direction,” she smiles. And indeed, even after nearly five decades in the profession, her choices continue to intrigue us. Apart from Karan Johar’s Rocky Aur Rani Ki Prem Kahani, she is also busy working on British rom-com What’s Love Got to Do With It?, directed by Shekhar Kapur, in which Shabana shares screen space with Lily James and Emma Thompson. Shabana muses, “People really want to see different kinds of stories and different kinds of faces. A few years back, it was unthinkable that after 35, a woman would still continue to get any decent parts… aside from the obligatory bhabhi role. But that space is opening up a lot, and I’m finding it really interesting.” She adds, “I remember when I went to London to start shooting What’s Love Got to Do With It?, and my family was convinced that I wouldn’t be back because it was the height of the pandemic! And yet, we managed to shoot the film in about 48 days, which was even a record of sorts for Shekhar. In the process, I made really good friends with Emma Thompson, whom I’ve been such an admirer of. It was absolutely delightful in the added pressure of working through the pandemic, and made it less stressful for me than if I had been just staying at home waiting for things to clear up.” But back to her current project, one that is being hotly anticipated by a legion of fans worldwide, many of whom have grown up on the games, that has sold over 81 million copies since inception. The Halo universe has since spawned several best-selling novels, short movies, animation projects, and more. “You know, I thought I’d do a soft entry. So, when I met the studio, they gave me some books on Halo. I tried to read them, and then I realised it was very tough, because I had no idea what they were talking about. So I said, alright, let me try and see what the game is — and that was even more difficult! And so I finally decided to just surrender totally to whatever the filmmaker wants, and that was the easiest choice. Believe you me,” she laughs heartily.  The visual image of one of India’s most legendary actors struggling to master a first-person-shooter game on a console, while her husband Javed Akhtar watches on, is amusing no doubt. But then, Shabana has always given it her all for every role — something she attributes to learning from her mother, the late theatre veteran Shaukat Kaifi. “During Halo, there was a lot of work with green screen, and we had to imagine the visuals for which I really had to internalise the character. This is something that I learned to do by the process of osmosis, from my mother; she even used to dress up like her theatrical characters a lot — and that would dictate her walk and stuff like that.” “Obviously, it’s always very challenging to get into a genre that you don’t know at all; it also requires, within yourself, a willing suspension of disbelief to enter an area (video games) that, even as a child or teenager, I wasn’t into. But it suddenly seemed as if an entire parallel universe of Halo lovers descended on me! And I quickly realised, my God, this is something so, so huge, and people have grown up on it with very fierce loyalties. Then it became exciting and the adrenaline rush just takes you through the whole thing,” she grins, with a glint in her eyes. Dramatising an epic 26th-century conflict between humanity and an alien threat known as the Covenant, the series will weave personal stories with action, adventure and an imagined vision of the future; Shabana will share screen space with Hollywood names such as Pablo Schreiber (Master Chief Spartan-117), Natascha McElhone (Dr. Halsey) and Jen Taylor (Cortana). The stars did a boot camp in Budapest to prepare for her role, after which they went straight into shooting. “To develop the character, there were several tests and lots of discussions with the costume designers, who were absolutely fantastic. It’s interesting, because you already attain a certain posture that is dictated by the fact that you’re wearing a costume like this,” she says. “In this, I have to wear almost five-inch heels, which was very difficult to balance for me, but so much care was taken as I have a bad back. I think my training at the Institute (FTII) helped a lot, because one of the first things that we were taught is observation, concentration, and imagination. I’m still very grateful for my training until today.” Shabana’s role of Margaret Parangosky — a no-nonsense, cold and calculating woman — involves a lot of scenes with co-star Natascha McElhone; a collaboration she enjoyed. “My favourite thing about the character is just the fact that she’s so conflicted. She’s an authority figure who gives out commands, but gets manipulated by this scientist who convinces her to break the rules because it’s for the good of humanity. So that conflict was something that Natasha — who exudes so much charisma — and I, particularly when we were doing our readings, understood we need to build onto.” And finally, a word on Halo’s executive producer, none other than Steven Spielberg himself? “He is so laid-back and completely innocuous when he comes, because he leaves it entirely to the director. It’s really refreshing to see what a quiet figure he can be. I mean, of course his aura is palpable whenever he walks into a room, but he tries very hard to play it down and doesn’t give any instructions whatsoever,” Shabana signs off. HALO is currently streaming on Voot Select, with weekly episodes",Gautam Sunder,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/shabana-azmis-wondrous-experience-entering-the-world-of-halo/article65270020.ece
980,"March 29, 2022",12:20 IST,entertainment,movies,Venkat Prabhu on ‘Manmatha Leelai’: We are still conservative about watching two people kiss on screen," There used to be a time when adultery was a recurring motif in the works of Tamil cinema’s legendary filmmakers: most of K Balachander’s were about a love triangle, Bharathiraja made an edgy Sigappu Rojakkal (1978) and a heartwarming Muthal Mariyathai (1985), Balu Mahendra had Rettai Vaal Kuruvi (1987) and Sathi Leelavathi (1995) . Given the history of films, adultery as a concept is not new to Tamil audiences. Nor is it revolutionary. But the space it once had in mainstream cinema died down, believes Venkat Prabhu. This, however, was not the reason why he wanted to explore ‘adult comedy’ in Manmatha Leelai starring Ashok Selvan, Samyuktha Hegde, Riya Suman and Smruthi Venkat. From the films Prabhu caught on OTT platforms over the last two years, the director felt he was only watching “serious” content — whether it was Navarasa, Pava Kadhaigal or Putham Pudhu Kaalai.  “Even the Malayalam films I saw had a serious overtone. I missed watching something ‘fun’. I told my assistant [Mani] about this and he came up with the story [of Leelai] and we both worked on the screenplay,” he says. Venkat Prabhu wants to bring American Pie to Kollywood and Manmatha Leelai is the first step. It was originally conceived for an OTT platform, given the subject. Prabhu, however, clarifies that though it is an adult comedy, it is not crass. But the larger question is: Is there space here for a film like American Pie? “I think people will slowly start opening up to it. We still have a conservative mindset about watching two people kiss on screen. But somehow they watch it secretly on their phones [ laughs]. We have been groomed like that. When you do an adult comedy, it shouldn’t be upsetting for the audience. With new filmmakers coming in, this is bound to change,” he says.  Prabhu says he wanted to prepare the audience for its mature content through promos and trailers, a lesson he learnt from Massu Engira Masilamani’s failure. He knows people have been making jokes already from the trailer, which shows a man getting caught in the act. But Prabhu doesn’t care about them. “In fact, I was asked by someone why I have started making bittu padam [soft porn]. It is only a matter of perspective; you cannot consider every person’s opinion or how they would perceive it,” he says. That brings us to an even bigger question of the hesitancy to show intimacy (not nudity) for a film exploring adultery. Prabhu believes we are still not ready.  “If you take any big web series made in India, there is sex. It is becoming a normal thing but it is not done just for that. It is to show the audience how physically close the couple is. There was a sequence in Manmatha Leelai which needed a lot more detailing. Had this been a straight OTT release, I would have probably added it.” The title font of Manmatha Leelai is taken from both Manmadhan (2004) and the 1976 film of the same name, while the trailer had a song from Bhagyaraj’s  Chinna Veedu (1985). Barring the influences these films had on Prabhu, he says it was to show that his film takes place in two different timelines, “We have tried telling the story of the past and present simultaneously. The story-telling pattern is what excited me. I want to see that excitement on people’s faces. Venkat Prabhu has not had a feature film release since Chennai 600028 II (2016). Even his comeback film Maanaadu, one of the biggest hits last year, was mired in issues leading up to its release.  But Maanaadu was the much-needed validation he was waiting for.  “When you get good reviews, the director gets a high. If the film is making good money, then the producer is happy. I think for Maanaadu everything fell into place. This is what motivates you to keep going,” he adds. When a filmmaker delivers a blockbuster with a star, it is a given that the next film they work on should have an even bigger canvas. At least that seems to be the rule with which Tamil cinema operates — Prabhu agrees too. He says there was a fear that people from his social circle created for Manmatha Leelai, having just delivered a hit.  “In a way, they are also right. This [ Manmatha Leelai] cannot collect like Beast or K.G.F: Chapter 2. We need to calculate numbers based on this film’s market,” says Prabhu, “But look at Malayalam cinema. I don’t think Baahubali was remade in Chinese, but Drishyam was. What I am particular about is exploring different genres and content. At the end of the day, I am a filmmaker, not a businessman.”",Srivatsan S,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/venkat-prabhu-on-manmatha-leelai/article65267187.ece
981,"March 29, 2022",11:05 IST,entertainment,movies,Will Smith apologises to Chris Rock: 'I was out of line and I was wrong'," The day after slapping Chris Rock on the Oscars stage and upending the 94th Academy Awards, Will Smith issued an apology to the comedian, to the academy and to viewers at home, saying he was “out of line” and that his actions are “not indicative of the man I want to be.” The fallout from Smith’s actions during Sunday's ceremony continued Monday as Hollywood and the public continued to wrestle with a moment that stunned the Dolby Theatre crowd and viewers at home. The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences condemned Smith striking Rock, who had made a joke about his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, and said it would launch an inquiry. Later in the day, Smith gave a stronger apology than he did in his best actor acceptance speech, which notably hadn't included an apology to Rock. “Violence in all of its forms is poisonous and destructive,"" said Smith in a statement issued by his publicist and posted on Instagram. “My behavior at last night’s Academy Awards was unacceptable and inexcusable. Jokes at my expense are a part of the job, but a joke about Jada’s medical condition was too much for me to bear and I reacted emotionally. I would like to publicly apologize to you, Chris. I was out of line and I was wrong. I am embarrassed and my actions were not indicative of the man I want to be. There is no place for violence in a world of love and kindness.” The 53-year-old actor added apologies to the film academy, producers of the telecast, attendees, viewers and the Williams family. Smith was honored Sunday for his role as Richard Williams, father of Venus and Serena, in “King Richard.”  “I am a work in progress,” added Smith.  After calling a board of governors meeting Monday to discuss the incident, the film academy said that it review Smith's actions and ""will explore further action and consequences in accordance with our bylaws, standards of conduct and California law.” The Los Angeles Police Department said Sunday it was aware of the incident but was not pursuing an investigation because the person involved declined to file a police report. Smith shocked the Dolby Theatre crowd and viewers at home when he took the stage after Rock, appearing as a presenter, joked: “Jada, I love you. ‘G.I. Jane 2,’ can’t wait to see it.” The joke touched a nerve. Pinkett Smith, whose head is shaved, has spoken publicly about her alopecia diagnosis. Smith strode on stage and slapped Rock across the face. Back in his seat, Smith twice shouted for Rock to “get my wife’s name out your (expletive) mouth.” His words echoed clearly throughout the Dolby, though broadcaster ABC cut the audio for about 15 seconds. Within an hour, Smith won best actor, receiving a standing ovation. During his five-minute acceptance speech, Smith spoke about defending his family. He also apologized to the academy.  Rock's joke wasn't part of his routine during the rehearsals leading up to the show, according to two sources close to production who were not authorized to speak publicly. But Rock had joked about Pinkett Smith before. He hosted the 2016 Oscars, when some were boycotting the ceremony over the #OscarsSoWhite group of nominees, including the Smiths. Said Rock then: “Jada boycotting the Oscars is like me boycotting Rihanna’s panties. I wasn’t invited.” Smith's actions rattled a pivotal Oscar ceremony. Until that moment, producer Will Packer had steered an orderly and lighthearted telecast that the academy hoped would restore the Academy Awards following last year's record-low ratings. Sunday's ceremony reached an estimated 15.36 million viewers, according to preliminary Nielsen company numbers Monday. While a marked improvement over the 9.85 million that watched last year, it was still the second-least viewed Oscars. Some academy members, like writer-producer Marshall Herskovitz, called for the academy to take disciplinary action against Smith. “He disgraced our entire community tonight,” wrote Herskovitz on Twitter. Whoopi Goldberg, a member of the Academy’s board of governors, said Monday on “The View”: “We’re not going to take that Oscar from him. There will be consequences, I’m sure.” The Screen Actors Guild also weighed in. The film, television and radio union called the incident “unacceptable."" SAG said that it had been in contact with the academy and ABC, and it doesn't comment on the guild's own disciplinary process. A sense of disbelief hung in the air at the Dolby Theatre after Smith’s assault. Not only was it a hard-to-fathom break with decorum on live national television — an incident so dramatic, even movie-like, that many initially assumed it was a staged bit — it seemed wildly out of character for one of Hollywood’s most relentlessly upbeat stars. And it came less than an hour before Smith reached possibly the pinnacle of his career, winning his first Oscar, for best actor. “In a way, I feel bad for Will Smith, too, because I think he let his emotions get the better of him, and this should have been one of the great nights of his life,” said former Oscar host Jimmy Kimmel on Bill Simmons’ podcast. “And now it’s not. Was there anyone who didn’t like Will Smith an hour ago in the world? Like no one, right? Now he doesn’t have a single comedian friend — that’s for sure.” Some questioned whether Smith should have been allowed to continue to sit front and center after smacking Rock. Several stars rushed to counsel and calm Smith, including Denzel Washington, Bradley Cooper and Tyler Perry. But the timing was intensely awkward because the best actor category was due up soon after, and Smith had long been considered a lock for the award. “I know we’re all still processing, but the way casual violence was normalized tonight by a collective national audience will have consequences that we can’t even fathom in the moment,” wrote Janai Nelson, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, on Twitter. The drama overshadowed some historical wins at an Oscars. The deaf family drama “CODA” became the first film with a largely deaf cast to win best picture. For the first time, a streaming service, Apple TV+, took Hollywood’s top honor, signaling a profound shift in Hollywood and in moviegoing. Wins for Ariana DeBose of “West Side Story,” Troy Kotsur of “CODA” and Jane Campion, director of “The Power of the Dog,” all had made history.  Others came to Smith’s defense, including Tiffany Haddish, who co-starred with Pinkett Smith in “Girls Trip.” “Maybe the world might not like how it went down, but for me, it was the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen because it made me believe that there are still men out there that love and care about their women, their wives,” Haddish told People magazine. After the show, Smith posed for photographs with his family outside the Vanity Fair party. Inside, cell phone videos captured him dancing to “Gettin’ Jiggy Wit It” while clutching his Oscar. Their son Jaden tweeted: “And That’s How We Do It.” On Instagram, Smith posted: “Me ’n Jada Pinkett Smith got all dressed up to choose chaos.”",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/will-smith-apologises-to-chris-rock-i-was-out-of-line-and-i-was-wrong/article65269826.ece

Sivakarthikeyan has moved Madras High Court accusing producer K.E. Gnanavelraja of Studio Green Films of not having paid his remuneration of ₹15 crore in full for having acted in the movie Mr. Local in 2018-19 and also not remitting Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) to the Income Tax Department.  The actor has urged the court to restrain the producer from making any further investments in the latter’s ongoing projects titled Rebel, Chiyan 61 and Pathu Thala and also injunct him from transferring any rights with respect to the three movies either to film distributors for theatrical release or to Over-the-Top (OTT) platforms.  Justice M. Sundar has listed the case for hearing on Thursday. According to the actor, he had entered into an agreement with the producer on July 6, 2018, for playing the lead role in Mr. Local. His remuneration was fixed to be ₹15 crore to be paid in different tranches with the last of ₹1 crore to be paid before the release of the movie.  Though the movie got released on May 17, 2019, the producer had paid only ₹11 crore by then and the balance ₹4 crore remained unpaid. The balance payments did not come by despite repeated reminders. Suddenly, the actor was also slapped with a notice by the Income Tax Department on February 1 this year.  The notice was issued since the producer had failed to remit TDS for the payment of ₹11 crore. Though the actor filed a separate writ petition in the High Court challenging the notice, ₹91 lakh was deducted from his account for the assessment years 2019-20 and 2020-21 forcing him to file the present case.

983,"April 07, 2022",18:31 IST,entertainment,music,Rashid Khan proves his mastery over khayal," The ‘Teen Prahar’ music festival, organised by the Mumbai-based Banyan Tree Events, was back in Bengaluru after a long hiatus. Held in Chowdaiah Memorial Hall, it showcased Carnatic and Hindustani exponents and featured twilight and night melodies (sandhiprakash and nishakaleen) from the teen prahars (three quads) of the raagdari Hindustani music tradition. The five-hour festival began with ‘Young Blossoms’ featuring artistes of promise. Percussionist Roshan Kolatkar skilfully delineated the diverse aspects of Teental (rhythmic cycle of 16 beats). His lucid execution of the kaidas and his energetic tihais bore the unmistakable stamp of his guru, Pt. Suresh Talwalkar. He was accompanied on the harmonium by the talented Sriraksha, whose mellowed saath was a perfect foil to the vibrant tabla solo. Another young prodigy, Sana Manoj, endeared herself to the audience with her rendition of the famous Tyagaraja composition, ‘Shobillu saptaswara’ in raga Jaganmohini (Rupaka). The disciple of Kalavathi Avadhoot, Sana stole the hearts of the listeners with her earnest attempt to capture the salient aspects of manodharma sangeetam through her evocative alapana and impressive rendition of the composition, ‘Mi valla gunadosha’ in Kapi (Khandachapu).  Her improvisations, marked by neraval and kalpana swaras, and her commendable sense of involvement with the music made it amply clear that the little girl can blossom into a promising artiste. Pranavi’s melodic violin accompaniment and young Sudhanva’s lively support on the mridangam enhanced the concert. Rahul Sharma, son and disciple of Pt. Shiv Kumar Sharma, began his santoor recital with Bhoopali, that hails from Kalyan thaat and is a audav jati raag with five notes. He was accompanied by the pakhawaj virtuoso Pt. Bhawani Shankar and was supported on the tabla by Pt. Ram Kumar Mishra.  His alap-jod-jhala was a nice blend of rhythm and melody. In the jhala in Bhoopali that he performed with Bhawani Shankar, the intricate aspects of the ‘tantrakari ang’ fused with the sounds of the pakhawaj, highlighting the attractive features of the ‘dhrupad ang’.  In the gat, Rahul presented a composition in Mat taal (nine beats), followed by a sparkling Drut Teen taal composition in a faster tempo. He concluded the concert with a lilting Mishr Pahadi composition set to a brisk Dadra (six beats).  Folk-classical collaboration Carnatic violinist Kumaresh surprised the audience by taking up raga Mohanam, the equivalent of raag Bhoopali. He explored the nuances of the raga through his rendition of the Muttuswamy Dikshitar composition. The vibrant phrases in ragas Mohanam, Gamanashrama were matched by an effervescent accompaniment on the mridangam by Arjun Kumar and on the ghatam by Tiruchi Krishnaswamy.  Kumaresh collaborated with the talented Kannada folk singer Suryakanth to perform a folk and classical version of raga Kamboji.  The most-awaited concert of the festival was of Ustad Rashid Khan, one of the most celebrated classical vocalists today. Commenting on his musical skills, Pt. Bhimsen Joshi had said, “The future of North Indian vocal music rests in Rashid Khan’s voice”.  The scion of the Rampur-Sahaswan gharana began with the late evening raag Purva Kalyan. A mood of nostalgia set in, as he took up the traditional bandish, ‘Aaj so ban’ in Vilambit Ektaal, reviving memories of Pt. Bhimsen Joshi’s magnificent gayaki of this vilambit bandish. Keeping with the mood and sensing the expectations of the audience, when Rashid Khan took up the Drut Teental bandish, ‘Bahut din beete, beete’, the signature composition of the late maestro, there was thunderous applause.

984,"April 07, 2022",18:31 IST,entertainment,music,Sushma Soma’s next album ‘HOME’ releases today," As May 2020 stretched on, vocalist Sushma Soma sat in her Singapore home, no concerts in sight and with the pandemic looming large. She was living a life like most artistes at the time: practising, introspecting, exploring, creating. It was at this point that she came across the horrific news of the death of a pregnant elephant after it consumed a pineapple stuffed with firecrackers in Kerala’s Malappuram district.  There was huge outrage across the country. For Sushma, the anger led to the making of ‘Home’, her new album (releasing today on all major streaming platforms). “I reached out to vocalist Aditya Prakash and percussionist Praveen Sparsh, with whom I share a close bond. And we decided to express our feelings through music.”  While she was ideating for the album, Sushma happened to watch the documentary, The Octopus Teacher, which celebrates the beauty of nature. “It made me wonder why can’t we be more appreciative of nature and protect flora and fauna.” Though formally trained in Carnatic music, Sushma chooses to dabble in diverse musical forms when working on her independent ventures. But for ‘Home’, on the advice of her Bharatanatyam dancer-friend Mythili Prakash, she decided to delve deeper into Carnatic music to put across her thoughts and emotions. Along with Aditya, she came up with tracks such as ‘Ma’ that explores the nuances of Shankarabharanam, Bhairavi, and Varali ragas. She also collaborated with Praveen on tracks for which they also roped in parai and nagaswaram artistes.  “Through it all, we marvelled at the fact that while we classify ourselves based on differences, both across cultures and species, in reality we are not so different after all,” says Sushma.  While her first album ‘Sa’ was more an anthology of her favourite musical pieces, recreated by collaborating with some of her closest friends and fellow musicians, the seven tracks of ‘Home’ are “pure emotion”. Pushed by Aditya to take her voice beyond its usual comfort level, she hopes the album is more than just a listen. “It is a tribute to the ecosystem that we share with other beings and a desperate plea to save our incredible home. Hence the title,” says Sushma. The freelance journalist writes on art and culture.",Lavanya Naryananan,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/sushma-somas-next-album-home-releases-today/article65299599.ece
985,"April 07, 2022",18:25 IST,entertainment,music,Parwati Dutta explores dance through Buddhist philosophy," During the pandemic, when live performances came to a halt, Mahagami, the Aurangabad-based dance gurukul, reimagined ways to keep learners and artistes engaged. Along with organising online webinars and workshops, it also created new choreographies. Some of these works were staged at the 13th Sharngadeva Samaroh held recently at the gurukul.  The festival, which opened with the calming Buddhist mandala chanting by the monks of Drepung Gomang Monastery in Karnataka, and concluded with a soulful dhrupad concert by Pt. Nirmalya De, who presented a detailed alap, and the dhruvapada, ‘Pratham sur saadhe…’ in Rageshri as a sadra set to Jhaptaal and a Drut Sool taal bandish in Adana. He was accompanied on the pakhawaj by Pratap Awad and on the tanpura by Veronic. The Odissi dance presentation ‘Arpan’ by the Mahagami ensemble had four segments. The music and choreography was by the versatile Parwati Dutta, the founder of the gurukul. It began with Shiva-stuti, ‘Veda-Sara-Shivastotram’ composed in raag Vibhas, along with ‘Amurta Akshara Thayee’ comprising abstract syllables and ‘Shabda-Swara-Paat’, innovatively incorporating the Sanskrit shloka recited in the metre of Misra Jati Chhand of seven beats.  The second piece was ‘Mudita’ based on Bauddha Darshan (Buddhist philosophy). In the Buddhist tradition, according to the second century Mahaprajna-Paramita Shastra, mudita refers to one of the four immeasurables (apramana) — maitri (loving-kindness), karuna (compassion), mudita (joy), and upeksha (equanimity).  Mudita is traditionally regarded as the most difficult to cultivate because it celebrates happiness and achievement in others even when we are facing tragedy ourselves. The concept of mudita became crystal clear when Parwati shared her own experience and thoughts about the production. “The sudden pause in our lives during the lockdown forced us to adapt to new challenges. The vibrant artistic space suddenly became devoid of the collective resonance of ghunghroos and laughter. While initially, the stillness brought some positive creative stimulation, the frequent sirens of ambulances from the nearby hospital sent chills up my spine. Life seemed to move towards uncertainty. The idea of joy looked like a distant notion. It led me to re-look at mudita,” says Parwati.  The piece was based on raag Madhamad Sarang, which flourished like a pallavi in the emotions of selflessness and compassion.  The third piece ‘Pratibimba’ was based on the ‘darpani’ pose, which is one of the most important bhangis of Odissi. This sculpturesque posture can be seen on temple walls with the Shalabhanjikas holding the mirror. The choreographer reflects on what the woman is looking at. Is she simply admiring her own beauty or examining the connect between the physical and inner beauty.  The pallavi in raag Jog set to Ashta taal explored the different connotations of the darpan (mirror) and the pratibimb (reflection). The concluding piece was based on ‘Om mani padme hum’, the six-syllabled Sanskrit mantra, particularly associated with Avalokiteshwara (the Bodhisattva of compassion), and a primary mantra of Tibetan Buddhism, where the lotus signifies purity and spiritual fruition and thus, awakening. Mani Padme is preceded by ‘Om’ and followed with ‘Hum’, both syllables widely known as divine sounds. The soundscape for this piece was designed aesthetically by Parwati.  It opened with the lingering resonance of the Tibetan metal bowl, blending the deep low-pitch chanting of the monks and the kharaj-sadhana in the dhrupad tradition. A low-tone mardal and ukkuta (mnemonic) recitation provided a musical base for the dance, which was choreographed by Parwati, and in which she maintained the sacred geometry of Odissi, while observing minimalism in movements.  The dancers Vaibhavi Pathak, Aishwarya, Bhargavi, and Sheetal Bhamre did their guru proud with their performance. “The movement vocabulary is inspired by the Thangka and Ajanta paintings,” said Parwati.

987,"April 06, 2022",22:45 IST,entertainment,music,Ed Sheeran wins copyright case over 2017 hit 'Shape of You'," Grammy Award-winning songwriter Ed Sheeran won a U.K. copyright battle over his 2017 hit “Shape of You"" on Wednesday, then slammed what he described as a “culture"" of baseless lawsuits intended to squeeze money out of artists eager to avoid the expense of a trial.  The British pop star and his co-writers, Snow Patrol’s John McDaid and producer Steven McCutcheon, had denied allegations that the song copied part of 2015's “Oh Why” by Sami Chokri, who performs under the name Sami Switch. “Whilst we're obviously happy with the result, I feel like claims like this are way too common now and have become a culture where a claim is made with the idea that a settlement will be cheaper than taking it to court, even if there is no basis for the claim,"" Sheerhan said in a video posted on Twitter. “It's really damaging to the songwriting industry.""  Andrew Sutcliffe, the lawyer for the co-writers of “Oh Why,'' argued that there was an “indisputable similarity between the works.” He claimed that Sheeran had “Oh Why” in his head “consciously or unconsciously"" when “Shape of You” was written in 2016.  The plaintiffs alleged that the refrain “Oh I, Oh I, Oh I” in the chorus of “Shape Of You"" was “strikingly similar” to the line “Oh why, Oh why, Oh why” in their track. During the 11-day trial, Sheeran denied allegations that he “borrows” ideas from unknown songwriters without acknowledgement and said he has always been fair in crediting people who contribute to his albums. In Wednesday's ruling, High Court Judge Antony Zacaroli concluded that Sheeran “neither deliberately nor subconsciously” copied a phrase from “Oh Why″ when writing his smash hit. “Shape of You” was the biggest-selling song in the U.K. in 2017.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/ed-sheeran-wins-copyright-case-over-2017-hit-shape-of-you/article65297276.ece
989,"April 04, 2022",21:00 IST,entertainment,music,Author and storyteller Shyama Panikkar takes children on a hopscotch game of music," ""Music and maths have an unbreakable bond. A song is a melody, composed into a rhythm pattern. Understanding beats and the maths behind beats is very essential in music education,"" says Shyama Panikkar, author and storyteller.  The Mumbai-based artiste recently hosted an online musical storytelling session narrating her recently launched book Bounce, Hop, Raaga Pop. The event was held as a part of an initiative by Librarypreneurs of India to raise funds for a community library in Spiti Valley in Himachal Pradesh.   Trained in Carnatic and Hindustani classical music, Shyama realised the gaps in music education for preschoolers when she could not find any age-appropriate book for her three-year-old son to introduce him to Indian classical music. ""I knew I had to change that,"" says Shyama. This led to her first book A Musical Road Trip in 2020. It is a story which takes the readers through the origin of the seven notes of Indian music and their significance. ""Ancient music literature written during Vedic times mentions that the notes are derived from animal and bird sounds. This information would never be available to children. So I made it into a book,"" says Shyama.  Her second book that was launched in January this year narrates a story about children and their discovery of music through the popular maths game of hopscotch. What follows is a game of making musical patterns with an orchestra of bouncing balls, squawking parrots, cycle bells and anklets.  ""The main objective is to break the perception that classical music is dull and difficult. The book aims to show how music and maths are related and a simple game of hopscotch can be thoroughly enjoyable while singing and jumping through the chart,"" says Shyama. In her endeavour to make the learning experience of classical music interactive and fun, Shyama has been running an Indian music enrichment programme ‘Sur Taal Aur Masti’ for the past three years. The pandemic came as an opportunity to reach out to children across the shores when she started taking the classes in the online platform. “The pandemic has been physically and mentally draining for the children. Music, I feel, is a great source of calm and positive energy for children,” says Shyama.  A telecommunications engineer and a management graduate, Shyama was always fascinated with music. So much so, that she quit her corporate professional career to take up music as a full-time occupation. ""The relationship between music and math has truly intrigued me. Even in my classes, I highlight the mathematical elements to the kids along with the creative elements. I encourage kids to make their own tunes as well,""  says Shyama.  “They first decide on a rhythm structure, put notes into the structure to make a melody and then add their own words. It is an exercise with a lot of creative and intellectual benefits.” To keep the lessons engaging and experiential, Shyama brings all kinds of props to explain to children that music is versatile. “We use kitchen utensils, shakers, spoons and all kinds of metals to demonstrate that music is everywhere,” she says. Shyama also incorporates other forms of art in her music lessons. In one of her online classes, the children learnt a thumri in Raag Hamir.  The thumri described the beauty of Radha in Krishna’s eyes. “At the end, the children where asked to make the image that came to their minds and they made their own versions of the Radha on paper,” recalls Shyama. She feels that Indian classical music is often under-appreciated in early childhood years with most children introduced to western nursery rhymes and children’s songs. “Kids grow up listening to and singing ‘Wheels on the Bus’ and ‘Baby Shark’. But Indian music is considered complicated and boring.” According to her, making learning interactive and introducing children to books on music with colourful illustrations and a storyline works as an effective medium to inculcate musical interest in kids and a curiosity to learn.  Shyama takes online music lessons and can be contacted at her Instagram page @surtaalmasti",Nivedita Ganguly,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/author-and-storyteller-shyama-panikkar-takes-children-on-a-hopscotch-game-of-music/article65273479.ece

991,"April 02, 2022",08:45 IST,entertainment,music,"Grammys 2022: How to watch online, five things to watch out for","  Las Vegas will host the Grammys for the first time ever Sunday, one year after the coronavirus pandemic forced organizers to shake up the broadcast with a cabaret-style show heavy on performances. Music’s most prestigious awards ceremony comes with the entertainment world on edge, just a week after a shocking twist at the Oscars that saw Will Smith slap Chris Rock onstage over a bad joke. The incident is sure to prompt stiffer stage security and script vetting in Sin City, but there’s always a little room at the Grammys for things to get... weird. Here’s a guide to the event, which comedian Trevor Noah will host. Two years after Billie Eilish cleaned up the “big four” prizes – Album of the Year, Song of the Year, Record of the Year and Best New Artist – viral pop sensation Olivia Rodrigo has the chance to do it again. The former Disney channel actress – who posted record-breaking streaming numbers last year during her explosive ascent to pop’s upper echelons – has a total of seven nominations, including in all four of the most prestigious categories. Rodrigo, 19, is among a coterie of pop stars including Justin Bieber and Doja Cat leading this year’s nomination pack. The “drivers license” singer is also slated to perform, as are a variety of acts including BTS, Billie Eilish, Lil Nas X, H.E.R. and nominations frontrunner Jon Batiste. Kanye West, whose legal name is now Ye, released an album both this year and last, but it’s his questionable behavior that has made him music’s chaos agent at-large. He scored five nominations this year, most for his album “Donda” – and will face off with longtime nemesis Taylor Swift in the best album category, where she has her sole 2022 chance at Grammys gold for “evermore.” Neither are necessarily favorites to win the coveted prize. But ever since West’s infamous “I’mma let you finish” stunt at the MTV Video Music Awards in 2009 – when he walked onstage and interrupted the then 19-year-old, who was accepting the award for Best Female Video – all the world’s Ye’s stage. For weeks, the mercurial West has been airing personal attacks on comedian Pete Davidson, who is dating West’s ex-wife Kim Kardashian. The Recording Academy had reportedly removed West from the performance lineup over his sometimes troubling behavior, but some sources said he could still join the lineup at the last minute. And in any event, he’s still invited to the ceremony. Even with seven-second broadcast delays and bleeps, if the Oscars taught us anything, it’s that anything can happen. When the Grammy hopefuls were announced in November, rap mogul Jay Z became the most nominated artist in the show’s history, with 83. He was previously tied with legendary producer Quincy Jones, who had 80. At last year’s ceremony, Jay Z’s wife Beyonce became the show’s most decorated singer in history, with 28 career wins. So far the rap billionaire from Brooklyn has 23 gramophones to his name. But he’s never won in a major category, a similar issue to Beyonce’s, who despite holding a Grammy record for most wins has only triumphed once in the “big four” categories. The Recording Academy faces perennial criticism that it’s too white and too male, and that it relegates Black artists to rap and R&B categories while refusing to reward them with the top prizes. In 2018, Jay Z was the frontrunner with eight nominations, but didn’t win a single award. Needless to say, the couple skipped the 2019 ceremony – and took home a single award, for Best Urban Contemporary Album. Whether Jay and Bey will deign to show up Sunday in Vegas remains an open question. A post shared by Recording Academy / GRAMMYs (@recordingacademy) The perhaps improbable duo of Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga are riding the success of their second duet album “Love For Sale,” which earned six nominations. It was the 61st and final studio album of Bennett’s career. In 2014, the now 95-year-old became the oldest person ever to reach number one on the US album sales chart through a different collection of duets with Gaga, who became his friend and touring companion. The iconic crooner recently revealed he’s been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, a condition he kept under wraps for years. Bennett has stopped touring, but it’s not impossible that he will appear Sunday at Gaga’s side. The 36-year-old pop titan closed last week’s Oscars ceremony alongside Liza Minnelli, another 20th century great Gaga has apparently befriended. In the ever-eclectic Best Spoken Word Album category, which includes poetry, audio books, and storytelling, Barack Obama once again has the leading chance to win what would be his third Grammy. The former president is up for his autobiography “A Promised Land,” two years after his wife Michelle bested her competition to take home the prize for the audiobook of her memoir “Becoming.” Obama – who won the award both in 2006 and 2008 – faces competition from Dave Chappelle, Don Cheadle, poet J. Ivy and LeVar Burton, who is set to host the pre-broadcast ceremony.",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/five-things-to-watch-out-at-grammy-awards-2022/article65283870.ece
992,"March 31, 2022",18:27 IST,entertainment,music,Classical music’s folk links," The importance of the folk tradition is beautifully encapsulated by H.G. Wells’s words: “to record folk songs is to record life”. Though many classically trained musicians believe that ragas evolved from the desi or non-classical music traditions, folk music in India is not given the respect it deserves. Despite each State having its own unique folk music and dance tradition, only a handful of artistes have been honoured with the Padma awards in the 67 years since its inception. Even Sangeet Natak Akademi began awarding folk artistes only after 2007. One wonders at this discrimination, and the unspoken view that folk traditions are “inferior” to the classical. Based on the five types of ‘geeti’ or compositions mentioned in the chapter titled ‘Ragadhya’ in the 13th century Sangit Ratnakara by Śārngadeva, musicologist Arun Bhattacharya wrote, “The development of Indian music continued, from the very earliest times, in parallel and symmetrical lines.” (One culminated in the present raga system and the other in the geeti forms). Music historian O.C. Gangooly in 1938 had referred to tribal influences in music, which later developed into ragas, including Ahiri and Gurjari. Quoting the ancient text Brihaddesi by Matanga, he had pointed out how regional culture too influenced ragas, proved by names like Desh, Gaur and Bangali.  Writing about Indian folk music in 1912, celebrated Irish violinist and a scholar of Indian music, Maud MacCarthy (or Maud Mann), said, “The inexpressibly lovely songs of the folk, which, by their rhythmitonal complexity, far in advance of ours — that is a point to note — suggest the remains of a noble art, rather than the spontaneous expression of untutored natures.” Inarguably, a large element of the iconic Pt. Kumar Gandharva’s music draws inspiration from the folk tradition of the Malwa region. In fact, his daughter Kalapini Komkali goes so far as to say, “His perspective of music changed as a result of his close analysis of the folk music of the region; he understood that the ‘gaumukh’ (source) of this music was the folk tradition. He was the first classical musician to really explore this connection. The seeds of so many ragas such as Bhairav, Bilawal, Bhimpalas, Sarang, Todi to name just a few were visible in folk songs. He used to say, ‘uski jaan chhoti hai, jo naazuk hai, raga ka pet bahut bhara hai,’ which meant that folk songs are sweet little things while ragas can be expanded much more.” In December 2021, singer Malini Awasthi held the 10th edition of her popular folk music festival, Deshaj, in Lucknow. More than 400 artistes from across the country participated.  Despite being trained in the classical tradition, Malini has been working to promote folk music, for which she was honoured by Sangeet Natak Akademi. “My guru Appaji (Girija Devi) fully supported my interest in folk music. In fact, she taught me rare folk songs and encouraged me to sing them. She was a part of my institution, Sonchiraiyya, which presents this festival. Our folk tradition is invaluable — imagine, there are five dialects (Awadhi, Bhojpuri, Braj, Bundelkhandi, and Rohilkhandhi) in which folk songs are sung in Uttar Pradesh alone. Many people don’t know of the ‘charbet’ bandh qawwali/ nautanki tradition of Rampur, sung in Urdu/ Hindi.”  Malini believes that in order to fully understand Indian culture we need to revisit our roots and connect with them and present them well. “Folk artistes may lack presentation skills because it has never been a performance tradition. So one needs to work with them to showcase it for greater appeal,” says Malini.

993,"March 31, 2022",18:11 IST,entertainment,music,Why must we listen to Ed Sheeran or Bollywood remixes in airport lounges," As I write this, I am looking at the ‘airport mix’ — a motley collection of soundtracks that is played at some of the airports. It strikes me that we as a nation do not seem to care too much about showcasing our rich culture and musical legacy at places where it could make a powerful first impression on outsiders, such as airports or public places that first welcome foreign tourists. Instead, what we hear everywhere — from elevators to malls, salons to railway stations — are peppy Bollywood numbers or jazzed-up remixes, some with very regressive lyrics.  This ‘Bollywoodisation’ of pop culture is happening at a time when questions of hegemony and racism otherwise dominate discussions on art. I was recently invited to be part of a panel discussion on ‘levelling and understanding gender diversity and equity in artistic contexts’, where policymakers and institution-builders spoke about the lack of representation of all genders in art, or, for that matter, even the absence of representation of the plurality of India’s traditions. But we do not seem to have an idea about how to make it happen. We are not afraid to call out racism when we see it happen in other countries. We have been somewhat vocal in recent times of India’s non-representation in international socio-cultural and political forums. We get a little prickly that only a smattering of our artistes and cultural output get some sort of consolation prize at the international level. But we seem to highlight the issue only when we feel threatened.  For a long time, I have been calling out how in festivals held abroad — I have seen this especially in the U.K. — the idea of Indian culture is often reduced to either an ethnic-wear parade or a hastily put-together agenda featuring some famous Indian artistes. In these events, the bulk of representation is usually reserved for those with access and superior English language skills, which usually represents a certain class in urban India.  If India, as a cultural plural collective, has to be taken seriously, we must first start by adequately representing the traditionally under-served communities. Public places, schools, malls and airports could perhaps have more music playing from local radio stations or by local artistes, with commentaries, talks, and engaging programming. Non-male representation in art of every region needs to be promoted. Secondly, we need to push for more global representation for India and its considerable artistic heritage. This need not always ride on Bollywood. Already, artistes are putting out some excellent independent work that includes many indigenous ideas and performers — from Prateek Kuhad to the Casteless Collective, from the Tetseo Sisters to the plethora of performers on YouTube. Doing this requires multiple stakeholders agreeing to see things in an aligned manner. As I write this, I am aware that it’s easier said than done. But as a proud Indian, I wonder why listening to Ed Sheeran and a Bollywood remix is all I have as culture therapy wherever I go!

According to Manasi Prasad, director, IME, Birdsong will be on display to the public for four months, before it travels to other parts of the country. “The theme of Birdsong is to bring together the musical and scientific aspects of bird vocalisations. The entire exhibition comprises bird photographs as well as interactive panels that explain the influence of birds on popular and traditional culture,” says Manasi, adding, “There are a lot of ways in which birds have influenced the world of arts and music — from raagas to popular Bollywood numbers and more.” By presenting audio-visual and interactive content, the curators hope visitors to the exhibition will gain a greater understanding and appreciation of the importance of birds — both from an ecological and cultural perspective. “Many people might not be aware of the complexities of different bird calls present in their neighbourhood. Experts have put together various bird calls with photographs and static visual content to aid in the learning process,” she says. Among the many gamified interactive exhibits is ‘Bird Boxing’. “Much like the concept of beat boxing, participants can blend bird melodies with the sound of instruments to create their own piece of music,” says Manasi. A section of this exhibition is devoted to musical instruments inspired by birds, such as the ‘mayuri veena’. Manasi says the inspiration for this theme of birds stemmed from the current ecological situation. “Due to ecological disasters such as deforestation, noise pollution and increased waste, especially in urban areas, the diversity of bird life has drastically reduced. While most people are aware of these dangers, I believe this exhibition which combines music and science, will drive home the importance of birds in our lives.” The cultural performances for the exhibition’s inauguration are also in keeping with its theme. A dance performance choreographed by Preethi Athreya mimics bird movements, while the concert by Germany-based JISR, integrating world music, jazz and ethnic instruments, includes compositions such as ‘Nightingale,’ inspired by bird sounds. JISR will also conduct a free masterclass in world music on March 31 for music students. One can register for the same
at: programs@indianmusicexperience.org. Tickets to the JISR concert on April 1 and the dance performance on April 2 are available on bookmyshow. There will be a free screening of Embryo — A Journey of Music and Peace on April 3.

997,"March 26, 2022",12:34 IST,entertainment,music,Music festivals across the globe unite online for Culturas 360," Jihyun Park, is aware that her audience this weekend might include many who have never experienced Korean traditional music before. Along with her musical partner Minyoung Kim, she forms the South Korean musical duo ReMidas, which will join join 17 other independent acts from countries like Mozambique, Chile, Canada, the US, India, Mexico, Portugal and more at the third edition of Culturas 360, an online musical festival. Over email from Seoul, she describes her instrument of choice that helps her lend a contemporary edge to traditional music. Made from a hardwood tree native to Southeast Asia, the “Gayageum has a large rectangular base made of Paulownia wood. It had 12 silk strings originally, but these days it has been improved, so 25-string Gayageum have also been developed and are used a lot these days,” she writes.  On the other hand, her partner Minyoung Kim will be bringing forth the magic of the Geomungo, an instrument with six strings. “It is a percussion instrument that makes sounds with bamboo sticks. The meaning of Geomungo is ‘black string instrument’, named so because a black crane flew and danced when the instrument was first invented,” explains Jihyun. The duo is deliberate in their quest to create improvisational contemporary music with the use of traditional Korean instruments, while drawing influences from multiple current and ancient cultures, including their own. It is an ideal that is oddly similar to that of Rehmat-E-Nusrat, a Qawwali group based in Uttarakhand, India, that pays homage to Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and other greats while also creating their own compositions and taking the story of Qawwali forward in today’s time.   Sarvjeet Tamta, founder and main vocalist of Rehmat-E-Nusrat, reiterates the role of Sufism in promoting peace, and states how, in today’s climate, embracing the music of Qawwali alone is not enough. The group, since its formation in 2014, has made it to prominent stages across the country including leading social and literary festivals. This weekend, however, Sarvjeet is eager to sit back and take in the magic of musical forms he has not experienced before. Rehmat-e-Nusrat and ReMidas (the latter supported by Chennai-based InKo Centre) are two of the musical talents brought to this stage by Indian festival IndiEarth Xchange. The third and final act in its roster is Mauritius-based fusion seggae (a blend of reggae with sega, the traditional music of the Mascarene Islands) band Jerry N The Resistance.  Other acts include KUNÉ, a Toronta-based orchestra that features musicians and instruments from countries as far apart as Ukraine, Pakistan, Burkina Faso, Cuba, Greece and Peru. Sometimes referred to as Canada’s global orchestra, KUNÉ comprises musicians who hail from all those countries and more, but are currently residing in the greater Toronto area.

998,"March 26, 2022",10:03 IST,entertainment,music,Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins dead at 50," Taylor Hawkins, the longtime drummer for the rock band Foo Fighters, has died. He was 50. There were no immediate details about how Hawkins died, though the band said in a statement Friday that his death was a “tragic and untimely loss.” Foo Fighters were on tour in South America. They played a festival in San Isidro, Argentina on Sunday and had been scheduled to play at another in Bogotá, Colombia on Friday night. “His musical spirit and infectious laughter will live on with all of us forever,” said a message on the band’s official Twitter account that was also emailed to reporters. pic.twitter.com/ffPHhUKRT4 “Our hearts go out to his wife, children and family, and we ask that their privacy be treated with the utmost respect in this unimaginably difficult time.” After Foo Fighters founder and front man Dave Grohl, Hawkins was probably the most prominent member of the group, appearing alongside Grohl in interviews and playing prominent roles in the band’s videos. He also starred in Foo Fighters’ recently released horror-comedy film, “Studio 666,” in which a demonic force in a house the band is staying in seizes Grohl and makes him murderous. Hawkins and other members of the band, Pat Smear, Rami Jaffee, Chris Shiflett, Nate Mendel, are killed off one by one. The film allowed the group, who for decades have been one of rock music’s most durable acts, to have fun while acting out a long-running joke. The film’s premise came out of their work on their 10th studio album at a home in Los Angeles’ San Fernando Valley. Hawkins was Foo Fighters’ drummer for 25 of the band’s 28 years of existence, taking over for original drummer William Goldsmith in 1997. Born Oliver Taylor Hawkins in Fort Worth Texas in 1972, Hawkins was raised in Laguna Beach, California. He played in the small Southern California band Sylvia before landing his first major gig as a drummer for Canadian singer Sass Jordan. He then spent the mid-1990s as the touring drummer for Alanis Morissette before Grohl asked him to join the Foo Fighters. It’s the second time Grohl has experienced the death of a close bandmate. Grohl was the drummer for Nirvana when Kurt Cobain died in 1994.

999,"March 24, 2022",18:30 IST,entertainment,music,On the Dikshitar trail," As Carnatic musician G. Ravi Kiran strolls through the courtyard of the Bhaktavatsala Perumal Kshetra in Tirukkannamangai near Tiruvarur, he is engaged in a discussion with art historian Madhusudhanan Kalaichelvan. Punctuated only by the sounds of nature, their conversation is one of shared passion and common appreciation for the work of Muthuswami Dikshitar. It’s this foundation that brought the two together, leading Ravi Kiran to expand the work of his Guruguhaamrta Trust, and record what they call ‘Dikshita Kshetra Darshanam.’  “I was delighted when Ravi told me about this project. I’ve always been interested in Dikshitar’s works, from the kshetras where they were composed to the way they came to life. While I’ve only scratched the surface with certain pieces on my heritage tours, this project delves into how his kritis represent certain features,” says Madhusudhan. According to Ravi, Guruguhaamrta was launched in 2009 to focus on Dikshitar’s works. He has hosted many annual day celebrations, an annual aradhana at Dikshitar’s samadhi in Ettayapuram, and international choirs and competitions celebrating the composer’s works. “I was inspired by my gurus, R.K. Srikantan and T.M. Krishna, and their personal journeys with Dikshitar’s works,” says Ravi.   The series will be launched on March 24, Dikshitar’s 247th birth anniversary and is designed to appeal to music lovers, learners and heritage enthusiasts. The first season features six episodes that will be released every month and will be available for viewing, for free, on Guruguhaamrta’s YouTube Channel. The first episode features the Bhaktavatsala Perumal Kshetra and is supported by Indic Academy. The music for the trailer has been composed by mridangam exponent K. Arun Prakash.  “Dikshitar’s descriptions of the kshetras or temples and the deities leave much to the imagination, both aurally and visually. Here, we’re attempting to bridge that gap, so to speak. As many of the compositions we’ve chosen are rare, we hope that people will enjoy listening to them being sung in temples,” says Madhusudhan . “Each track comes with immense production values, from the audio quality to the visual experience: we want viewers, especially students, to experience both the location and the music. Dikshitar constructs a musical edifice with each kriti, from the description to the musicality. Our first episode, for example, is set in raga Vamshavathi, one of the 72 raagaanga ragas. These ragas came to life in Dikshitar’s works — as far as we know, there were no compositions in this raga before Dikshitar composed in it,” says Ravi Kiran, who hopes to explore many more finer nuances of the music through the series.

Whether alapana, niraval, swarakalpana or swaraprastara, he is deeply involved, and has a pliable voice that suits the tenor of any composition or raga. For his concert at Madhuradhwani, Balamuralikrishna chose the popular Sahana varnam ‘Karunimpa’ (Thiruvottiyur Thyaga Iyer) as his opening piece, and moved on to present a bhava-laden Abhogi. Tyagaraja’s ‘Nannu brova’ was his selection, and his emotive rendition of the phrase ‘Gajaraja rakshaka’ in the charanam made the composer’s anguish come alive.  The ragas he chose for elaboration were Saveri and Kalyani. While Saveri was rich in melody, Kalyani was vivacious, and each raga was creatively explored to highlight its myriad shades. The sancharas too were developed fully and effectively. Nevertheless, Balamuralikrishna invested more emotions into the Saveri than Kalyani, and it stood out.  The Saveri composition, Periasamy Thooran’s ‘Muruga muruga endral,’ was loaded with poignancy. For Kalyani, he chose Tyagaraja’s ‘Sundari nee divya roopamulaku’, doing justice to the kriti and the elaborate niraval at ‘Kaleelo deena rakshi’, which was backed by swarakalpanas intricately woven with different nadais. The concert concluded with a Lalgudi Jayaraman thillana in Darbari Kanada. It was gratifying to see senior artistes such as M.A. Sundareswaran on the violin, Guru Karaikkudi Mani on the mridangam, and B.S. Purushotham on the kanjira accompanying the young vocalist. While the thani by Mani and Purushotham was precise and subdued, Sundareswaran’s responses on the violin during raga essays and swara sections were significant. Their accompaniment bolstered the spirit of the singer.  The Chennai-based writer reviews Carnatic music.",G.

1001,"March 24, 2022",18:18 IST,entertainment,music,The magic of Maihar," It is said that in 1918 Ustad Allaudin Khan moved to Maihar at the invitation of the ruler, and served there as the chief court musician till his last days. Here, he laid the foundation for the Maihar gharana, and trained several disciples including Ustad Ali Akbar Khan, Pt. Ravi Shankar, Annapurna Devi, Pt. Pannalal Ghosh, Sharan Rani, Ustad Bahadur Khan, and Ustad Aashish Khan. Even today, the sombre statue of Allaudin Khan at a prominent roundabout reminds one of why Maihar is on the cultural map. The Madhya Pradesh Department of Culture, in association with Ustad Allaudin Khan Sangeet Academy (incidentally the Kala Academy was renamed Ustad Allaudin Khan Sangeet Evam Kala Akademy) has been organising the Allaudin Khan Sangeet Samaroh, an annual festival of music and dance, in Maihar. As this year marks the centenary year of Ustad Ali Akbar Khan, son of Ustad Allaudin Khan, the festival was dedicated to him as well as to Pt. Birju Maharaj.   It was inspiring to note the resonance the classical arts seem to have in remote places, as the three-day festival (March 11-13) saw a huge turnout from neighbouring areas including Satna, Rewa, and Gwalior. Held in an open space, the event featured a series of concerts that began at 8 p.m., went on till late in the night, with the last concert ending at around 4 a.m.  An unusual fare  The highlight was the performance by the Ustad Ali Akbar Khan Instrumental Band from Kolkata comprising his grandson sarodist Shiraz Ali, and his son Aashish Khan’s students, Atish Mukhopadhyay and Diptonil Bhattacharya (sarod) and Dishari Chakravorty (santoor). The music team also had Mainak Biswas (pakhawaj), Rupak Mukherji, (flute), Arindam Bhattacharya (vocal), Vachaspati Chakravorty (bass guitar), and Anubrata Chatterji (tabla). They played Ustad Ali Akbar Khan’s compositions, highlighting the maestro’s incredible versatility and creativity.  The festival also included performances by artistes from Madhya Pradesh. Indore-born vocalist Hemangi Bhagat Nene, of the Jaipur Atrauli gharana, rendered raag Bhupali, then a thumri. Hemangi, now based in Hyderabad, is gifted with a clear and soaring voice that reaches the higher octaves without any obvious strain. Indore-based artiste Kalpana Zokarkar enthralled the audience with her stunning and unpredictable ‘taan’ patterns in raag Jog Kauns. She must have learnt these patterns from her father, a student of Ustad Rajab Ali Khan, who was known for his innovative and entirely novel ‘taans’. Kalpana followed it up with an unusual tappa in raag Khamach, concluding her impressive rendition with a Hori.   Vaidehi and Shaili Dwivedi, the sisters from Rewa, chose to sing raag Nand for the occasion. One felt that the duo needs to hone their skills more before taking to the stage. The festival featured Maihar sarodist Himanshu Sen, who played raag Durga. His adherence to the challan of his gharana (Maihar) was creditable. Senior Indore-based vocalist Pt. Gokulotsav Maharaj was at his creative best. He chose Kafi Kanhra as his main raag, and rendered two Horis, quite appropriate to the season. A teacher and prolific composer (his pen name is Madhurpiya), he presented yet another Hori, composed by his grandson Umang, and concluded his line-up with a pleasing composition on ritu basant (the season spring), in raag Basant.  The three-day event also featured dance performances by senior artistes and their students. A Kathakali-Bharatanatyam fusion by Pallippuram Sunil and his wife Paris Laxmi was showcased on day one. The performance by Bharatanatyam dancer Geeta Chandran and her students on the second day was a well-conceived and slickly choreographed presentation to recorded music. Particularly impressive was the piece titled ‘Rasa’, which skilfully combined Bharatanatyam jatis with Krishna’s raasleela in Brajabhumi. The third performance was by Banaras-based kathak dancer and scholar Vidhi Nagar and her team. Again performed to recorded music, the presentation was a mix of innovation and tradition, including the depiction of Holi and a ‘tirvat’.  Financial logistics necessitate dancers to perform to recorded music; this is a disturbing trend. Live accompaniment leads to better expression.  In the traditional style  The focus of the festival was on the instrumentalists belonging to the Maihar gharana — Pt. Vishwamohan Bhatt and his son Salil; Pt. Ronu Mazumdar and his disciple Kalpesh; and Purbayan Chatterji. But the piece de resistance was by Jodhpur-based sarodist Basant Kabra, the chief disciple of Annapurna Devi. His masterly rendition of raag Malkauns was overwhelming, played in the traditional and uncompromising dhrupad style. His aalap jor jhala was superb, and the drut teen taal bandish that he played was his own composition. He ended with an arresting rendition of Zila Kafi, the traditional drut bandish by Baba Allaudin Khan. Anubrata Chatterji’s tabla accompaniment was pleasing.

1002,"March 24, 2022",17:54 IST,entertainment,music,"Remembering a guru, who structured the art of mridangam playing"," A teacher can make a world of difference in a student’s life, right from his regular classes to encouraging him to innovate and engage in the lifelong love of learning. This is what guru Thanjavur V.S. Vaidyanatha Iyer did to his student, mridangam maestro T.K. Murthy, who lived with his guru from a very young age and learnt the nuances of playing the mridangam. T.K. Murthy, now 97, still continues to practise and play mridangam for hours, besides performing in concerts and training students, of different age groups, across the globe.  Thanjavur Vaidyanatha Iyer (1897-1947), though carried the name of a more popular town, was born in Vaiyacheri village located about 10 km northeast of Thanjavur, which is also the birthplace of eminent composers Aanai-Ayya, and the Sivan brothers — Maha Vaidyanatha Sivan, the creator of the 72 mela ragamalika, and Ramaswamy Sivan, a scholar, composer and musician.  The Sivan brothers were Vaidyanatha Iyer’s maternal uncles. Aanai-Ayya composed the kriti ‘Paruvam paarka nyayama’ in raga Dhanyasi, in praise of Mangalambika, the presiding deity of the Agastheeswara-Mangalambikai temple. The village also houses a temple dedicated to Sri Lakshmi Naryana Perumal. At a time when many artistes, with the same name, dominated the music scene, Thanjavur Vaidyanatha Iyer was referred to as ‘Mridanga Vaitha’, for his proficiency in playing the mridangam. The founder of Thanjavur school of mridangam, Vaidyanatha Iyer initially trained under Thanjavur Doss Swamigal, and later came under the tutelage of Kannuswami Nattuvanar, father of Thanjavur K. Ponnaiah Pillai of the Thanjavur Quartet.  “While Kannuswami’s other student, Azhaganambiya Pillai, a stalwart of Thanjavur School of mridangam, played for dance performances, Vaidyanatha Iyer began his career by performing for Harikatha”, says T.K.V. Subramanian, former Head of the Department of History and Dean, Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Delhi, who is now working on the biography of T.K. Murthy. “Vaidyanatha Iyer accompanied exponents such as Harikesanallur Muthiah Bhagavatar, Soolamangalam Vaidyanatha Bhagavatar, and Tiruppazhanam Panchapakesa Sastrigal. His quest to learn more about the concert craft took him to Kodaganallur Subbiah Bhagavatar”, says the professor.  As a teacher Thanjavur Vaidyanatha Iyer, had the natural ability to identify his pupil’s strengths and trained them for concerts. Palghat Mani Iyer, a senior contemporary of T.K. Murthy, Thanjavur R. Ramamurthy, and much later Umayalpuram K. Sivaraman, were all trained by him.   Vaidyantha Iyer used to address T.K. Murthy, as ‘sittu’ or ‘chittu’ (meaning sparrow), for his nimble playing, , and quick-learning skills. Before training under Vaidyanatha Iyer in 1932, Murthy was under the tutelage of his father Thanu Iyer, also known as Appu Bhagavatar, who was a violinist in Trivandrum. When Thanjavur Vaidyanatha Iyer happened to watch Murthy perform at a Ramanavami utsavam, he was impressed and decided to train him. He took Murthy to Thanjavur, where Palghat Mani Iyer was also undergoing training.   Murthy’s maiden performance was at the age of nine at the concert of Musiri Subramania Iyer with Karur Chinnaswamy Iyer on the violin, in Coimbatore. Thus began Murthy’s nine-decade long career in mridangam, in which he has accompanied many stalwarts including Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavatar, Madurai Mani Iyer, Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar, G.N. Balasubramaniam, Mysore B.S. Raja Iyengar, D.K. Pattammal, M.L. Vasanthakumari, T. Brinda and Mukta. Murthy's long concert association with M.S. Subbulakshmi is well-known, including the concert at the UN General Assembly in 1966, where he played the mridangam along with T.H. Vinayakram on the ghatam and V.V. Subramaniam on the violin.  Vaidyanatha Iyer taught the patterns and variations of 35 talas and also let Murthy handle on-the-spot challenges in concerts. When Murthy had a year-long stint at the All India Radio in 1945, he presented 10 of the 108 talas as Laya Vinyasam. “Vaidyanatha Iyer might have listened to this set and added inputs, but it was Murthy who created the patterns for the 108 talas”, observes Prof. Subramanian. Similarly, Murthy has also composed and played mohras and korvais for 35 talas, and 72 melakarta talas. His subtle tonal variations enhances the rhythmic effect of the instrument while playing.  “My thatha, Palghat Mani Iyer, used to say that I should listen to Murthy sir If I want to listen to guru Thanjavur Vaidyanatha Iyer’s style of mridangam playing. ,” recalls vocalist Palghat R. Ramprasad. “Being a senior under the same guru, Mani Iyer too had taught young ‘chittu’ the nuances of playing in concerts,” he adds.  Murthy’s son T.K. Jayaraman, a music composer and director, speaks about his father’s guru bhakti, and how he wanted to give an exclusive performance dedicated to his guru, and his birthplace, Vaiyacheri. “My father was treated more like a son by his guru, and so he still offers the ceremonial oblations and rites to his guru as a son”, he says.   Carrying on the legacy of Thanjavur school of percussion for the past 89 years, Murthy has trained innumerable disciples, who in turn have taken the rich musical tradition to the next generation by training many young aspirants. As a mark of tribute to guru Thanjavur Vaidyanatha Iyer, T.K. Murthy’s School of Music and Trust, and Sri Guhadasa Trust, named after the signature of Sivan brothers, hailing from Vaiyacheri, will present ‘Laya Vruksha Vedika: generations and beyond’, a tribute by the students of Vaidyanatha Iyer and T.K. Murthy, , on March 31, 4 p.m.., at Vaiyacheri Village, Thanjavur. It features performances, demonstrations (of the Thanjavur style of percussion), and a special ‘Laya Vinyasam’ on Sekhara Jhampa, the 81st tala of the 108 talas, by T.K.

The action film James, which was released posthumously, last week, is running to packed houses.  His life size posters still adorn our streets and songs from his films continue to be on top of the musical charts. A song, ‘Ellu Hogilla Nee Ellu Hogilla Appu’, written and composed by Anitha Rangaswamy, is the latest tribute to the actor.  The song, was launched on March 16, Appu’s birth anniversary.  “It is a musical medley, that celebrates the life and journey of our beloved Appu,” says Anitha, who does voice overs for radio. The song features the voices of singers from the Hindi and Kannada Industry. Shankar Mahadevan, Rajesh Krishnan, Anuradha Bhat, Pallavi MD, Hemanth Kumar, Chaitra H G, and Vijay Raghavendra, who is Puneeth’s cousin, have lent their voices to the song. Besides this, the song also features the works of four acclaimed musicians — Alwyn Fernandes (guitar), Akash Parva (keyboard) , Sandeep (flute) and Sarfaraz Khan (Sarangi). The video is directed by Jeevan Claude Dsouza.  Getting Shankar Mahadevan, MD Pallavi and Vijay Raghavendra to contribute to the project was easy as they have worked with her earlier, Anitha said. “They have sung some of the jingles I created in the past. Rajesh, Anuradha, Hemanth and Chaitra are my friends. So their coming together for this song was an organic process. ”The inspiration for the song came from the many who still mourned Puneeth. “People said they were still reeling from the shock of his demise. I felt I had to reverse that feeling. Death cannot kill what never dies. To me and to all Appu’s fans, he is not dead. He may not be with us physically, but, he lives on in our memories and hearts. That is what the title of the song also says, ‘you haven’t gone anywhere Appu’. ”  A huge fan of the late Dr Rajkumar, Anitha says she grew up watching every film the family acted in. “It was apt to create a song for his birthday.”  A long distance runner, Anitha currently works as a copywriter. The passion for music, says Anitha, was always there. “It took a backseat when I lost my mother in 2020. I was lost after she was gone. One day I decided to keep her alive through music and my writing. That is how my first independent song, ‘Endigu Saladu Ninna Preethi Amma’ came into being. Sung by Vasuki Vaibhav, the song celebrated my mother, her life and love for life. I hope that this tribute song will help heal those who are still hurting from Appu’s passing.”",Shilpa Anandraj,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/anitha-rangaswamys-musical-tribute-for-appu/article65251607.ece

The musical snapshot of the city was conceptualised by social activist Abey George and his friends. Listen to why Palayam is a landmark in the city and what is special about Attukal, Beemapally and Kilimanoor. Bustling Chalai market, landscaped grounds of the Napier Museum, the Secretariat and University College are some of the places mentioned in the song. The lyrics touch upon the history, legacy and picturesque locales of the city and its contributions in the fields of education, social reforms, science and so on.  Abey wrote the song during the lockdown. Tired of the cliches making fun of the dialects in the district, Abey decided to capture the diversity and significance of Thiruvananthapuram. “It is almost as if the city is all about the dialect spoken in certain pockets of the district. In one way, it is shaming the language spoken by those living in rural areas and those who work on the land or earn their living from the sea,” he says.  He points out how the city’s vibrant food culture, its legacy as an educational centre of excellence and as the home of the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre and the first Technopark in Kerala have often been ignored. “I wanted to celebrate the city,” he says.  Scored by Suveen Bala, the song has been rendered by singers, many of whom have roots in the city. The rousing number proudly acknowledges its rural dialects. Leading from the front, playback singer Jassie Gift roped in singers who were in the city to be a part of the song. Jassie explains that the song is the result of a group of friends putting their heads together to score the music, render it and capture apt visuals for it. Playback singer Anwar says that it was fun to be part of the team of singers. “Jassi annan wanted me to sing and I was more than happy,” he adds. Actors Manju Pillai and Madhupal, musicians Ardhra Sajan and Gokul Govind are also among the singers.  Veterans like KS Chitra, MG Sreekumar, M Jayachandran, and Kallara Gopan who hail from Thiruvananthapuram could not be included as they were busy with programmes and recordings.  “Two more songs, written by Abey are on the anvil; we wish to include all of them and also younger singers like Vidhu Prathap, KS Harisankar, Aparna Rajeev and others in those songs,” says Suvin.  Actor Jagadeesh, one of the singers, says when he was requested to be a part of the song, he was only too happy to do it. He requested that the video be shot while he was recording as he had several shooting assignments lined up.  Produced by Devi Mohan, Shirley Stewart and Suju C Joseph, ‘Thirontharam’ was directed by George Sebastian. Devi says that the lyricist and producers are all friends and that is how they worked together for the music video.

1005,"March 23, 2022",15:49 IST,entertainment,music,Andrea Bocelli’s son Matteo is the new tenor in Bollywood," Growing up in Fortei dei Marmi, an idyllic seaside town in Tuscany, Italian vocalist and pianist Matteo Bocelli remembers that it was “unusual for the house to ever be quiet”. “The house was always full of music – not just opera and classical music, but also Sinatra, Queen, The Beatles. So, I was brought up with a very eclectic taste and even now I feel like I’m a bit of an old soul when it comes to music,” adds Matteo, who has released three singles from his soon-to-be-released pop debut album.  The 25-year-old son of opera superstar Andrea Matteo is in India to team up with Hindi film playback singers Amaal Mallik and siblings Prakriti and Sukriti Kakar for a track. “This is a collaboration that I’ve always dreamt of - I feel honoured to have done this with amazing talents such as Amaal Mallik, Sukriti and Prakriti. I started with the best,” says Matteo. In 2021, Mallik and the Kakar sisters worked on the Indian remix of Grammy award-winning British pop vocalist Dua Lipa’s track Levitating, earning praise from the singer, who called the mix a “gift to her Indian fans”. Matteo, who has already released a Spanish version ( Dime) of his new Italian single Dimmi adds that he loves the challenge of making a song work in another language. So, it isn’t surprising that he turned to India for a new collaboration. “I think collaborations are important when they come in an authentic and natural way. I felt authenticity with these people (Mallik and the Kakar sisters) and they’re not only amazing talents, but beautiful people, so I’m enjoying the moment and I can’t wait for everyone to listen to the song,” he adds. No stranger to musical partnerships, Matteo first collaborated with his father for Fall On Me, the bilingual track in English and Italian for his father’s album, ‘Si’. The track, which Matteo sang and co-wrote, was included in the soundtrack of the Disney blockbuster film The Nutcracker and The Four Realms. “I’m extremely grateful to my father for giving me so many incredible opportunities to develop myself musically before setting out on my own. Fall On Me brought us much closer together, not just as father and son but as musicians working together. We really trust each other,” says Matteo of his musical bond with his father.  His debut, however, does not feature the opera legend even though he turned to his father when he wanted to choose the final list of tracks for the album from a set of 80 tracks that Matteo has composed until date. “The record explores the themes of love and life with a light-hearted, fun touch,” says the singer, who also draws from his childhood for the album. His classical training at home under his father’s tutelage and at the Conservatory of Lucca is an integral part of the music he makes. “My classical training is such an inherent part of me – there’s no escaping it in my music. I can’t say how my songs would sound without that training. I always approach each track from a technical perspective. I’m obsessed with how each element of the music is built and layered together. At the same time, I love working with composers and collaborators from the pop world to bring in other ideas and styles.” 
“My classical training is such an inherent part of me – there’s no escaping it in my music. I can’t say how my songs would sound without that training. I always approach each track from a technical perspective. ”Matteo Bocelli Italian vocalist and pianist  Besides his father, Matteo also credits influential music producer David Foster for his musical career. Matteo made his US stage debut in 2017, performing as part of ‘David Foster and Friends’ in Washington DC alongside artistes such as Celine Dion, Josh Groban and Blake Shelton. “Quite simply, without David Foster there would definitely be no Matteo Bocelli! David was the first person to tell me I belonged on stage. Before David, I wasn’t even thinking about a singing career possibility – I just knew I loved music and wanted to be in that world. David was the person who said to me, ‘you have the technical capabilities to do this, you have the skills, go and do it.’ My biggest take-away from David was, ‘There’s never going to be a second first impression.’ It’s always important to give every performance everything you have because everyone is watching and you will be judged on it,” says Matteo. Lalitha Suhasini teaches journalism at Flame University",Lalitha Suhasini,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/andrea-bocellis-son-matteo-is-the-new-tenor-in-bollywood/article65252061.ece

1007,"March 19, 2022",10:37 IST,entertainment,music,Tribute to Kathakali musician Tiruvalla Gopikuttan Nair," All his life, Tiruvalla Gopikuttan Nair rebelled against a popular trend in Kathakali music by sticking to his aesthetic convictions and suffering their flip side. As a Kathakali vocalist , he believed that emotive lyrics should no more tread the austere Sopanam system followed in Kerala temples. He also desisted from Carnaticising renditions, seldom trying complex gamakas or vibrant brigas. Alongside, he nurtured a love for vintage film and folk songs. The result was a unique ornamentation that sounded contemporary while thriving on minimalism. Nair, 78, passed away recently. Kathakali has lost its last protestor against the northern school of vocals that has come to define the dance-theatre’s mainstream playback in the past half-a-century. The overarching Kalamandalam-style music comes with an “indistinct pronunciation typical of the spoken Malayalam upstate”, Nair used to smirk. “Worse is their breaking of words and prolonging consonants in the name of proficiency. Too much intrusion by the chenda and maddalam spoils the percussion too.”  Nair worked at Kalamandalam for a brief period. The prestigious institution near Shoranur, 200 km north of his native place in Pathanamthitta district, employed him in 1979. Within a year, he felt scholastic requirements smothering his freelancing potential, and the vocalist quit to eventually find a fairly regular venue back at Tiruvalla, which has its sprawling Vishnu shrine with night-long Kathakali as a big-ticket offering. “However, eight years passed before Nair steadied on stage after quitting his job,” recalls aesthete P. Ravindranath. “He had to overcome sustained snubs from colleagues and organisers amid exacerbated personal issues.” Nair’s chequered career in music was preceded by a shift within the domain. As a pre-teenager from a family with cultural lineage, he began as a Kathakali actor. Learning under a local guru, he debuted at age 10. Soon elders noticed his singing talent, and took him to vocalist Tiruvalla Chellappan Pillai — the last disciple of iconic Iravankara Neelakantan Unnithan (1885-1957). Travancore’s senior musicians Cherthala Kuttappa Kurup, Thankappa Panikkar and Thakazhi Kuttan Pillai went on to inspire Nair, who was 14 when he debuted as a Kathakali vocalist. “Unlike the northerners, we weren’t finicky about teamwork,” regretted Nair. “Bad casting and undue compromises diluted southern Kathakali music.” Such outspokenness invited displeasure from masters, notes aficionado Evoor Mohandas. Adds researcher Sajaneev Ithithanam, “His utterances were so clear that when Nair sang over radio I used to note down the literature (for reference).” Nair, who wrote a Kathakali story titled ‘Chakkulathamma Charitam’ (2019), won the Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Akademi’s Gurupuja, among other honours. The writer is a keen follower of Kerala’s performing arts.",Sreevalsan Thiyyadi,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/tribute-to-kathakali-musician-tiruvalla-gopikuttan-nair/article65182956.ece
1008,"March 18, 2022",18:02 IST,entertainment,music,"Suchismita Das on ‘Damaru’, instant musicians and more"," For Suchismita Das who has been a Hindustani classical singer for two decades, her new song ‘Damaru’ which is a mix of Hindustani classical, rap and bass, is refreshingly new. Released on Shivaratri, this song was produced by Grammy Award-winning music composer Ricky Kej. The track, also featuring Mohini Dey on guitar, and London-based rapper Maya Miko, describes the glory of Lord Shiva.  With a beautiful landscape in the background of the video, Damaru is Suchismita’s latest composition.  Originally based out of Kolkata, she now shuttles between Mumbai and Los Angeles. Having dabbled with jazz, ghazals, fusion and pop, Suchismita feels she truly belongs with music regardless of the genre. Having worked with AR Rahman, Shankar Mahadevan, Preetam, Javed Akhtar, and Thomas Newman ( The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel and its sequel), Suchismita, who has been learning music since she was four, feels music is her breathing space. “I would love to work more on this semi-classical genre ‘Thumri’” she says, speaking from LA, in a video interview with The Hindu. Some excerpts How did ‘Damaru’ originate? I’m an ardent follower of Lord Shiva and I wanted to compose a song which reflected this devotion. When I started working on the song in 2019, Ricky produced it partially and sent it to me. The beats were beautiful. As I listened to it, I realised the song exuded high levels of energy and infusing rap into it made sense. That is how ‘Damaru’ came into being.  How is the Hollywood music industry different from the Hindi film industry? They have a plan, and they execute it. It is very streamlined. The Hindi film industry is improving on that front, but still has a long way to go. Many new musicians do not learn classical music anymore. Is it a problem of accessibility? If you have a foundation in classical music, you can adapt to other genres easily. I feel training in classical music is necessary to become a good musician. Accessibility also plays a role, but I feel it is more to do with interest. People are not too keen to learn classical music anymore. Are reality shows just a platform to get recognition or do they help launch one’s career? When you are in a show, you get to sing a lot of songs, and people know who you are. The question is what artists do after the show because the challenge starts when the person is in the real world. We have seen both — people from reality shows who have made it big in the Hindi film industry and those who have not.  Do reels, Tik Tok and other social media hinder the growth of music? Social media has taken over everything. On one hand, social media helps reach more people, on the other, it has made a musician out of everybody and that is a little disturbing. The idea of somebody becoming a musician in 30 seconds is frightening.  ‘Damaru’ can be viewed here.

1009,"March 17, 2022",19:30 IST,entertainment,music,Classical treat by Kalapini and Bhuvanesh Komkali," The Raza Foundation held a jugalbandi concert recently that was remarkable for a variety of reasons. For one, it signalled the return of live performances in Delhi; the hall was filled to 50 per cent capacity, a rare phenomenon in a city known for its blasé audiences for classical music. Secondly, it featured the aunt-nephew duo of Kalapini and Bhuvanesh Komkali. Such a pairing is unique, since the different singing scales pose a hurdle not easy to surmount. As Bhuvanesh said in a lighter vein, “Humne gaane ke liye madhya marg chunni, aakhir hain to Madhya Pradesh ke” (we chose the madhya or middle scale, after all we belong to Madhya Pradesh). And thirdly, the concert was devoted to their guru Pt. Kumar Gandharva’s compositions.  The hour-long presentation, however, was not all great music. Singing in an unfamiliar scale seemed inhibiting, especially for Kalapini, who was not able to present her voice at its best. The harmonium accompaniment by Chetan Nigam seemed lacklustre and uninspired at times, though Shambhunath Bhattacharya was his usual ebullient self. Playing on different pitched right-hand tablas (for each singer ) and changing and retuning them during the concert did not seem to pose a hurdle at all for him. The duo began with a mangalacharan in raag Kedara. The calming piece set the tone for the concert; being in a pitch more suited to Bhuvanesh’s scale, it was dominated by him, with very brief interspersions by Kalapini. Next, Bhuvanesh sang a Tulsidas composition, based on raag Bahar. Kalapini’s solo was a magnificent Gaur Malhar composition by Surdas that described the birth of Krishna.  The lilting Holi ‘Narmada rang se bhari, holi khelega Krishna Murari’, sung by both in raag Kafi, is a folk song of the Malwa region. Apparently, the celebrated artist Sayed Haider Raza (the concert was organised to mark the painter’s birth centenary) used to love the Narmada; the allusion to the word ‘rang’ was appropriate too. Though Bhuvanesh excelled, singing in both upper and lower registers, the piece was led by Kalapini. The next piece, a solo by Bhuvanesh, was a composition by Kabir, ‘Neherwa humka naa bhave’, and was rendered with poignancy. His next was a small folk bhajan. Kalapini then sang another solo piece, a rare composition by Chandrasakhi, ‘Milta ja jo’. Her next song on guru bhakti, with which the concert was to end, was the one that Kalapini said she had once sung for Raza sahib. On audience request, the duo ended with what’s arguably the song most identified with Kumar Gandharva, ‘Kaun thagawa nagareeya lootan ho’ in raag Kalyan. The concert was a reminder of the creative genius of both Kumar Gandharva and Raza. The Delhi-based author writes on classical music and musicians.",Shailaja Khanna,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/classical-treat-by-kalapani-and-bhuvanesh-komkali/article65234113.ece
1010,"March 17, 2022",16:39 IST,entertainment,music,An ode to the gaanewalis," 
Indian history is rich with evidence of women performers — from Vedic times onwards. Many of them, proficient in music, dance and literature, became an integral part of the country’s cultural scene, their expertise earning them royal patronage. Referred to as ganika, tawaif, gaanewali, or baiji, they wielded much influence in royal courts. In turn, they trained young enthusiasts, who carried forward their artistic legacy, particularly their treasury of compositions.  The style of musical performance they followed was called ‘shabda-pradhan sangeet’, a format where focus was on the word. It was also called ‘Abhinayatmak Sangeet’, in tune with Natyashastra, where ‘abhinaya’ consists of four aspects — angika (body movements and gestures), vachika (words or text), aharya (costume and decor), and satvika (moods and emotions) Thus, well-known Hindustani singers such as Husna Bai, Malka Jan, Gauhar Jaan, Zohra Bai, Vidyadhari Bai, Rasoolan Bai, Siddheshwari Devi and Begum Akhtar were also trained in Kathak and abhinaya in their younger days.  Myriad musical forms The music favoured by these artistes was high in poetic content — such as thumri, dadra, chaiti, kajri and ghazals, which allowed for the display of emotions during performances. Though these forms are an intrinsic part of Hindustani music, expertise in them calls for the blend of a certain temperament and training.  Thumri is often followed by dadra, with a relatively faster tempo and set to the Dadra or Kaherwa taal. There is also a variation of dadra, where the refrain is elaborated with an Urdu couplet or a poem in a Hindi dialect like Brajbhasha or Purabi woven into it.  At a recent musical event titled ‘O Gaanewali’, held at NCPA in Mumbai, thumri singer Avanti Patel celebrated the music of the tawaifs. “We’ve watched movies that revolved around their life, but very few have focused on their art. I wanted to share this aspect with music lovers and learners. Along with a group of passionate musicians (vocalist Rutuja Lad, Dhyaneshwar Sonawane on the harmonium, Vanraj Shastri on the sarangi, and Akshay Jadhav on the tabla), I have been exploring the musical genre the tawaifs pursued, hoping to shed some light on how they pioneered an important movement in history by encouraging women to become professional performers.” The show was scripted by Avanti and directed by Mallika Singh and Meghana AT.  Interactive show Recalling her earlier experience of presenting the show online, Avanti says it looked more like a film. “But for the stage we made it interactive, with the musicians talking about the musical forms they presented, for instance what is Purab Ang or Bol Banaav ki Thumri or Dadra.”  The instrumentalists spoke about the nuances of accompaniment, the ‘saath-sangat’. Sarangi, which is said to resemble the human voice due to its ability to reproduce the bhaav of a composition, has been associated with thumri and its allied forms.  “The harmonium,” says Dhyaneshwar, disciple of Sudhir Nayak, “is like a vocalist’s companion.” Akshay explained the various styles of taals such as thekas and laggis and demonstrated how to play them on the tabla for thumri-dadra.  The show was diligent about the minutest details, such as the musicians opting for old-world costumes and jewellery, and the stage decorated with silk curtains, Persian carpet, chandeliers and gramophone, to recreate the feel of an era gone by.  Humming the popular dadra, ‘Qadar nahin jaani’, Avanti says, “This show is a way to express our gratitude to the gaanewalis, who never really got their due, yet contributed immensely to music.” The Delhi-based reviewer writes on classical music.",Manjari Sinha,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/an-ode-to-the-gaanewalis/article65234070.ece

Murals of instruments adorn the walls of most of the rooms. A wall facing the recording rooms has an illustration of the music legend himself, the art bustling with notes of music.  Inside, the 78-year-old musician is busy with last minute preparations for his upcoming concert: ‘Rock with Raaja,’ which will be the first big concert in the city after two years of the pandemic. “These last two years were a dark phase for many people,” says Ilaiyaraaja, popularly known as ‘Isaignani’ for his musical expertise. He adds, “Even during that time, my music was their companion. Now, it is a chance to give them an opportunity to experience the same in person... I believe this will give them hope for better times ahead.” Though he participated in thousands of concerts across the world, this one will be different, he promises. In a marked departure from his gentle melodies, this time he says he is focussing on “fun” — promos have him urging people to ‘dance to his songs’. “Yes, that’s a clue,” he smiles, “But I cannot elaborate on that.” While fans will miss singers like the late SP Balasubrahmanyam on stage, ‘Rock with Raaja’ could throw up a few surprises, with a line-up of singers that include names like Mano, Karthik, Shweta Mohan and Devi Sri Prasad, among others. ‘Where are the composers?’ The last few years have seen huge changes on the music front, with terms like ‘viral’ and ‘views’ becoming key indicators of success. Ilaiyaaraja, however, seems unfazed by social media’s metrics. “My music has been viral for four decades, hasn’t it,” he states, adding, “If a song is on people’s minds for just one week or so, how can you call it viral? There are no composers in the film industry today; there are only programmers. There are so many new singers and voices today, but does anything stand the test of time? With KJ Yesudas and SP Balasurahmanyam, that era is gone....” With more than a thousand films to his credit, Ilaiyaraaja has experimented with many musical genres. “There are only four-five situations in cinema. That’s why AR Rahman gave a statement once that he is bored of composing for films. The same themes of love, love failure, and one-sided love keep repeating itself. Today, even songs celebrating mothers and sisters are not being accepted by the audience. All this is because the numbers are being sung by singers whose vocals do not exactly match with the characters voicing it on the screen.”  Nevertheless, Ilaiyaraaja have a busy year ahead, with upcoming cinema projects by directors Vetrimaaran and Seenu Ramasamy, among others, lined up. He is also slated to be working on an Indo-English project titled A Beautiful Breakup, directed by Ajithvasan Uggina. “I’m someone who always encourages new talent,” he says, explaining why he has such a diverse range of projects. “When Mani Ratnam came to me, he was just starting out; I accepted him because I wanted to promote new people in the industry.” Music for courage A couple of months ago, a music enthusiast named Seethalakshmi famously sang her way through breast cancer surgery, crooning Ilaiyaraaja’s popular 1990 number ‘Karpoora Bommai Ondru’ ( Keladi Kanmani). Earlier, social media was also abuzz with stories of a baby who was unwell, but started recovering to strains of ‘Thiruvasagam’. Explaining why he thinks that this concert is important, after two very challenging years, Illaiyaraaja says, “Most of these songs are actually done for a situation in cinema, but I did not know that it had such power among listeners... Music can not only heal, but also hide the pain that you nurse in your everyday life.  Rock with Raaja is on March 18, from 6pm onwards, at Island Grounds.

But for Poly Varghese, one of a handful of players of the Mohan Veena, complete mastery over it has been a life purpose. Beginning his musical journey through mridangam at the Kerala Kalamandalam, Poly Varghese was inspired to take up the Mohan Veena, which combines Hawaiian guitar, sarod, sitar, sarangi and santoor, after watching a performance of Pandit Vishwa Mohan Bhatt, who created the instrument. However, the days since the COVID-19 outbreak have been hard for Poly Varghese. He was all set to relocate to the United States after receiving an offer to teach at a university there and collaborate with a few bands. But the pandemic put an end to the plans. Following a heart attack, the 51-year-old musician had to again cut down on his practice. His recent performance in Thiruvananthapuram was his first physical concert since the pandemic. ""After the U.S. plan was canceled, I shifted base from Chennai to a secluded house near the forests in Wayanad. For close to one-and-a-half years, I practised, made new compositions and performed in online concerts. But, when I sat down for my first physical concert, there was some fear, because after the angioplasty, I felt like a new person. The state of mind of the listeners too have changed now with the concern about the virus in the back of their minds. However, I managed to play for an extended period and it went well,"" says Poly Varghese. During the pandemic period, he collaborated with salsa musicians from Cuba, musicians from the Amazon forests and a group of Iranian and Moroccan musicians for a Moroccan radio station project. He is also working on his next album as well as a collaboration with tribal musicians of Wayanad. For Poly Varghese, the only model before him has always been his guru, Vishwa Mohan Bhatt, with whom he is regularly in touch. His first public performance came after more than 14 years of rigorous practice, with five of them at Bhatt's home in Rajasthan, in a gurukula setting. ""My guru comes from a North Indian musical culture. He can teach me the anatomy or the structure of a composition, but whatever I play after that, it is my own music, which is influenced by my own cultural understandings, political viewpoints and so on.. So, what I produce will be a spontaneous amalgamation of all these,"" says Mr. Varghese. Although Mohan Veena is very much a part of his life, Poly Varghese is against venerating any musical instrument and giving it an exalted status. ""In the Indian context especially, some kinds of instruments, especially those associated with classical music, are given an exalted status. We need to understand that it is just a medium or a machine we use to convey our feelings. We have to maintain it like we do a cutting plier, which should not rust to ensure it cuts effectively,"" says Poly Varghese.",S.R.

As the song progresses, the music gets as compelling as the lyrics, building gently with an eased deliberation. The teenage singer-songwriter’s depth and clarity of thought refuses to waver, as she weaves more details into the picture of two estranged lovers who are at completely different stages of breaking and healing. Released recently, Hurricane is Aira’s second single, after Golden Hour in 2021. Both tracks have been produced by Michael Timothy. A low, soft, pop number, Hurricane describes turmoil, numbness and quiet sentimentality with the same degree of matter-of-fact acceptance. To 18-year-old Aira, who has been writing songs since the age of 12, this track also represents a shift in her creative process: “Unlike my usual writing process, Hurricane is a song I have been putting together for months on end. Over the past year I have been constantly revisiting it, going back and forth before sitting down to record it. So when I finally sat down, I was very decisive about what I wanted to do with the track sonically and lyrically. I knew what I wanted it to embody.”  It helped, of course, that she was freed this time from all the doubts and anticipation that come with putting a song out for the very first time. This ease and clarity shines through in the final track, aided perhaps by the fact that the project is entirely Aira’s own. From the act of songwriting to shooting creative cover art, she has done everything by herself.  This has been intentional from the very beginning, from the days when “I used to write songs about the difficulties of being 12, and how hard school life is,” she recalls with a laugh, describing the numerous diaries she still has with her, filled with songs she penned years ago.  “Even then, when I had no real intention of putting my songs out there, I knew that in case I ever wanted to, it would have to be with my own music. I did not know that there was a concept of other people writing music for you. So, I did,” she says, simply. There is, however, one exception. Aira remembers the first song she ever wrote: “It was a song I had written with my best friend back in the day, in middle school. We wrote about how we were going to spend our summer vacations.” ‘Hurricane’ is streaming now on Spotify.",Meghna Majumdar,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/chennai-indie-artist-aira-latest-track-hurricane/article65092117.ece

Mahesh, who passed away on March 4, who introduced pre-recorded audio cassettes to South India.  Master Recording Company, popularly known as Sangeetha Live Audio Cassettes, released several albums, with the first being a set of devotional songs on Raghavendraswamy sung by Kannada singer-actor Rajkumar and penned by popular Kannada lyricist Chitnahalli Udayashankar. Rajkumar went on to record over 250 devotional songs for the company. “Those were not easy days for the music industry. We were not able to get distributors and would ask leading shops to stock cassettes,” recalls H.M. Krishna, Mahesh’s brother, who helped him manage the business. Eminent artistes including Mandolin U. Shrinivas and Chitravina N. Ravikiran, who were child artistes at that point of time, were introduced by the company.  “M. Balamuralikrishna, who recorded the most number of albums with us, used to call up to find out if the studio was free, and then come and record an album. His first release was on Utsava Sampradaya kritis, which was a major hit with listeners. His contract with HMV had ended a few months before he began recording with us,” recalls Krishna. Born in a village in Kasaragod district in Karnataka, Mahesh got hooked to music because of radio. He began singing in orchestras and moved from Bengaluru to Chennai to meet the film industry’s music directors. Much of the recording of southern film music then happened in this city.  It was at the insistence of lyricist Udayashankar that Mahesh joined the Kannada section of Saraswathi Stores run by AVM. He took it upon himself to improve the collection of Kannada songs. As part of his job, he came in touch with many film personalities and musicians. In 1978-79, he realised that many music shop owners were copying North Indian film and classical music from LP records to audio tapes. He wanted this to be done in a legal manner, and was convinced that cassettes were the future. He resigned from AVM and started Master Recording company, and became the first licensed manufacturer of pre-recorded cassettes in South India.  For over 30 years, cassettes held sway. Mahesh’s company was responsible for some of the finest recordings, especially of classical music. With the digital era, Sangeetha Cassettes too switched to the new format.  Mahesh has left behind a rich legacy of recordings featuring greats such as S.P.B; S. Janaki, M. Balamuralikrishna, D.K. Jayaraman, Swami Haridhos Giri, and the Bombay Sisters. ",Deepa H.

Nirmala Nagaraj, who has been writing poems from her student days, chose a few poems from her collection and conceived ‘Ashthanayakan’, a performance that featured eight male dancers that was held at Kalakshetra.  “I composed a padam, ‘Magizh Maaran’, in 2016. It showed the reaction of a man to a swadeenapatika (one who experiences the pleasure of love) nayika. The positive response of senior gurus and my contemporaries and students to this song, encouraged me to compose a few more,” says Nirmala Nagarajan, who attributes the idea also to her Phd on Sangam literature, which has songs on men.  Young and talented musician, Abhilash Venkitachalam, has composed the music for the padams chosen for ‘Ashtanayakan’.  'Vazhi meedu vizhi vaittu kattruppen' says the hero, Haripadman, in his teens, who is awaiting the arrival of his beloved. The dancer explores the simple joys of holding her hands and playing with her. The scene that shows him feeling embarrased when he encounters a group of giggling friends stood out for the way Haripadman shrinks his broad shoulder.  ‘She stole my heart and left me pining for her’ is the essence of the composition, ‘Viraha thuyar naathan’. A. Janardhanan’s delineation of shringaram laced with the ‘vedanai’ of separation was a dignified and masterly portrayal. Happy memories and the pathos of separation with imageries of a bright moon, cool breeze and Manmatha’s arrows come alive in a poetic manner, aided by the use of Abheri raga. The veteran dancer conveyed the emotions through his body language and facial expressions.  Vasantha was the raga chosen to express the anger felt by ‘Vanchina maraimuga vaanan’ danced by P.T. Narendra. Born out of experiencing deceit in love, the dancer portrayed the feeling sensitively. He used many suitable sancharis.  V.P. Dhananjayan was the hero of ‘Senjina vaanan’ set to raga Mohanam. His expressive eyes conveyed the intense love that he feels for the nayika that turns into anger when he reads the letter sent by her. ‘Podum aval poi mozhigal’, he says, remembering the moments of their intimacy. The detailed depiction of the beautiful tresses that he held, combed and braided was a masterclass in abhinaya. In ‘Kalaga thuyar naathan’, Sheejith Krishna is remorseful after venting his anger. He seeks forgiveness and wants to be free of negative emotions. His abhinaya beautifully blended with the strains of Charukesi raga. The breaking of a glass in anger and then piecing it together, perfectly conveyed the nayaka’s state of mind.  The anxiety experienced while waiting for the nayika was what Shijith Nambiar expressed as ‘Porumai iyanthuyal naathan’. Using sancharis of bee and flower and body and breath, he speaks of being inseparable in love. The thought was conveyed through swaras of raga Kalyanavasantham.  There is no place for dishonesty and ego in a relationship. G. Narendra as ‘Agam kalaindhaalan’ made this very clear. The dancer amazingly transforms from a man, who stands in front of a mirror and takes pride in the way he looks, to one who yearns for a warm embrace from his beloved.  The portrayal of varied emotions has to culminate in the blissful union, where two bodies embody one soul. He is ‘Maghizh maaran’. The hero weilds the sword and his eyes are as bright as the sun, but when he meets his beloved becomes calm and as gentle as the veena. The shy heroine is like the moon that hides behind the clouds. Young Kali Veerapathiran conveyed this joy through his dance.  Abhilash Venkitachalam, grandson of musician and musicologist T.K. Govinda Rao, set the compositions to tune. “I used ragas that suited the emotions in each poem. Though the choice of Mohanam, a soothing raga, to convey anger was unusual. I had discussions with each artiste after they choreographed the poems to accomodate their ideas and make suitable changes in the music. It was an extremely satisfying exercise.”  Linking the theme together were young artistes, Rajkamal and Gopika Raj Pillai, who played well the role of sutradhaars. The show anchored by Aparna had nattuvangam, was by Jyolsana Menon. The musical team consisted of Deepu Nair on vocal support, Shashidar on the flute, Anantha Narayanan on the veena, Jagdeesh Janardhanan on the mridangam and Krishnendu on the tambura.

1016,"March 10, 2022",18:48 IST,entertainment,music,"Gangubai Hangal: That strong, unique voice"," Gangubai Hangal, who would have turned 110 on March 5, was a sparkling facet of the Kirana gharana Gangubai hardly looked or behaved like the diva that she was. Her articulation was uncluttered and more often pointed to something very profound. In an interview, she once said: “Music is an art for the listener and the performer. Once the boundaries of the physical are crossed by the artiste and the audience, there remains no difference between them — the passage of experience will be the same for both.” She continued: “To relish Hindustani music, there is no need to be knowledgeable about the musical form. What you need is a good heart and a sharp mind. Both of these belong to the experiential realm. Knowledge at times helps, but also disturbs. I have seen enlightened audiences carrying out dry discussions on the subtleties of a raga or a form. But for an intuitive listener, the experience can be far deeper.”  Gangubai’s words echo the words of eminent musicologist Sheila Dhar in her essay: ‘The Raga: An Inward Journey’. The central object of a classical musician’s labour, she says, is not the cultivation of a beautiful tone, but the development of an almost limitless capability in articulation.  Thus, for the initiated listener, truth lies in the experience and not the beauty of voice. For Gangubai, music was her purpose, the voice was a mere medium — of this she was never in doubt. Nevertheless, her voice did become the focus of discussions and continues to remain so.  Most critics who wrote about Gangubai’s music could hardly resist the temptation of making a comment about her voice. Contemporary and younger generation musicians succumbed to this enticement as well; not surprising, considering the resounding power that her voice exuded. But what they all universally agreed to was the purity of her music. “Her voice is strong, not syrupy. It does not appeal to sweetness at all,” senior critic Raghava Menon wrote in his book,  Indian Music. He compared her baritone timbre to the church bell — strong and chaste, resonant and carrying. Eventually, what emerged from her music was a noble passion and supreme strength of character. And voice did become, at the end of the recital, a trivial issue for the listener as well. Significance of shadja Gangubai’s voice was not the kind that soared three octaves effortlessly; however, between the lower shadja and the upper shadja, she painted a picture of totality. Interestingly, a lot has been written and said about how musicians treat their shadja. The character and temperament of their music is largely determined by their treatment of this fixed (sthayi) note. Abdul Karim Khan’s shadja had a mesmeric quality; Bhimsen Joshi’s shadja bore resemblance to Kesarbai Kerkar’s shadja of bold and emotive resonances.  True to the Kirana stamp, Gangubai was also a pursuer of the ‘sur’. For her, tradition was of immense value. She would say, “It is the labour of one who teaches and the one who learns.” When the air of change and novelty was blowing across the country, it was only Gangubai and Hirabai Barodekar who dared to stand up for convention. Tradition, for Gangubai (or Hirabai), was not conservatism, but a deep reverence for the knowledge that was passed on by the guru, a belief that it was complete. New depths had to be found within the framework of tradition itself.  Faith in the guru and her art was above everything else for Gangubai, hence she never had to battle with the effects of increasing commercialisation of music. Her music and her persona were never two different things: one was always the extension of the other.  Like her guru, she had a voice that was not very compliant: the initial minutes of a performance were always a raging battle between body and spirit, but she was not one to be cowed down. She battled with it out in the open, for all to see. The rugged masculinity of her voice is a stunning metaphor of her life and music entrenched in hardships. A Bhairav rendition at the Sawai Gandharva Festival, Pune, perhaps in the 90s, just refused to take flight. A voice that had gone as stiff as starch and an imagination that simply refused to find a language left her rendition dry and listless. But Gangubai held on for a good 50 minutes, trying to coax it with her solid faith, and what followed was a moving Hindol.  Emphasis on melody The Abdul Karim Khan school of the Kirana Gharana emphasised more on melody and less on rhythm. In the true spirit of the founder of the gharana, Sawai Gandharva and all his students — Bhimsen Joshi, Gangubai Hangal and Firoze Dastur — sang with their soul. It became impossible for any musician of independent India to resist the charm of these musicians. Abdul Karim Khan saab never indulged in complicated taan patterns; instead, his alaap was long and contemplative.  But a close study of his lineage reveals that, except for Bhimsen Joshi and Roshan Ara Begum, no other practitioner of the gharana employed complex taan patterns. An old recording of Roshan Aara Begum’s rendition of Jaunpuri is a case in point. Richly imaginative, her alaap is mellifluous; her boltaans and murkhis are sharp and nuanced. Roshan Aara’s inflections are Bhimsen Joshi’s too. The short, stunning rendition of Shuddh Kedar ‘Sawan ki boondaniyan’ captures the genius of Bhimsen Joshi completely. His long, breathtaking taans are replete with complex combinations of swaras. If the former’s rendition is torrential, the latter’s is serene. Yet, both deep and both touching.  A quintessential practitioner of the Kirana was perhaps Gangubai. Her music was austere and ascetic. She adhered to the gharana tradition marked by a slow tempo and the gradual unfolding of the ragas.  Musical possibilities  Each note was a melodic idea, and was elongated in a manner that evoked tranquility. This is perhaps why the treatment of the shadja is so crucial to the Kirana practitioners. It seems as if the spirit of the musician merges with the spirit of the note.  Even when one is a strong adherent of tradition, it is rare that a student is a carbon copy of her guru. The guru’s thoughts and ideas pass through the student’s creative process and synthesise into an independent creation. So, even as the gharana tradition remains inviolate, new musical possibilities integrate with each new artiste.  One can observe these features in ragas that are sung by the Kirana practitioners. Take, for instance, Shuddh Kalyan. Gangubai carves exquisite glides as she descends into the mandra through the notes ‘sa’ and ‘dha’ while rendering the raag. Even Pooriya Dhanashree, her repeated enunciation of the swara cluster ‘ni, rie, ga, ma – ma, pa – dha, pa – ma, ga, rie, sa’ for the celebrated bandish ‘Ab to rutuman’ scales new emotional heights each time. When Gangubai engaged in repetition, she lent extraordinary force and intensity. Her renditions with long meend phrases and extraordinary taans had a sustained tension. Her singing neither had the magnificence of Sawai Gandharva nor the brilliance of Bhimsen Joshi, yet it had a distinct spiritual edge. Gangubai carved out a style of her own.

1017,"March 10, 2022",14:53 IST,entertainment,music,Musician Fejo: Good times are ahead for Malayalam rap,"  Malayalam rapper Fejo has a lot to cheer about post the release of Aashiq Abu’s Naradan. The Tovino Thomas-Anna Ben-starrer, a powerful critique on news channels, has not only given him a significant role but also features his song, ‘Thannatthan’.  “The film has another rap track, ‘Neeyetha’, by rappers MC Couper and Marthyan. Perhaps for the first time in Malayalam cinema, instead of ‘lyricists’, ‘rappers’ figure in the movie credits. Things have been looking up for Malayalam rappers in the last few years and this movie has come as a shot in the arm for us,” says Fejo. He plays Mudiyan, a rapper, in the film. The character is pitted against Tovino’s character, Chandraprakash, the high profile and cut-throat news anchor. “Sharing the screen with Tovi chettan, Anna, Indrans sir and others in my debut movie was not something I had expected. It has been a rewarding and memorable experience,” says Fejo, who started his career as a rap artiste over a decade ago.  He had met Aashiq during ‘Para’, a digital hip-hop festival featuring leading rap artistes from Kerala that was held last year. The show was directed by Aashiq and curated by actor-DJ Sekhar Menon and actor-musician Sreenath Bhasi. “Aashiq chettan had appreciated my songs then. But I was taken aback when I got a call from him saying that I had a role in his movie and that I would be doing a song as well. That was a bonanza!” he laughs.  Fejo adds that he was apprehensive after he did the screen test for the role. “I have faced the camera only for my music videos. So I was not sure if I had done enough to clear the audition. Even after I came on board, I had little idea about the character. So, I got a pleasant surprise when I realised that I had such an important role!” He adds that having Sekhar who understands the rap/hip-hop culture as the composer of Naradan helped while making the song. “I have been doing fast-paced songs. However, the director and composer told me that even though ‘Thannatthan’ has rap elements it should be a groovy track, keeping in with the pace of the movie. Sekhar chettan set it in such a way that I could give exactly what he wanted for the track,” he explains.  Fejo mentions that even though he has no combination scenes with MC Couper and Marthayan in the movie, he was there on the set when their video was shot. The director has tried to change the misconception that rappers are into drugs and lead a wayward lifestyle,” he adds.  Fejo is fresh from the success of Mohanlal’s Arattu in which he has sung the theme song (‘Thalayude vilayattu’) with MG Sreekumar. Composed by Rahul Raj, the song was on the trending list. “Using a rap song for big stars is not new in Malayalam cinema. The trend, however, is to use Tamil lyrics as in the case of Lucifer (‘Kadavule pole’) or English as in Mammootty’s Abrahaminte Santhathikal. Rahul chettan said that we would give it a try with Malayalam lyrics,” says Fejo. Fejo’s debut in films was with Maradona for Sushin Shyam and he has done the most number of songs for Jakes Bejoy ( Ranam, Kalki and Operation Java). His other film projects are Athiran, Jeem Boom Bhaa, Under World, and Uriyadi.  “The acceptance from the film industry has to do with how much the audience appreciate our work. The best thing about working in films is that I have been able to experiment with the rap genre and thereby give something new for listeners,” he adds.  Fejo avers that it is important for each rapper to have his or her own style. Meanwhile, he is hopeful about good times ahead for Malayalam rap. “It is true that we have to go a long way when compared to the scene in Tamil or Hindi. However, there is more acceptance for rap in the new generation and Malayalam rap will go places in the next five or six years. By that time we might get support from more music labels,” he signs off.",Athira M,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/rapper-fejo-acting-debut-naradan-and-malayalam-rappers/article65210395.ece
1018,"March 10, 2022",14:24 IST,entertainment,music,‘They are incredibly humble’: Coimbatore’s Aditya Veera on interviewing award-winning musicians," The name of Aditya Veera’s band, Thayirsadam Blues, somewhat belies his taste in music. There is nothing Thayirsadam (curd rice) about it. He grew up listening to Harry Belafonte with his grandfather, who had worked at Harvard and MIT. His father, he says, was into jazz, blues, funk, and rock. When he was doing his pre-university course in Bengaluru, he was into heavy metal.  Why Thayirsdam then? “We were three individual musicians who were participating in an open mic for fun. The emcee there put us on the spot. He asked us for a band name,” Adiya recalls this memory from his college years, “So, we got into a huddle and tried to figure out what’s common for us. And, we realised we were all Tamilians who loved curd rice. But one of us was a sax player who was into blues music.” Hence, Thayirsadam Blues. The band, born in Pune, did over 200 shows, was featured in radio shows among other platforms. It moved to Bengaluru when Aditya moved there after college in 2018. Apart from his band, he also started managing other independent musicians. All this alongside his day job as a software architect. When the pandemic hit, he returned to his hometown, Coimbatore. He did a few online shows with his band and a COVID fundraiser featuring some popular musicians like Usha Uthup and Lydian Nadhaswaram. Then, sometime towards the end of 2020, he came up with a new idea for a talk show. “I wanted to connect with music industry professionals from different parts of the world to get their ideas that would benefit Indian independent artists.”  And, the people he had in mind were not just any music professionals. They were award-winning artists and producers, who have worked with the legends of western music. The list included Grammy-winning musicians like Erick Walls and Lee Ritenour; American guitarist Robben Ford, who has worked with KISS, Miles Davis, Chick Corea among others; Sheryl Bailey, who is the assistant chair of the guitar department at the Berklee College of Music. A post shared by Aditya Veera (@adix70) The interviews are published on Aditya’s instagram page, which has just over 1,800 followers. How did these big names agree to talk to him? “They are all super grounded,” replies Aditya, “It’s so easy to communicate with them. They carry no airs of winning Grammy Awards or whatever recognition they have. So when I asked some of them questions like, ‘What do you want to be remembered as?’ They tell me ‘I want to be known as a good person.’” However, Aditya had no means of contacting them directly. So, he had to reach them via their record studios or agents. He explains the process, “I just Google to check who manages this person. Say, it’s Universal Records. Then, I check who is the best person to talk to in Universal Records. Then, I shoot out a mail with my portfolio to them. If they’re interested, they’ll get back. They’d have a couple of interviews to make sure that this is legitimate. And then, we take it forward.” “You need a lot of patience. Some of them might take weeks to respond. But once they respond, it is a smooth and simple process,” he adds. Aditya’s Instagram interviews are now being broadcasted via Big FM Aizawl. A podcast is in the pipeline too. In his own way, he is doing to aspiring Indian musicians what his grandfather did to him as a kid: bringing world music home.   ",Praveen Sudevan,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/aditya-veera-interview-podcast-grammy-music/article65210189.ece

1020,"March 09, 2022",15:01 IST,entertainment,music,"Meet Bengaluru’s Ranjani Ramadoss: Vocalist, keyboardist, and a teacher"," Ranjani Ramadoss, who goes by the moniker RANJ, was born in 1998, a time when the country, especially her hometown, Chennai, was experiencing what she calls the ‘Rahman fever’. In 1992, AR Rahman had blown everyone away with a sensational debut album, Roja. He then followed it up with one chartbuster after another. By 1998, a boy from Chennai was already on his way to the pantheon of Indian film music. The budding musicians of the city had one of their own to look upto. Ranjani was one of them When she was four, her music-enthusiast parents had put her in a singing class. These classes made her feel like she found her natural habitat. “Music was the most exciting thing in the world for me.” Despite her Carnatic music upbringing and the constant kutcheri visits with her father, Ranjani wanted to emulate Rahman. “I did not want to make music for films. I just liked the way he produced music — it had an electronic influence but also cool sonic ideas. I wanted to do that. I also wanted to write my own lyrics,” she explains. After her ninth grade, she joined a part-time course in Rahman’s KM Music Conservatory, where she learnt opera. “I learnt about how a studio setup works, how musicians jam and little things like that,” she adds. Ranjani also got a chance to perform in front of Rahman. A post shared by RANJ (@ranjaniramadoss) Five years ago, she decided to move to Bengaluru to be independent. She enrolled herself in a triple major course – Music, Psychology, and English – at Christ University. Life in Bengaluru as an independent girl was exciting. Establishing herself as an independent musician was challenging.    “I guess the big challenge is always money, whatever kind of independent musician you are, you’re not going to be making money in the initial stage. And, you need money to invest in your music so that people can hear it. So, a lot of musicians are forced to take up jobs they don’t like. And, music slowly takes a back seat in their life.” Ranjani had two part-time jobs to support her music. Thankfully, one of them, which she continues, is something she loves: teaching music. “Music changed everything for me. I used to feel worthless at school when I wasn’t doing well in studies. With music, I felt like there’s some purpose in life. So, when I see and talk to young people who have this natural love for music, it feels good.”  Her job, instead of hampering her music, is inspiring it in a way. “It is not easy being an independent artist in India,” she says, “Independent music is niche and not accessible to everyone. Your audience is just the English-speaking ones on social media. So, you are not really considered a legit entertainer or artist unless you have worked in films because cinema is the most widespread platform in India.” The last two years have been good for Ranjani. She had the opportunity to collaborate with other artists. She is a part of the indie bands, Kelvikkuri and Paula and the Associates. Her solo projects received acclaim. Last month, she was conferred the Toto Award for Music, whose former recipients include Prateek Kuhad among others.  “It’s a prestigious award because it’s chosen on merit and not on the basis of numbers. It’s a very nice gesture to support and nurture independent artists.”  This year, she intends to carry on her collaborations, make more music, and, with the pandemic easing out, perform more live shows. “Putting out your music on social media is good. The scary thing is, it’s not tangible — so, if something ever happens to it, what then? Which is why I am grateful to be able to do live shows and meet people. Once people have seen you in person, the connection is different.”",Praveen Sudevan,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/ranjani-ramadoss-ar-rahman-tfa-awards/article65204109.ece
1021,"March 04, 2022",12:31 IST,entertainment,music,Stories from Srivilliputhur," India’s temples are living receptacles of legend and history, art and architecture, tradition and heritage, beauty and pageantry. They have long been the centres of religious as well as social life, binding individuals and communities in a collective consciousness. In the absence of proper documentation, information about these ancient structures is mostly scarce, except for those thin booklets published for tourists and devotees.  In this light, historian-scholar Chithra Madhavan’s book, The Splendours of Srivilliputtur (Universal Publishing) is significant.  Published in English and Tamil, it has articles by scholars and experts that focus on various aspects of this temple. Chithra’s essays on the legends, festivals and architecture of the temple of Andal and Vatapathrasayee, and on the Vaidyanatha Swamy temple in the adjacent village of Madavar Vilagam are interesting accounts.  Prema Nandakumar, multilingual scholar and expert on Vaishnavism, explores Andal as an incarnation, as one of the Azhwars, who propagated the Bhakti Movement in Tamil Nadu, and has selections from her and her father Periyaazhwar’s immortal poetry. The chapter on Andal’s wedding, written by Prema, refers to the epic poem, Amukta Malyada, in Telugu, composed by emperor Krishnadevaraya of the Vijayanagara kingdom; and to Nachaaru Parinayam, another poetic work in Telugu, composed for Yakshagana by a group of writers from Rajapalayam. She also talks about Araiyar Sevai, the singing of the pasurams (hymns) with abhinaya by male members of the families that are hereditary performers of this ritual, and highlights its artistic aspects and history. G. Sankaranarayanan, also a multilingual scholar, writes on the inscriptions in the temple, dating to the 10th century. The Chola inscription mentions the name of the village as Vikrama Chola Chaturvedimangalam. Details of endowments by Pandya and Chera kings and the Nayak rulers to the temples of Sudikkoduththa Nachiar, Vadaperunkovil Swamigal, and Periyazhwar are mentioned. Historian V. Sriram writes on the compositions on Andal and finds only a few over the centuries, among them are ‘Choodi koodi nacchari’ by Tallapakka Annamacharya and songs on Andal by the 20th century composer Ambujam Krishna. The courtesan Muddupalani of Thanjavur had translated Andal’s Thiruppavai into Telugu in the 18th century. Ariyakkudi Ramanuja Iyengar was asked by Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswathi, 68th head of Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Pitam, to set the Thiruppavai to music and he sang them all at the temple in 1952. Sriram also writes about the Shiva temple at Madavar Vilagam. Asha Krishnakumar’s article is about the parrot that Andal holds in her hand and how it is made afresh every day with leaves, banana fibre, and the skin of pomegranate by the same family over the years. She explores the bird’s symbolism, the legends associated with it, and its spiritual significance.  The prasadam, special to each temple and the recipe handed down through generations, ensures no visitor goes hungry. Rakesh Raghunathan gives a list of the prasadams offered daily and those prepared on festival days at the Srivilliputhur temple.  The impeccable translation in Tamil has been done by S. Kannan Gopalan. The excellent photographs are definitely a highlight of the book. The beautiful paintings by the legendary S. Rajam and a charming portrait of Andal as a little girl by Keshav add artistic value to the book. The Chennai-based writer is a music and dance scholar.",Sujatha Vijayaraghavan,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/stories-from-srivilliputhur/article65187029.ece
1022,"March 03, 2022",17:56 IST,entertainment,music,Purandaradasa’s song for Shivaratri," On the just-concluded Mahashivaratri recently, the thought whether there are question came up as to whether any Carnatic composition that specifically mentions the festival, came to my mind. It led me on a search and I finally found one by Purandaradasa. There are plenty of songs on Shiva, I but searching for any specific reference to Maha Sivaratri is a tough task. However, there is one, by Purandara Dasa.On Shivaratri, which was celebrated earlier this week, I wondered if there were any Carnatic compositions that specifically mention the festival. It led me on a search and I finally found one by Purandaradasa.  The song, ‘Shiva darusana namagaayitu’ is mentioned in the Sri Purandara Mani Malai by Madras Lalithangi and M.L. Vasanthakumari, set in raga Madhyamavati, and tala Adi (page 100 of the 1955 edition). It is one of the rare compositions by Purandaradasa that is set on Shiva and not Vishnu. Perhaps anticipating such comments, the composer included an admonition at the end, which I will reveal later.  For the record, there are other compositions on Shiva by Purandaradasa. ‘Chandrachooda Shiva Sankara’ is on Kumbeswarar of Kumbakonam, and has been sung by M.L. Vasanthakumari as a ragamalika — Sankarabharanam, Hamsanandi, Thodi and Khamas. The last charanam, which identifies the kshetram, is set in all four ragas in reverse order. ‘Karunanidhiye eesa’ is on Tiruvannamalai and has gained traction in recent times with a tune in Kurinji by R.K. Shriramkumar. ‘Shiva darusana namagaayitu’ is structured as a set of devotees going to the temple of Mallikarjunaswami in Srisailam. The composer lived at a time when the Vijayanagar empire was at its zenith. Much expansion and construction happened at this shrine and it became a popular place for pilgrimage. King Krishnadevaraya visited it immediately after his victory over the Gajapatis and made huge grants to the temple. The shrine, being a Padal Petra Sthalam, is much older. In Adi Sankara’s Sivanandalahari, Shiva at this shrine is compared to a jasmine that blooms in the evening. Being one of the 12 jyotirlingas, it also finds mention in Adi Sankara’s Dvadasa Linga Stuti. For 12th century poet Akka Mahadevi, Mallikarjuna was her spiritual ideal.  The temple celebrates a ten-day Brahmotsavam during Mahashivaratri, when the wedding of Shiva and Parvati is celebrated on the seventh evening. The song’s pallavi is about getting a darshan of Shiva on Shivaratri. Purandaradasa uses the word jaagarane — meaning remaining awake — which is part of the celebration of this festival. The anupallavi is more specific on the kshetra: “Having bathed in the sin-destroying Patalaganga, we saw the jyotirlinga and got rid of our daily concerns.” Srisailam is located on the banks of the river Krishna, which at this spot is known as Patalaganga. Thus, by combining the reference to Jyotirlinga and Patalaganga, Purandaradasa makes it clear that the song refers to the Srisailam temple. The charanam is most interesting, as it has what scholar Dr. V. Raghavan would have referred to as a ‘knot’ — it states that Shiva looks at Saraswati and dances in joy on Nandi. The line in the book refers to Brahmana Rani (or Brahma’s queen, Saraswati). But this is clearly either a misprint or an error that’s come down over the ages. The goddess at Srisailam is called Bhramaramba. She is also referred to as Bhramara Rani — the queen of the bees. Having eight arms, legend has it that the goddess took on the form of a bee to kill a demon who could not be vanquished by any two or four-armed being. The line clearly meant Bhramara Rani, which over time became Brahmana Rani. On Mahashivaratri day, just before the wedding, Shiva here is taken around on the Nandi vahana exactly as Purandaradasa describes it. In addition, Mahashivaratri is also associated with the Shiva tandava, which he performs in the presence of the goddess. This song by Purandaradasa is not often heard, and I would have never known of it had it not been for my mentor and friend, the late S. Rajam. He had learnt the composition directly from Madras Lalithangi and had also sketched its theme in one of his famed musical notebooks. And now for the admonition — The song ends with the words ‘I saw the Lord on the hill even as I meditated on Purandara Vittala, who is Hari Narayana’. To enlightened souls such as Purandaradasa, such differences in form were immaterial.

1023,"March 03, 2022",17:38 IST,entertainment,music,A book of Lalgudi’s compositions," Lalgudi Jayaraman was not just a celebrated violinist but also a vaggeyakara. After Veena Seshanna, he was probably the only prolific instrumental performer who also actively composed. Jayaraman’s pieces were widely performed in his own lifetime by stalwart contemporaries including Nedunuri Krishnamurthy, D.K. Jayaraman, Voleti Venkateswarlu, and M.L. Vasanthakumari. His compositions have been part of music and dance repertoires ever since. To highlight Jayaraman’s genius as a composer, his children, the violinists G.J.R. Krishnan and Vijayalakshmi, recently released a hardbound book of Jayaraman’s compositions, titled Lalgudi’s Creations, consolidating an earlier two-volume paperback. “This also includes many of our father’s later compositions and 15 of our grandfather V.R. Gopala Iyer’s songs,” says Krishnan. Multilingual scripts The lyrics in Tamil, Telugu and Sanskrit are presented in their respective scripts along with English transliteration. They include thillanas, tana varnams, pada varnams, kritis, jatiswarams and a pushpanjali. The Lalgudi bani is so rooted to faithful reproduction of the voice that all instrumental students have to learn to sing the compositions first before playing them. The intertwining of vocal proficiency and instrumental adroitness adds depth to the playing and is vividly reflected in Jayaraman’s compositions and their notations.  While the earlier books were facsimiles of handwritten lyrics, this Lalgudi 90 edition (commemorating Jayaraman’s 90th birth anniversary two years ago) is printed on thick paper, with notations in English, in Jayaraman’s bi-colour system — one for swaram (notes) and another for sahityam (lyrics). Unlike Western classical music, notating Carnatic music is no simple task due to the integral gamakams. Most available notations are either rudimentary or require laborious interpretation. Jayaraman’s notations, however, are comprehensive and logical, using intuitive diacritical marks to indicate the tiniest detail. Vocalist S.P. Ramh, Jayaraman’s senior student, skilfully notated many of the pieces, learning them on the spot as Jayaraman composed them. Jayaraman belongs to a small subset of lyricists who also set their compositions to tune. Observing his methodical documentation, one wonders if he honed these skills to pass on the bani without alteration and aid his numerous students. That he was an effective teacher is indisputable, borne out by accounts from his many protégés, who are reputed vocal and instrumental performers and teachers. Krishnan says his father derived inspiration from nature, from requests by artistes and laypeople, and by listening to other musicians. He converted his Nilambari tana varnam on goddess Saraswati, in Telugu, to a pada varnam in Tamil on Muruga, acceding to a request for a special composition for a young dancer’s arangetram. The thillana in Durga came after listening to Ajoy Chakrabarty’s rendition of that raga in Chennai, and from hearing Ilaiyaraaja’s Ragavardhini kriti. As to why Jayaraman never used a signature, his son says, “He felt that the musical style was distinctive enough.” Recorded renditions of the pieces would have made the book more useful and complete. A digital version, offering portability and instant access, would have helped make the works of this consummate musician accessible to younger people. Digital notation transcriptions are by Rangaswamy Venkataperumal and printing by A. S. Diwakar of Compuprint. The book is available at Saptaswara Musicals and Karnatic Music Book Centre.

1024,"March 03, 2022",17:11 IST,entertainment,music,Documentary on an unsung poet," A documentary that tells the story of the remarkable Tamil poet Vedanayagam Sastriar of Thanjavur will be released this weekend. The project is a labour of love undertaken by a descendant of the poet, who was inspired to do it when he heard a grandniece point to an image and ask, “Who is that man with the funny outfit?” It prompted Judah Vincent to read several biographies, develop a story board, identify production teams, hire a history consultant, and work with the State Archaeology Department so that he could bring the history of the poet to life. Born in Tirunelveli in 1774 and brought up along with the young prince Serfoji in Thanjavur by Fr. Schwarz, somewhere along the way Vedanayagam imbibed extraordinary skills in Tamil. He went on to become a prolific writer with more than 130 works to his credit, some of which are preserved in the finest libraries of the world. Vedanayagam demonstrated virtuosity in all aspects of Tamil literature — poetry, dance and drama. Besides, he had an encyclopaedic knowledge of the Bible, and mesmerised pundits with his Google-like references and recall of verses from both the old and new testaments. Under the tutelage of Fr. Schwartz and other missionaries, Vedanayagam became proficient in several subjects such as Geography, Botany, Physiology, Biology, Astronomy, Philosophy, and Sociology as well as Theology. All this knowledge was distilled into his works — Jebamalai, Bethalem Kuravanji, Drama of the Divine Carpenter, Thiru Sabhai Oonjal, Perinba Kaadal, to cite a few. When he was made a poet in Serfoji’s Maratha court, he refused to sing paeans to anyone but Jesus Christ. Among the several accolades that he received, the title of Sastriar or Doctor of Divinity stands out. It might surprise many people to learn that there is a statue of this arguably greatest Tamil Christian poet in New York. Thanks to word from missionaries, scholars across the world were quick to recognise the greatness of Vedanayagam Sastriar’s works. Several of them did comparative studies of Vedanayagam alongside Western poets such as Charles Wesley, Milton and Shakespeare. Vedanayagam, however, remained largely marginalised in his native land. And he, in turn, did not take any endowments from the king. In a milieu awash with Bavarian and Anglican hymns translated into Tamil with unchanged tunes, Vedanayagam was among the first to write Christian lyrics in Carnatic music style for worship in the traditional manner. This was soon recognised by Christian Literature Service and other publishers, with the result that Vedanayagam’s songs fairly dominate the lyric books used in Tamil churches across the globe. Only recently has a tentative attempt been initiated to digitise his enormous contribution to Tamil literature with a view to bringing to public knowledge the beauty hidden in palm leaves and other manuscripts languishing in sundry archive vaults. This effort could do with some administrative and material support and is probably more important than erecting statues or building arches to memorialise the unsung poet. An account of Vedanayagam, who was way ahead of his time in decrying the evils of casteism, superstition, and the suppression of women, is now being presented in a two-part documentary that will be available on YouTube shortly, in both Tamil and English.

1025,"March 03, 2022",12:31 IST,entertainment,music,A fresh start," Vaikom Vijayalakshmi likes new beginnings. She was born on October 7, 1981, but she usually refers to her birthday as being the day of ‘Vijayadasami’, a festival that is considered auspicious to start something afresh. After almost a decade of singing in the film industry, she has tried something new: croon for a TV serial. Her bold voice adorns the background score of Namma Madurai Sisters, a new serial currently airing in Colors Tamil. “We recorded it online, from Vaikom’s Gowri Studios,” says the visually-challenged singer, over a virtual conversation from her hometown in Kerala, “I liked the tune by Sidhu Kumar. It’s my first Tamil serial and the lyrics are about women-empowerment.” While Vijayalakshmi hails from Kerala, it was in Chennai, then Madras, that she first discovered her musical talent. “My father (Muraleedharan) had an electronic business in the city, so I was here till I turned five years old. It was a great phase, because I repeatedly kept listening to MSV and Ilaiyaraaja’s Tamil songs. I used to keep humming them.”  Back then, she devoured songs from the 1985 hit Sindhu Bhairavi (“I used to keep singing ‘Naan Oru Sindhu…”). After her family moved back to her hometown in Kerala, she devoted a lot of time to listening to cassettes of singer KJ Yesudas, MS Subbalakshmi and Balamuralikrishna. “Listening to these greats helped me embark on my musical journey.”  While classical music remains her first love, it was film music that gave her wide-spread fame and recognition, which she describes as her life’s “turning point”. “Malayalam composer M Jayachandran once listened to a rendition of mine in Amritavarshini raga. He commented that my voice was similar to that of MS Subbalakshmi, which was a huge compliment.” Vijayalakshmi went on to debut in Celluloid (2013), directed by Kamal, and has since forayed into all major film industries. While her first Tamil outing was in Santhosh Narayanan’s Cuckoo (2014), her most recent hit was a Sean Roldan track in Suriya-starrer Jai Bhim. “The song spoke about positivity, and it resonated with me.” She has worked with many established composers in the industry, but Vijayalakshmi has a dream: to sing for Ilaiyaraaja and AR Rahman someday. Currently, she has multiple film recordings lined up, apart from a few shows. She is also taking on a new avatar as music composer, in Malayalam film Oru Vattam Koodi, which has lyrics by Vinod. Her biggest learning in this journey? “Music is everything. That’s the only thing that will always be with me.”",Srinivasa Ramanujam,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/vaikom-vijayalakshmi-music-is-everything-to-me/article65086692.ece

1027,"February 24, 2022",17:43 IST,entertainment,music,The big question," I recently came across a YouTube video of Mythili Prakash dancing to T.M. Krishna’s singing. Their Instagram posts are about the declining standards in performance art, thanks to the demand for short “recorded” performances. The beauty of longer, “boring” presentations is fast being replaced by made-to-order, “less-than-a-minute”, high-resolution capsules. For one, this has changed the very art forms as they are presented on social media. Secondly, it has led to a surfeit of content that stands the danger of becoming cookie-cutter stuff. But, more significantly, and I have written about it earlier in this column, the very purpose of art is now to please people and see how to make the content go viral.  This has deeply impacted artistes who have been groomed in the old system of learning and performing. Recently, a friend of mine called to ask if I could create more interesting reels. For a minute I was taken aback, since the word ‘reel’ in Madras bhashai means to pull a fast one. But a reel is a one-minute (or less than) rendition for Instagram. Once on the gram, it competes with millions of others, who dance to the latest film numbers, reveal their unbelievable six-pack abs to adoring young audiences, or display other more titillating slices of virtual perfection.  It’s as if the entire world loves to constantly break into song and dance. This might not in itself be totally bad or undesirable — if it is going to help build a happier planet or lead to wellness. But what if, on the contrary, artistes are forced to surrender to the demands of these drastically changing times. What happens to their lifelong sadhakam and deeper dive into art? Do we just brush all this under the carpet? The 21st century post-pandemic reality calls for an urgent examination of this environment.  I recently attended a panel discussion, where participants spoke a lot about what constitutes art now, how performances should be curated, and the need to adapt to the new. To me, it was both underwhelming and conflicting.  Many of us are today being forced to take a stand in the virtual world. Stand in support of or against certain topics or statements. Anything we say or do assumes a political colour, while keeping silent is not taken very well either. Writer Manu Joseph summed it up perfectly when he said that being famous is a punishment in today’s world, and that it is easier to find contentment in having a niche for one’s work and adequate support to keep it going. The questions that Krishna and Mythili were asking, therefore, are important. What is the nature of the art we are creating and performing today? What kind of pedagogies do teachers need to craft? Is the long-form dead? Do we focus only on titillation and byte-sized renditions for the virtual medium?  But do we have the answers? The writer is a well-known pianist and educator and associate professor at Krea University.",Anil Srinivasan,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/the-big-question-in-art/article65080584.ece
1028,"February 24, 2022",17:35 IST,entertainment,music,Music in memory of Pt. Bhimsen Joshi," 
Bhimsen Joshi’s popularity and respect transcend gharanas and generations. Born on February 4, 1922, his birth centenary this year was celebrated with concerts in various cities across India, culminating in a three-day titled ‘Poornahuti’, featuring 38 artistes at Pune. The all-day event was organised by the Kanebua Pratishthan, which held a similar festival last year.  The first two days featured instrumentalists and Kathak dancers. Quite a few flautists performed, the first and foremost being maestro Pt. Hari Prasad Chaurasia accompanied by Debasmita and Suchismita Chatterji, followed by two of his senior disciples, Rakesh Chaurasia and Rupak Kulkarni. It was interesting to see how different the presentations of Rakesh and Rupak were — the former chose a light interpretation of the morning raag Lalit, flamboyantly presented in the gayaki style, foraying into unorthodox note combinations while opting for sprightly compositions. Ojas Adhiya on the tabla provided excellent and interactive interludes. Rupak followed the traditional tantrakaari presentation of aalap-jor-jhala, with an expert though sedate accompaniment by Mukesh Jadhav. Rupak chose the somewhat rare raag Prabhat Bhairav. Amar Oak, the fourth flautist, presented with elan the raag Vrindavani Sarang. His concert showed that he is as proficient in the classical idiom as in light music. Sitar exponent Pt. Nayan Ghosh’s Mian ki Todi stood out for its raagdari, proportion, and presentation and, for me, this was the most satisfying instrumental concert of the festival. Bringing in a pleasantly different approach was Purbayan Chatterji, of the Senia Maihar gharana, who interestingly played a raag of his own, a combination of Patdeep and Shahana. Sahana Bannerji, representing the Rampur Senia gharana, presented traditional and well-structured compositions. The only sarodiyas were brothers Amaan and Ayaan Ali Bangash; their inclusion in the festival was especially welcome as Pt. Bhimsen Joshi, while in Gwalior, had briefly learnt from their grandfather, Ustad Hafiz Ali Khan. Presenting the rarely played raag Lalita Gauri (which these days is usually heard only in vocal concerts), Amaan was in his element. The next raag they chose was Nandkauns. It was laudable to include the sarangi for a solo concert, presented by Jodhpur gharana’s Ustad Dilshad Khan, who played raag Gurjari Todi. Expert sarangi players are usually great musicians with a wealth of unusual compositions, gleaned from singers of all gharanas. Dilshad is a 10th generation exponent with enormous  riyaaz. Violin recitals by Pt. Atul Upadhye, and the next day by his son Tejas, and a jugalbandi by the mother-daughter duo of Sangeeta and Nandini Shankar were enjoyable. Saskia de Haas Rao on the cello played a jugalbandi with her sitariya husband Pt. Shubhendra Rao. There were also santoor recitals by Rahul Sharma and Ninad Daithankar; a somewhat disappointing slide guitar concert by Manish Pingle, whose control seemed shaky, and sundari and shehnai concerts by Pramod Gaikwad and Kalyan Apar. One missed the rudra veena and surbahar, two traditional instruments of the north, that are finding fewer performers. The concluding day featured only vocalists. This was a veritable treat, with singers from all gharanas. It was delightful to hear so many morning to night raags such as Mian ki Todi, Bairagi Bhairav, Kirwani, Desi Todi, Bhairon-Bahar, Jaunpuri, Samant Sarang, Multani, Shudha Sarang, Gaoti, Patdeep, Purvi, Puriya, Shuddha Kalyan, Kedara, Basant Bahar and Bhairavi. They were, however, not always presented in the correct sequence and, sadly, some were repeated, something never done by the older generation of musicians.  It was a wonderful opportunity to hear talented vocalists such as Prabhakar and Diwakar Kashyap of Banaras gharana and disciples of Pt. Rajan and Sajan Mishra; the Goa-based Pravin Goankar; Hemant Pendse; and, most interestingly, young Noushad-Nishad Harlapur from Karnataka. The brothers, still in their 20s, show promise. Concerts by Kalpana Zokarkar, Apoorva and Pallavi Joshi, Sanjeev Chimalgi, Manjusha Patil and Pt. Venkatesh Kumar were noteworthy, satisfying not just aurally but cerebrally too. The piece de resistance expectedly was the finale by Pt. Ulhas Kashalkar. It was his first live concert in the past two years and elicited a standing ovation from the audience. His incredibly masterful rendition of the jod raag Basant Bahar, which is extremely difficult to sing, brought alive the mood of spring. He demonstrated his unequalled position with his concluding raag, a sublime Bhairavi. ‘Poornahuti’ was an inclusive and appropriate tribute to Pt. Bhimsen Joshi. The organiser, Manjusha Patil, needs to be complimented for selecting worthy singers from all streams. Of course, one missed vocalists from the Patiala and Delhi gharanas, even while realising that it’s hard to accomodate so many artistes on a single day.  Pt. Venkatesh Kumar summed up the mood, “ Do saal hum sab ghar baithe sirf tambura ko dekh rahe the, aaj itna accha lag raha hai” (For two years, we sat home just looking at the tambura, it feels so good today).

1029,"February 24, 2022",17:23 IST,entertainment,music,INHERITOR OF A RICH BANI," In the Tyagaraja sishya parampara, the Lalgudi lineage has been the most profound, beginning with Lalgudi Rama Iyer. Lalgudi Jayaraman’s son, G.J.R. Krishnan, and daughter, Vijayalakshmi, who belong to the fifth generation, are carrying on the legacy. Lalgudi Vijayalakshmi’s solo violin concert at the Trinity festival, organised by the Kalakshetra Foundation, stood out for its musical craftsmanship. She began her concert with Tyagaraja’s ‘Nenarunchara napaini’ after a charming sketch of Simhavahini raga, a janyam of Sarasangi. The composer entreats Rama to show mercy on him. The kalpanaswaras brought out the many hues of the raga. A crisp Thodi alapana preceded Syama Sastri’s Swarajathi, ‘Rave himagiri kumari’, where the composer prays for the grace of goddess Kamakshi. Vijayalakshmi brought to the fore its stately pace and depth through the resonating strings of her instrument. Her vocal proficiency helped her play the kriti with accuracy. Dikshitar’s second vibhakti composition, ‘Santhana gopalakrishnam’ (Rupakam), in Khamas, was preceded by an impressive raga alapana. The brilliant swaraprastara, in madhyama kala, was at ‘Narthana Muralidharam’. The verve and soft sweep of raga Purvikalyani, brought out in the leisurely elucidation, with a stress on its cardinal swaras, had a lingering effect.  The rendering of Dikshitar’s ‘Meenakshi me mudham dehi’ by Vijayalakshmi was lit up by flashes of sober beauty. The unhurried niraval was at the usual ‘Madurapuri Nilaye’, followed by a bright sketch of the rare raga Vanaspati, the fourth Melakarta. In his composition ‘Pariyachakama’, the saint-composer asks Rama why he is ridiculing him. This was followed by yet another Tyagaraja kriti, ‘Anupama gunambudhi’ in Atana. The piece de resistance was the extensive interpretation of raga Sankarabharanam, with Tyagaraja’s ‘Manasu swaadhinamaina’ in leisurely misra chapu. Vijayalakshmi’s interpretation was in tune with the patantaram. The wide-ranging swaraprastara distilled the sweetness of Sankarabharanam. The thani by R. Sankaranarayanan (mridangam) and K.V. Gopalakrishnan (kanjira) was a display of rhythmic aesthetics and enriched the concert.  Dikshitar’s ‘Sri Rama Saraswathi’ in raga Nasamani (in Dikshitar school) was an apt interlude. Lalgudi Vijayalakshmi concluded her recital with Tyagaraja’s Devagandhari composition, ‘Koluvaiyunnaade Kodandapani’. She was accompanied by Kumari Krishnendu on the tambura. The Chennai-based writer specialises in Carnatic music.",H.Ramakrishnan,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/lalgudi-vijayalakshmi-upholds-the-patantaram/article65076644.ece
1030,"February 24, 2022",17:23 IST,entertainment,music,The veena village," “This is how it looks after a month of hard work,” says Manjunath Papanna, 40, whose family started the veena-making tradition in Simpadipura, a village in Doddaballapura, Karnataka. He shows me with pride the finished veena placed in the living room of his modest house.  Manjunath belongs to the third generation of the family that specialised in making Mysore veenas. The nonagenarian Penna Hoblayya, who is called Pennoblayya, learnt the craft when working with a veena-maker and taught it to his family members and other villagers.  The 1989 Karnataka state gazetteer mentions that the craftsmen at Simpadipura revived veena making in the 1950s after it faded out in Magadi in the same region. Says the 72-year-old Pappana (Manjunath’s father), “Pennoblayya is my uncle. I learnt the craft from him and passed it on to my son. A few families in the village are engaged in it.”  The craftsmen here work on the Mysore veena, which is made of aged jackfruit tree wood. “The trees are the ones that are over 100 years old, have stopped bearing fruit, and are basically of no other use. It is difficult to source these trees, usually the vendors whom we sell the veenas to help us procure them.”  I see a large tree trunk being cut to make the round sound box. One trunk can be used to make about 20 such boxes. It usually takes about 15 days to make a veena, and they are primarily supplied to Veena Works in Basavanagudi in Bengaluru. The cost ranges from Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 15,000 per instrument, based on its quality and the designs on the veena. According to Manjunath, “There are different types of designs. The bodi veena has no design. A craftsman can make about three to four veenas in a month, depending on the complexity of the design and carving.” The pandemic has hit the business hard, yet the villagers continue making the instrument as it is their skill of sustenance. The four parts of the instrument — taley (head), koda (sound box), dandi (neck), and taley dhoni (peg box) are made by the craftsmen. The strings are then attached and the instrument given a proper finish by the vendors who regularly buy them from these craftsmen.  Says Raju, whose father started Veena Works in Bengaluru, “We supply the wood to the craftsmen at Simpadipura or they procure it from the mill in the village. Some of the master craftsmen have passed on or are too old. However, this is one of the places where the Mysore veena is still made. Once I get the veena, I work on fixing the seven strings that are strung over the 24 fixed frets.” At Manjunath’s small workshop, situated amidst the fields (they grow sandalwood, silver oak and mahogany), I notice simple tools like chisels and knives being used to carve the wood. “We make these tools ourselves. The kind of carving we do depends on the client’s requirement,” he says. While many youngsters of Simpadipura have moved to the city to earn a livelihood, there are a few who have returned to the village to continue the legacy. The craftsmen rue the lack of support from the government that has failed to recognise their efforts in keeping a tradition alive.  Says Manjunath, “Instead of earning ₹10,000 in the city, I would rather work in my village and do what makes me happy. But I am not sure if my daughter will take up the craft. Maybe I can train her to be a veena artiste.” The Bengaluru-based author is a freelance writer and photographer.",Bindu Gopal Rao,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/the-veena-village/article65080523.ece
1031,"February 24, 2022",17:18 IST,entertainment,music,A high energy concert by G. Ravikiran," G. Ravikiran’s concert for Laya Madhura cruised ahead on twin engines — Tyagaraja kritis and good rendition. There is a continuing debate in the Carnatic world between familiarity and disruptive novelty. We may not have arrived at a verdict, but a well-rendered ‘Evarimata’ in Kamboji does trump a spectacularly rendered unknown song any day. Kudos to Ravikiran for not being tempted by the novelty-at-all-costs approach of his generation. ‘Narada guruswamy’ in Darbar (Tyagaraja) was a good opener even though the slower tempo held back the real charm of Darbar. It is rare for a big Kalyani kriti to be bereft of raga alapana and Ravikiran pledged his faith again in the lovely Tyagaraja kriti, with the durita kala charanam offering a different perspective of the composer. He sang an attractive lingering niraval, mostly in the upper scale at ‘bhajana seyave’, and wrapped it up in standard swara lines.  Ravikiran’s approach to Dhanyasi raga alapana involved sustains and karvais and eschewed roller-coasters. It fitted the raga very well. Violinist L. Ramakrishnan claimed his stake in the serene proceedings. ‘Nee chittamu nishkalamu’ by Tyagaraja in misra chapu seemed a perfect choice to elevate the Dhanyasi mood. Niravals and swaras are not necessary for every main or sub-main piece and one felt vindicated that some youngsters do seem to understand this. The singer lost his way with a jaded version of ‘Panchabutha’ (Kiranavali, Dikshitar, khanda ekam) that seemed to lack conviction. Besides the chittaswaram, perhaps a short bout of swaras would have enhanced its sketch. ‘Atukaradani’ (Tyagaraja, Manoranjani) at a brisk pace did not add value either, even if it was meant to break the tempo. In his Kamboji alapana, Ravikiran gave primacy to pleasantness rather than flashes of manodharama. Ramakrishnan took about one-third of that time to weave through the raga aesthetically. ‘Evarimata vinnavo’ was authentic and the full lava of the Kamboji volcano flowed. Ravikiran’s niraval at ‘bhakta paradhi’ in the first speed was very engaging and one actually longed to stay more in that moment. The swaras that followed were interesting in the slower speed. In both niraval and swaras, the faster versions were template driven. ‘Sapasya Kausalya’ in Jhonpuri has a vintage appeal and Ravikiran vocalised each sangati with clarity and the right emphasis. Ramakrishnan was frugal with time but generous with melody throughout. Arun Prakash swayed between a five-day test match inching towards a draw and the slog overs of a T20 game. His thani had an engaging structure. Guruprasad on the ghatam backed up the concert competently. Ravikiran’s energy was consistently high. He uses his voice training as ammunition for unblemished execution. He may have gained a few more marks with varying kalapramanams and sandwiching intelligent laya in the swaras. Audience intensity, perhaps unintentionally, suffers when artistes seek too much recovery time between pieces. The old masters knew exactly how to ensure a smooth flow. The writer is a classical music critic and commentator.",Bala Shankar,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/a-high-energy-concert-by-g-ravikiran/article65080501.ece
1032,"February 24, 2022",17:08 IST,entertainment,music,The high note," The year was 2016. Shantanu Moitra’s songs had been scaling up the charts for over a decade, but the composer wanted to get away from the hype of success and failure in Bollywood and the humdrum of city life. He packed his bags and set out on a 100-day journey to the Himalayas with his photographer-friend Dhritiman Mukherjee.  “I didn’t have any musical agenda. I went without a recorder. Sometimes you just need to travel without a purpose,” says Shantanu, ahead of his show on February 27, at NCPA (National Centre for the Performing Arts), Mumbai, which is inspired by this trip. His first stop was Ladakh. For eight days, he just absorbed the stunning sights and sounds of the region. He would sit or walk around looking at people and chatting with them. “It taught me important life lessons. For instance, there was this Changpa woman whose livelihood was rearing sheep. One night, a snow leopard killed her flock of five sheep. The next morning, I saw her sitting with a child on her lap. I asked her what she would do now. She replied matter-of-factly, “Yeh toh unka ghar hai, hum toh unke mehman hain (this is the house of the snow leopard, we are only guests here).” Shantanu plans to narrate many such riveting stories at the show, as he feels the music of the mountains is an extension of life. He will perform with Ani Choying, a Buddhist nun from Nako Gompa in Nepal; Hindustani vocalist Kaushiki Chakraborty; and violinist Ambi Subramaniam. The songs, without lyrics, are based on the sounds of the landscape, and are conveyed through swaras and chants. From Ladakh, Shantanu journeyed to Lahaul-Spiti, Uttarakhand, Nepal, Tibet, and finally reached Arunachal Pradesh. “Only when you travel, you realise there is art all around. While camping at that high altitude (14,000 ft), I strangely found myself humming classical tunes. The topography seemed to reflect the highs and lows of the octaves. It felt like I was reconnecting with my Banaras roots (his family hails from the city), where our home constantly resonated with music.” ‘100 days in the Himalayas’ is about experiencing a land through its music. “To me, it has been an internal journey, at the end of which I began to look at myself and my music from a new perspective,” says the composer, who went on a Ganga trail last December, cycling for over two months from Gomukh to Ganganagar.",Chitra Swaminathan,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/call-of-the-wanderer/article65079768.ece
1033,"February 24, 2022",14:58 IST,entertainment,music,Indian jazz is upping the ante again," Back in 2019, at the height of pre-pandemic freedom, unrestricted musical events, and generous budgets, The Many Roots Ensemble was an eight-piece Indian jazz band. Besides the multi-city core of guitarist, bassist, drummer and saxophone player, “we had a three-piece song section, a keyboard player, a percussion guy and rappers,” recalls guitarist Subid Khan about their NH7 Weekender performance. Now, it is just the core four making music on their own. It makes sense for a band like Many Roots to have a fluid crop of talent at its disposal: its signature sound blends jazz with a variety of North African and West African music, as well as Afro beats from Nigeria, along with elements of Indian folk and street music. The demand of each composition is different, so “when the occasion and budget allows, we get featuring acts,” says Subid over a call from Goa, where he is currently making music with Jarryd Rodrigues, Souvik Bhattacharya and Abhishek Debsidkar. Many Roots will be making its debut in South India with a performance at Chennai’s Black Orchid restobar this Friday, kicking off the Southside Groove Tour with Chennai-based jazz-rock band Jatayu.  The three-stop tour, put together by Shrikanth Natarajan of The Chennai Scene, will be taking the two bands to Catamaran Brewing Co in Puducherry and Fandom at Gilly’s Redefined in Bengaluru as well, in the hope of exposing music lovers to newer, more playful versions of homegrown Indian jazz. As comparatively younger musical acts, albeit with steady followings within the country’s indie circuit, they are not the only Indian jazz artistes looking to build an audience in the country. As Jatayu guitarist Sahib Singh explains, “Conceptually, both of us [Jatayu and Many Roots] are doing the same thing: we are both collaborative projects looking to work with different artistes. The music for both is progressive and open-minded, be it our Carnatic jazz or their Afro beat-influenced jazz. We have been meaning to play with Many Roots, who have never played down South, so we thought we would show them around.” This will be Jatayu’s second tour in recent months, after its Restless Tour with Harini Iyer in Delhi, Gurugram and Hyderabad. Collaboration is inherent to jazz with the genre demanding to be played with. So, obediently enough, after Harini, Jatayu is currently working with a number of Indian and international artistes including Chennai-based jazz vocalist Susha to release a string of singles. Bands like Jatayu, Till Apes, The Revisit Project, The Many Roots Ensemble are part of the latest crop of Indian Jazz musicians — the newest wave in a tide that has been steadily turning for over two decades now. For Tanish Thakker, who co-runs the platform Jazz in India founded by Emmanuel De Decker, making note of upcoming talent, platforms and festivals is an everyday task. He explains, “They are what we call the new jazz cats. There are so many different genres and different styles of Jazz today. First you have the calibre of Gino Banks, Rhythm Shaw, Vasundara Vee, Mohini Dey, Ravi Chari and Rakesh Chaurasia and many more in that space.”  This top tier is not something Tanish defines by age or era, but by pure calibre. It includes Louis Banks who has been making music since the 1990s and is still active today, and Rhythm Shaw who is yet to hit the age of 30, both of whom in their own separate ways have been creating magic, and taking Indian jazz abroad on global tours. And then there have been musicians like the late Madhav Chari, popular on the global stage for his dedication to pure jazz, without new-age influences.  “Then,” adds Tanish, “You have talented people like Anubha Kaul, Shirish Malhotra, Aman Jagwani, Shreyas Iyengar, Anurag Naidu, Shreya Bhattacharaya, Avishek Dey in Mumbai / Pune and The Bodhisattva Trio guys from Kolkata. Then there are the new guys coming up with the neo-soul, rnb & soul styles, like Ranjani Ramadoss, Jatayu, Fakeer & The Arc, Second Sight and the list goes on.” The roster of talent spans towns, cities and states across the country, aided and abetted by a host of jazz clubs. Most of these new clubs are less than a decade old, but have been steady in both their search and their programming of fresh talent. While The Piano Man Jazz Club has been organising indie performances in Delhi since 2015 and Gurugram since 2019, Shisha Jazz Cafe in Pune has been regular with its jazz night since 2003.  On the other hand, Skinny Mo’s Jazz Club opened in an old Art Deco building in Kolkata as recently as in 2019. Encouraging music that blends Indian ethos with the playfulness of jazz, these clubs have been consciously trying to keep alive the country’s relationship with jazz, a tryst that began as early as the 1930s, the era when the African American violinist Leon Abbey brought a jazz band to India, and Bombay’s Taj Mahal Palace Hotel famously opened its stage to jazz that was, for the first time, non-white.  That era was a far cry from today, when The Piano Man Jazz Club founder Arjun Sagar Gupta has a dedicated curation team “who are now documenting city-wise artists, two cities per week, and reaching out to them for verification and bios so that we can improve our database.” Sagar Gupta, a jazz musician in his own right, also maintains a network with embassies and international touring managers, and is hopeful of having 30 international artistes visiting in the second half of the year.  And yet, despite performances by the likes of 23-Grammy-winner Chick Corea, a bulk of Arjun’s programming remains focused on local talent: “From five shows a week on Day one and seven shows a week by our third month, we went to two shows a day — lunch and dinner — post the first wave. Currently, we host 28 shows a week between the two clubs.”  Clearly, there is enough talent and more. Says Arjun, “About 12 years ago, I could count the number of talented Indian jazz artistes on the fingertips of two hands. Now, we have a couple of dozen people per city who are really good. We also have the cream of the crop coming up, who can hold their own on the international circuit.” For details about the Southside Groove Tour, visit www.skillboxes.com or @thechennaiscene on Instagram.",Meghna Majumdar,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/indian-jazz-bands-tour-country-international/article65073499.ece

Inspired by the 2015 game Bloodborne by FromSoftware Inc, the single is a horror-themed song, fast-paced, and aggressive. The song revolves around an obsessed gamer finding himself stuck in a never-ending loop to get the better of a Lovecraftian monster. While his determination and desperation finally prevail, the feeling is bittersweet as he ends up losing his mental peace – a feeling most gamers would relate to as they finally see the words ‘Game Over’.

That is what you can expect if you play Techland’s Dying Light 2: Stay Human.  Get ‘First Day First Show’, our weekly newsletter from the world of cinema, in your inbox. You can subscribe for free here The year’s first AAA (big-budget, blockbuster) title had plenty of intrigue surrounding not just its storyline but its gameplay on next-gen consoles and PCs. Despite its bugs at launch and somewhat predictable storyline, the gameplay itself motivated gamers to stick around till the end. Dying Light 2 follows Aiden, a social outcast, trying to find his sister in a world devastated by a virus... but the game has a ray of light amid all the chaos and ‘Lord of the Flies’ politics.  Sign up to our Technology newsletter, Today’s Cache, for insights on emerging themes at the intersection of technology, business and policy. Click here to subscribe for free. Treating this essence very seriously from the start of pre-production is the game’s composer Olivier Deriviere, who sees video games as “a cultural object [that] reflects our world, society, existence.” Three years of working on the game produced a score that breathed life into a game of the undead, and gamers often find themselves bobbing their heads in time with the music— whether they are doing a fun exploration of the world, making a plot-changing decision or engaging in the most brutal combat.  Deriviere is thrilled at the response gamers have had to the music to the much-awaited sequel to the 2017 game. Avid gamers would be familiar with some of the titles he has worked on such as A Plague Tale: Innocence (2019), Remember Me (2013), Vampyr (2018) and Streets of Rage 4 (2020). In an interview with The Hindu, Deriviere dives into why this project deserved a custom instrument and creating a new layer of immersiveness through music. Edited excerpts: 
The Creative Director [Adrian Cizweski] didn’t want the game to be about fear and despair but rather hope and empowerment. Overall the game is fun to play, and to make the experience too serious and dark may have contrasted too much with the entertaining parkour and chaos that players can create with each situation. The story can have some dark and emotional parts and I was really happy to compose very different colours, themes and music depending on the situations.
 
I have a strong team spirit. It is key for me to interact as much as needed with the creative director and the game director; for Dying Light 2, I spent three years fully committed with Techland. We were having daily meetings to make sure the vision from Adrian was well understood and that the gameplay mechanics developed by Marc would be supported correctly with music.
 
I am always experimenting as I usually don’t know what I am going to do and, more importantly, how I am going to do it. It is always scary at first but I think this is what a creative person should go for: the unknown. For each project I do, I try to create a music identity that will be fully part of the DNA of the game and Dying Light 2 was no exception.
 
Dying Light 2 is about a young man who is trying to find his sister in a broken city after a world pandemic that killed most of the humans. I wanted to capture this feeling through one instrument so I went to my friend and instrument creator extraordinaire Nicolas Bras and he created the ‘Electric Psaltery’ which is made out of metal and junk materials. It has three guitar necks and you can play with your fingers or a bow. It is a very broken sound which fits the game’s mood perfectly.
 
Much of my work is to dedicate music to the player’s experience. Most of the time there is a team helping the composer to create the interactive score but I had such a strong idea of what I wanted the music to do that I did it on my own.
 
This is by far the most complicated aspect of my job and I am thrilled to see the reception from the gamers. I really wanted them to feel that the music was supporting any actions, even parkour movements, in the game and it seems to have paid off.
 
It was a constant conversation; mixing a game is very difficult but the tools that we have nowadays allow so much flexibility that there is no wrongdoing between music and sound effects. We can adapt in real-time (when the game runs) any volume depending on what is going on and if a big explosion happens, then the music goes softer but if a big emotional scene needs a big swelling score, the music takes over. The technology in games is getting to a point where the only limitation is our imagination.
 
No, not really. It is more a matter of when and why a musical moment would happen that really was the main conversation with Adrian. I would start something very soft but he would tell me that the intention has changed and now he needs action or fear. It is much more this process of back and forth as the game is in development than having music rejected.
 
I always start composing when it is the right time and since I am so close with the team it is unlikely (though still could happen) that I would be wrong while in production. However, in pre-production, I tend to try a lot of styles and themes and this is when I know I can be wrong but this is how you align with the creative director. We learn what our sensitivities are and we adapt to each other.
 
I don’t want to extrapolate too much but I think a lot of creators are influenced by their surroundings and the fact that many games ake place in a post-apocalypse setting may not be so disconnected from our time…yet, it is also a great opportunity to create entertainment experiences. Concerning my involvement, whatever the game and when possible, I try to focus on the human aspect of it. The deep-down emotions, the complexity of existence, the hard choices we all have to make.

1039,"February 17, 2022",19:30 IST,entertainment,music,"The busy bee
composer"," Lec-dems on the life and works of musicians of the past open up a window to an era gone by and to know how music has evolved over decades. At The Music Academy, Ritha Rajan presented an interesting account of Ramanathapuram ‘Poochi’ Srinivasa Iyengar, an eminent musician-composer, one of the most well-known after the Trinity. An outstanding third generation musician of the Manambuchavadi sishya parampara of Tyagaraja, he belonged to the Chellur Iyengar community, who are believed to have migrated from Chelluru or Selvanallur in the East Godavari district during the 9th century, settling mostly in Madurai, Sivaganga and Ramanathapuram. Born to Narayana Iyengar and Lakshmi Ammal in Pappankulam in Ramanathapuram district, young Srinivasa inherited his interest in music from his mother, a good singer. Talking about his moniker ‘Poochi’, meaning insect, Ritha quoted Tamil scholar U.Ve Swaminatha Iyer, who said he got the name because his singing was as melodious as a bee’s hum.  Srinivasa matriculated from Ramanathapuram High School in first class. Pandithurai Thevar, a schoolmate, who later became the zamindar of Palavanatham, identified his musical aptitude and was responsible for his learning under Patnam Subramania Iyer. Srinivasa, an admirer of Maha Vaidyanatha Iyer, imbibed a lot from his raga alapana and pallavi singing. Poochi Iyengar’s concerts Srinivasa Iyengar’s concerts usually began with the Bhairavi ata tala varnam ‘Viribhoni’, followed by a few keertanas with antara gandhara. He often included Muthuswami Dikshitar’s ‘Neelotpala nayike’ (Nariritigowla) and ‘Subrahmanyaya namaste’ (Kamboji); Kavi Matrubhuthayya’s ‘Neemadi challaga’ (Anandabhairavi); and ‘Garuda gamana’ (Nagaswaravali) and ‘Nee padamula’ (Bhairavi) by his guru Patnam Subramania Iyer. He usually sang the pallavis, ‘Mandahasa vadana’ in Sankarabharanam, or ‘Ma Madura Meenakshi’ in Bhairavi. Towards the end of his performances, he used to render some of his own compositions and conclude with a javali and thillana. His favourite ragas were Shanmukhapriya, Sankarabharanam, Kalyani, Kapi, Varali, Begada, Sahana and Husseini.  Quoting from Soolamangalam Vaidyanatha Bhagavatar’s weekly column, ‘Karnataka Sangita Vidwangal’ in Kalki magazine, Ritha said that Srinivasa Iyengar kept his performances simple with melody as focus. He did not encourage the accompanists to dominate, and the tani avarthanam was restricted to a few minutes at the end of the concert. Many disciples He had many disciples. Prominent among them were Salem Duraisamy Iyengar, Kandanur Srinivasa Iyengar, Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar, Karaikudi Rajamani Iyengar, Kuttalam Srinivasa Iyer, Koteeswara Iyer (who also learnt from Patnam Subramania Iyer) Ettayapuram Rajagopala Bhagavatar (son of Ettayapuram Ramachandra Bhagavatar of Dikshitar sishya parampara), and Mayavaram Sivaram Iyer. Sharing a couple of anecdotes from the book, Meri Dakshin Bharat ki Sangeet Yatra by musician V.N. Bhatkhande, who went to Ramanathapuram to interview Srinivasa Iyengar, Ritha said, “He learnt many Hindustani raags through one of his sishyas, Sankara Pandit, who hailed from Gwalior. He even used to sing a bandish, ‘Pyar de’ in raag Purva in his concerts. From some anecdotes  She read a passage from Karnamrutha Sagaram, a book by Abraham Pandithar, that said Srinivasa Iyengar sang exactly like his guru. Mysore Vasudevachar in his book, Naa Kanda Kalavidaru, says Srinivasa was Patnam Subramania Iyer’s first disciple and Vasudevachar the last. He writes how he was inspired to learn from Patnam Iyer after listening to Srinivasa Iyengar’s Sankarabharanam pallavi ‘Mandahasa vadana’ at Veena Seshanna’s house in Mysore. Narrating an interesting anecdote, Ritha said Mysore Vasudevachar sang his own composition ‘Janakendra Sutha priya’ in Megharanjani at Nalvadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar’s wedding. When it was Srinivasa Iyengar’s turn to perform, he too sang his own piece, ‘Karunatho nannu’, in the same raga. Vasudevachar asked him if he could change the raga of his composition, to which Srinivasa Iyengar cited the example of Tyagaraja’s ‘Manasu swadheena’ and Dikshitar’s ‘Akshayalinga vibho’ in Sankarabharanam, and said that the similarity was a blessing of their guru. Teaching sessions  In his book, Vasudevachar described Srinivasa Iyengar’s teaching method as ‘rakshasa sadakam’, after he had watched him teach the Begada Ata tala varnam individually to each disciple. Similarly, referring to his appetite, he described it as ‘rakshasa sappadu’, since he consumed large quantities of food.  Soolamangalam V. Radhakrishna Bhagavatar in ‘An account of Thyagarajaswamy Aradhana’ talks about Srinivasa Iyengar’s involvement in conducting the aradhana for the first time in Tiruvaiyaru in 1906. Interestingly, Bangalore Nagarathnamma would begin the aradhana by singing Poochi Iyengar’s ‘Sadguru swamiki’ in Ritigowla.  The composer has written tana and pada varnams, keerthanas, javalis, thillana, a kavadi chindu in Tamil, and a navaratnamalika in nine ragas. He composed in Sanskrit, Telugu and Tamil, and his mudra was Srinivasa, though a few compositions do not bear any mudra. His compositions are published in Sangitanubhava Sara Sangraham by Perungulam V. Srinivasa Iyengar, Venkateswara Tana Varnangal by Kakinada C.S. Krishnaswamy Iyer, Sangita Abhimani (1936), Sangita Kalpadhruma (1947), and The Music Academy’s Rare compositions of Patnam Subramania Iyer, Ramnad Srinivasa Iyengar and other composers edited by Mudicondan Venkatrama Iyer (1958), as well as in books by N. C. Parthasarathy (1980), Salem Chellam Iyengar (1982), and Rangaramanuja Iyengar’s Kriti Mani Malai (Volume 4). While ‘Ninnukori’ in Mohanam and ‘Neranammiti’ in Kanada are the most popular of his varnams, Akshya and Shruthi S. Bhat, alumni of the Advanced School of Carnatic Music, who accompanied Ritha Rajan on the presentation, sang ‘Rara sami’, a rarely heard varnam in Anandabhairavi.  There are about 25 well-known keertanas, of which ‘Anudinamu’ (Begada), ‘Sadbhaktiyu’ (Anandabhairavi), ‘Samajavarada’ (Suddha Saveri), ‘Parthasarathy nannu’ (Madhyamavati), ‘Nee padamule gatiyeni’ (Navarasa Kannada), ‘Neekela nayeda’ (Deva Manohari), and ‘Parama pavana Rama’ (Purvikalyani) are available with notations.   Chittaswara specialist  Chittaswaras woven into the kritis was Poochi’s speciality. While the chittaswaras for Tyagaraja’s kritis were composed later and are hence usually in free-flowing sarvalagu patterns, Poochi’s chittaswarams are highly planned, said Ritha.  His keerthanas tend to be in chowka kalam, adi tala 2 kalais, such as ‘Saraguna palimpa’, ‘Parama pavana’, and ‘Sri Raghukula nidhim’ in Husseini. The one in Thodi, ‘Satatamu brovumayya’, that he composed in praise of George V on his India visit, is also set in 2 kalais. Citing ‘Sri Venkatesham varam’ in Thodi, Ritha pointed out that Poochi Iyengar was also adept in composing kritis in Rupaka tala 2 kalai, which is a challenge, although Papanasam Sivan composed a few.  Seven of the composer’s javalis are available. Also fond of creating thillanas, of the 12 thillanas he set, the one in Kapi in Lakshmisa tala with 108 beats in a cycle, and another in Kamavardhini in Ragavardhini, a tala of 72 beats, prove his versatility.  Aptly, Ritha played a recording of ‘Na dir dheem’ sung by Lata Mangeshkar in the film Pardesi, which is based on Poochi’s Sankarabharanam thillana. The Chennai-based reviewer  writes on classical music.",R.

1040,"February 16, 2022",14:16 IST,entertainment,music,Sangeetha Varma composes song on women’s empowerment," Composer, singer and lyricist Sangeetha Varma sees music as one seamless entity. “All the parts should blend in such a way that the listener experiences it as pure music,” she says. One of the few female music composers from Kerala, Sangeetha considers it a unique experience being able to give words, melody and voice to a song. Her most recent song for the Malayalam film ‘The Identity’, will be released on March 8, International Women’s Day. The song, ‘Engum Pakaliravil’, written and composed by her is a powerful take on the strength of an “ordinary woman”. The film, written and directed by R Chandra Vadhana, who runs the NGO Prayaana that works towards empowerment of women, urges women, especially homemakers, to wake up and realise their full potential.  “As a woman, I felt close to the theme and it is universal. Every woman would be able to relate to it in some way,” says Sangeetha. The lyrics and the music came to me effortlessly as I was moved by the theme. “I wanted it to convey the idea of a resurgence, of hope,” she adds. Ramadevi Thyagarajan has sung the song.  Sangeetha has composed for the 2013-trilingual film Cleopatra, directed by Rajan Sankaradi, starring Manoj K Jayan, Vineeth and Sudha Chandran. She cherishes the experience as she could direct K J Yesudas and S P Balasubrahmaniam. “Being in the studio with Das Sir in itself was a dream-come-true for me,” she says. “SPB sir sang the song for the Telugu version of the film. He treated me like a daughter and we spoke at length.” In addition to Yesudas and SPB, she has worked with most of the prominent singers in the industry.  Music composition is still largely a male bastion, she says. “In the history of film music, we have had few women as composers. Those days, composers had to spend long hours in studios as recording and orchestration would often run into the wee hours. The environment was unsuitable for most women as they had family responsibilities to take care of,” she says. Today, technology has brought in a huge change to the industry. “Everything is done remotely and in the confines of our own homes. With COVID-19, this even became the norm.” Technology also throws open several platforms for women composers to showcase their talents, she adds.  Sangeetha, who has a post-graduate degree in music from the Government College for Women, Thiruvananthapuram, was initiated into the world of music by her father, Kochappan Thampuran, her first guru. She spent the lockdown days working on songs and would tune songs written by other lyricists. “Being a woman, other women find it easier to communicate with me. I have had many of them come forward with poetry they had written and wished to listen to as songs. Music, ultimately has to bring people together,” she says.

1041,"February 16, 2022",13:49 IST,entertainment,music,Remembering Bappi Lahiri’s Telugu cinema chartbusters," Hours after the news of music director and singer Bappi Lahiri’s demise, Telugu superstar Chiranjeevi took to social media to share his condolences. He was nostalgic as he recalled his association with the composer: “He gave numerous chartbusters for me which contributed immensely to the popularity of my films. He will always be remembered for his unique style and his great enthusiasm for life, which reflected in his music.”  One of Bappi Lahiri’s immensely popular Telugu albums is the Chiranjeevi and Vijayashanti-starrer Gang Leader (1991). The film and its music have a high recall value among Telugu film buffs to date. Think of a catchy, hummable rain song and ‘Vaana vaana velluvaye’ is still a favourite for many. Two decades later, memories of the song were brought back into public memory afresh when composer Mani Sharma remixed it for Ram Charan and Tamannaah Bhatia’s Rachcha. The other Bappiri Lahiri and Chiranjeevi films include State Rowdy,Rowdy Alludu and Big Boss. Bappi Lahiri composed for several Telugu films from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, predominantly for films starring Krishna, Mohanbabu, Chiranjeevi, Balakrishna and Venkatesh. His musical oeuvre ranged from foot-tapping numbers to a few folksy tunes.  Lahiri’s first association with Telugu cinema was for the 1986 film Simhasanam, directed by Krishna, in which he starred alongside Jaya Prada, Radha and Mandakini. Unlike the psychedelic disco tunes that the composer was renowned for, this film required him to compose for a folklore-inspired story.  Lahiri then composed for Thene Manasulu (remake of Souten) and Trimurtulu (remake of Naseeb). Interestingly, the Hindi soundtracks of both these films were not composed by Lahiri. Usha Khanna composed for Souten while Laxmikant-Pyarelal did the honours for Naseeb.

1042,"February 15, 2022",22:19 IST,entertainment,music,Legendary Bengali singer Sandhya Mukhopadhyay passes away at 90," Legendary Bengali singer Sandhya Mukhopadhyay passed away in Kolkata on Tuesday after a brief illness. She was 90.
Sandhya Mukhopadhyay took Bengali songs to new heights, whether it was playback singing for films or songs released during Durga Puja, which emerged as a new genre and labelled modern Bengali songs (“adhunik gaan”).
The singer took her first music lessons from her parents Narendranath Mukhopadhyay and mother Hemaprabha Devi. A trained classical singer who with equal ease took to different forms of singing — from playback to folk songs, Rabindra Sangeet and bhajans — trained under Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan and was later associated with legends like Begum Akhtar.
 Sandhya Mukherjee’s first record was in 1945 and her first album of Durga Puja songs was released in 1948. Soon, offers for playback singing in Bengali films started coming in. Her first playback singing was for film Samapika released in 1948.
 In 1971, she bagged the national award for best female playback singer for songs in the films Jai Jayanti ( 1970) and Nishi Padma ( 1970). To people of West Bengal and Bengalis across the globe, Sandhya Mukherjee was Gitashree (eminent singer) and considered an empress of Bengali playback singing.
Last month, the singer declined the Padma Shri award by the Union government, an honour which according to her family members she considered “too little too late”. Sandhya Mukhopadhyay was admitted to a State–run hospital on January 28 and then was transferred to a private health facility in the city for better medical care.
Among the most popular songs are classics like  “Ei Path Jyodi na Sesh hoe” from the Uttam Kumar-Suchitra Sen starrer Saptapadi. For Bangabandhu Mujibur Rahman, she sang “ Bangabandhu Phire Elo tomar.” Known for her duets with Hemanta Mukhopadhyay, Sandhya Mukhopadhyay gave voice to screen icons like Madhubala and Suchitra Sen.  With Lata Mangeshkar she sang the classic duet “ Bol Papihe Bol’ ’for the film Tarana in 1951
She was awarded Banga Bibhushan, the highest honour in West Bengal, by the State government in 2011.
West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said the final rites of the singer will be performed with full state honours on Wednesday. Ms. Banerjee who is in north Bengal on official business, said she will return to Kolkata on Wednesday. “To me, Sandhya Mukhopadhyay was Bharat Ratna. With her death we have lost the brightest star in the sky of Bengali music,” she said.",Shiv Sahay Singh,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/legendary-bengali-singer-sandhya-mukhopadhyay-passes-away-at-90/article65053669.ece
1044,"February 12, 2022",17:54 IST,entertainment,music,The indie class of 2022," Independent artists in India have been in and out of action since early 2020 — though adapting at every turn, jumping off quickly-eroding stepping stones as though they were in a video game. Late in 2021, Bacardi NH7 Weekender, one of the country’s mainstay events for indie music discovery, announced they would return to an on-ground edition in February in Pune, Delhi NCR and Kolkata. But as the third wave rolled in, it had to issue an update that they were postponing all their events until further notice. The unpredictability of the live events industry has meant that there’s just one sure-fire avenue for independent artists to make it: the digital space. Through streaming platforms, clutter-breaking music videos (cheeky ones with a visual aesthetic to edgier takes embracing cultural roots and femininity) community-building apps like Discord, or even NFTs, they have learned the ropes of thriving despite the lack of gigs. Even if 2022 hands us another round of musical chairs when it comes to live performances, these artists are ready to launch into the stratosphere. Sound: Everything from hip-hop to Tamil pop to jazz and soul
   Sample this:  ‘
Attached ’, the buoyant, action-filled bop off her collaborative EP
593, Vol. I with producers Clifr and Issamood
  Bengaluru-based Ranjani Ramadoss, 23, first wowed as a vocalist-saxophonist in 2020 when fusion band Kelvikkuri began gigging fervently in South India. Since then she’s been proving there’s a lot more to her — her debut solo single was an open-hearted Tamil song ‘
Nee Mattume ’ and she quickly teamed up with music producer friends such as Samudra Dasgupta aka Issamood and Chlipher Christopher aka Clifr for an EP project titled
593, Vol. I , a smash blend of bold funk, soul, pop, hip-hop and more.
  In addition to being confirmed for NH7 Weekender for a set with Clifr, RANJ has quickly become in demand, picking up collaborations with the likes of guitarist-composer Sanjeev T and Mumbai duo Second Sight. Sound: Mellower psychedelic rock that occasionally bursts into swirling shoegaze
   
Sunflower Tape Machine Sample this: ‘
Sophomore Sweetheart ’, a dreamy journey informed by the likes of Tame Impala
  Chennai-based Aryaman Singh, 19, is the brains behind his one-man project Sunflower Tape Machine. With just three singles out — ‘
Sophomore Sweetheart ’, ‘
Death. Colourised ’ and ‘
Within You ’ — he’s proved that the power of psychedelic rock can surpass generations. Paired with flourishes of mind-bending styles like shoegaze and dream-pop, Sunflower Tape Machine ended up in Spotify’s Fresh Finds 2021 playlist globally and has so far been tapped to perform in Chennai and Mumbai.
 His latest single ‘Internet Friends’ arrived via Mumbai-based label Export Quality Records on February 4, as an ode to all the long-distance friendships we’ve cultivated. Colour us hyped. Sound: Playful reggae mixed with hip-hop and R&B
   Sample this: ‘
Bless Ya Heels ’, a life-affirming, sensual anthem that intertwines divinity with femininity over Afrobeats
  Kottayam-based Tribemama Marykali aka Anna Katharina Valayil, 37, had a different life before she became a singer — studying media and training to become a pilot. But she had been introduced to Madonna’s music at around age six, which had created a deep-rooted inclination towards music and becoming an artist. By 2012, she had already become known in the Malayalam film world for singing ‘
Mel Mel Mel ’ and ‘Appangal embadum’ in
Ustad Hotel .
   As an independent artist, however, the last two years have been a gradual takeover with English and Malayalam songs. Crooning with a pronounced friskiness on songs like ‘
Freakay ’, ‘
Bless Ya Heels ’ and ‘
Concrete Jungle ’ (a collaboration with neo hip-hop group T.ill APES), Marykali also taps into an Afro vibe, drawing from her childhood in Nigeria. Expect more singles and benchmark-setting aesthetics from the artist this year.
 Sound: The boldness of hip-hop weaved into friendly pop, Nineties rock and Bollywood
   Sample this: ‘
Milansaar ’, an acoustic guitar and
tabla aided lover-boy anthem punctuated by an emphatic sample that goes ‘
Jai ho !’
  Udbhav Acharya, 23, is a New Delhi-based artist who raps like a beast but also turns on the charm like a hero straight out of an early 2000s Hindi movie. A beatmaker/producer as well as singer, Udbhav — and Teesri Duniya, the crew he’s part of — has quickly come to represent alternative hip-hop in India’s machismo-flexing circuit. Existentialism is a key theme that has run through the three albums he’s released since 2020: YATI, Nanku Sharma and Jaadui Ghadi.   On ‘
Milansaar ’, the title track off his new EP, he is cheeky in his Hinglish lyrics: “
Adaa so lit, tujhe karu commit / Tujhe dekh yeh mann ashcharyachakit / Teri palkon se vichlit, futuristic  /
Har gaana tera hit .” With shining sense of experimentation, Udbhav is well on his way to break out of the capital’s hip-hop scene.
 Sound: A dash of dancehall into pop, R&B and jazz leanings
   Sample this: ‘
You Don’t Have To ’, a real-talk takedown of insecurities and superficialities in relationships, with a music video that draws from the ‘plastic’ world of doll houses
  Hyderabad-based singer-songwriter Peekay aka Pranati Khanna, 25, has spent a few years with indie rock band The Ragamuffins (who later christened themselves Spell Check), but she’s put her best foot forward with her solo material since 2020. With refreshingly candid takes on matters of the heart and mind (‘
Good Old Fashioned in Love ’ featuring rapper Aishan Vali, ‘
Much Better ’ and ‘
You Don’t Have To ’), her music is exactly the kind of
vibrant we need.
   Her upcoming single, ‘
Sunshine on the Street ’ calls on Shillong-bred actor/singer Andrea Tariang for a jam about understanding and respecting the LGBTQIA+ community. Also a visual designer and artist, Peekay is Khanna’s outlet for channelling her inner Ella Fitzgerald to reggae and pop-rock influences.
 Sound: Swirling electronic-pop that also flits between multiple genres, ranging from folk to trip-hop to rock
   Sample this: ‘
L.I.I.T ’, driven by fist-tight basslines, chopped up rhythms and airy vocals that pull in several directions, exciting at every turn
  Between themselves, Goa-based siblings Belinda, 28, and Brandon Mendes, 29, play piano, keyboard, guitar, and violin, and sing and produce their music. Electronic music remains the wider field of play, but there’s so much more going on — their 2020 debut single ‘
Flip-Side ’ is like a dramatic story told with campfire jam-like flair, while ‘
Multicolored Dreams ’ unwinds with psych-rock flourishes.
   Last year, Merak’s composition ‘
Time-Travelling Soul ’, a piano-led piece that brings in gargantuan bass elements, won the Platinum Track of the Year in the electronic music category at the India Film Project’s 50 Hour Music Challenge competition. With their new single ‘
Pluto Town ’ bringing in jazz guitar and string arrangements, the duo is covering a whole spectrum like few other indie artists.
 Sound: Rock, Kashmiri folk and an occasionally infectious sense of groove
  Sample this: ‘
Dazaan ’, a wiry 2020 collaboration with rappers Ahmer and Straight Outta Srinagar, raising a clarion call for artists and Kashmiris to persist against naysayers
  Kashmiri singer-songwriter Ali Saffudin, 29, centres his music around resistance, but also delves on spirituality and often reflects on life minus the glare that the world focusses towards his land. With an earthen, rustic voice of a troubadour, Saffudin combines Kashmiri folk melodies and guitar virtuoso on ‘
Asaan Gindaan ’, but brings an intimacy to his album
Home Recordings (Vol. 1).
   He roars with power on ‘
The Spring Song ’, but is measured with melodies on Kashmiri folk renditions like ‘
Karyo Maz Jigras ’. Signed to Mumbai-based Azadi Records, Saffudin’s studio full-length album is expected this year, packing in stories of the beauty, importance and persistence of Kashmiri lives.

1045,"February 12, 2022",20:35 IST,entertainment,music,"Satish Sharma and Meeta Pandit release ‘Naina Milaike’, a Valentine’s Day song"," Guitarist and classical musician Satish Sharma collaborated with renowned classical vocalist Meeta Pandit to release a song ‘Naina Milaike’ to mark Valentine’s Day.  The semi-classical melodious track based on raga Jhinjhoti is rendered by Meeta with a touch of Baul vocals by Satish.  “ ‘Naina Milaike’ is the depiction of Meera Bai’s complete surrender to Lord Krishna,” says Satish who conceived the idea of this song while practising Jhinjhoti on his guitar. “I consider all my compositions a gift from the almighty,” he adds. Having collaborated earlier with Meeta in recording a few songs, Satish felt her voice would be perfect for this composition and roped her in. The video was shot at picturesque locales of Ajmer in Rajasthan.  Music beyond genre Recalling her experience of recording the song, Meeta who has gone beyond her classical forte to render this song says, “Music is music. If you are a performer, you would want your music to reach out to the audience through all kinds of genres.” ‘Naina Milaike’ is also dedicated to people who suffered hardships during the pandemic, especially families who stayed apart in different places. “Lovers were separated, aged parents were stranded in different parts of the world due to the lockdown. People have lost their loved ones without being able to say goodbye. The song is about yearning for your loved ones and expressing the unconditional love you feel for them,” she says. Meeta belongs to the Gwalior Gharana and is the sixth in the unbroken lineage and the first woman in the family to take up music professionally. Becoming a professional performer was not a smooth journey for Meeta, though singing came naturally to her. Her father, Laxman Krishnarao Pandit, wanted her to pursue her academics and his son, Tushar Pandit, to carry forward the music legacy. The untimely demise of Tushar in 1994 changed things and Meeta eventually took to the stage and made her family proud by becoming one of the country’s foremost vocalists. “Change is inevitable. We can now enjoy a choice in our music – a privilege earlier artists did not have. A wise artist will learn the best from his guru but not copy him,” says Meeta. Ga ga over guitar Satish Sharma’s roots in Rajasthan and his love for Hindustani ragas combine to make him a great composer but his first love is the guitar and he adds a new dimension to the ragas while strumming on the nylon strings of his guitar. “I prefer playing the nylon string guitar as the sound is quite smooth and well rounded, and the dynamics are perfect for my style of playing,” says Satish who has recently developed a guitar called ‘Sapt guitar’, which is a fretless, nylon seven-string guitar.   Satish had composed music for television serials, a few Bollywood films and jingles. His recent albums are
Love Songs on Guitar (Vol. 1 &2) ,
Ragas on Guitar’ and
Morning Bliss’, Ek Tu, and Su
fi Strings. “ To give expression to my thoughts, I started writing lyrics, composing music. Eventually, I started singing and that gives me a lot of satisfaction.”

1046,"February 11, 2022",21:15 IST,entertainment,music,Lata Mangeshkar’s connect with the Carnatic world,"  That she was the ‘nightingale of India’ is well known, but not much is known about her rapport with Carnatic musicians. The first interaction was probably courtesy the gramophone. A biographical sketch of Dwaram Venkataswami Naidu in one of the early issues of
Sruti magazine talks about how the legendary violinist was in praise of Lata Mangeshkar’s fidelity to pitch and purity of note. He would ask his disciples to listen to her records and emulate these traits. He was not alone in this observation. According to Carnatic music aficionado K.S.S Rajan, the late Voleti Venkateswarulu too was an ardent admirer.
 With some Carnatic musicians, Lata shared a close bond, starting with K.B. Sundarambal. The two had several common threads in their life stories — losing their father at a young age and boldly taking on the family’s responsibility. Both were always clad in white.  In Pa. Chozhanadan’s biography of K.B. Sundarambal (Kodumudi Kokilam KB Sundarambal Varalaru, Rishabham Pathippagam, 2002), there is a lovely photograph of the two together. 
Lata with K.B. Sundrarambal
 
  The story behind the photograph, as narrated by Chozhanadan, is that Lata having arrived in Madras shortly after the release of Gemini’sAvvaiyar, was taken to see the film. She was stunned by KBS’ vocal prowess and when they met, she ran her fingers down the latter’s throat saying she wanted to feel the cords that had sung such songs. She then desired to have a photo taken with KBS and it was fulfilled by Vaidy, a photographer from Carnatic Studio at Mount Road/Patullos Road corner. After returning to Bombay, Lata sent a letter to S.S. Vasan of Gemini Studios, under whose banner and direction the film was made. In it, she writes that she considers the film a fitting outcome of Vasan’s love for music and devotion to god. She also speaks of how her eyes welled up when she watched KBS sing and act as Avvai. “When great artistes sing, we get to see their devotion to the art and the extent of their years of practice. If I had been Ganesha, I would forever be singing the praises of this devotee. I have no other words to express my respect for Smt. K.B. Sundarambal.” (Translated by me from Chozhanadan’s book in Tamil.) M.S. Subbulakshmi was yet another singer whom Lata venerated. She used to say that she rarely missed a concert of hers when she performed in Bombay. There are several photographs of the two together — from the early ones, where a clearly star-struck Lata is calling at Kalki Gardens to the later ones, where the two are in animated conversation. Most music-lovers would have wished to be a fly on the wall and listen to what the two nightingales discussed.  In 1994, the Deenanath Mangeshkar award, instituted by Lata in memory of her father, was conferred on MS. In a recent interview, the latter’s grandson, V. Srinivasan, has spoken of how MS could not go to Bombay to receive the award and so Lata flew into Madras to present it.  In 1986, Lata Mangeshkar was the chief guest at Sri Krishna Gana Sabha to commemorate violin maestro Lalgudi G Jayaraman’s 50th solo performance, where both MS and M.L.Vasanthakumari were present.  “In the 1960s, Lataji became a great admirer of my father’s music after she heard his LP record of Tyagaraja’s ‘Nadasudharambilanu’ (Arabhi/Rupakam). She attended his performances in Bombay and also felicitated him on one such occasion.  She invited my father and his sister, Srimathi Brahmanandam, to perform together. He also visited her house at her invitation. Once when my father, my sister Vijayalakshmi, and I were in London to perform at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Lataji came and stayed till the end,” recalls Lalgudi G.J.R. Krishnan. Last year, at Music Academy’s virtual conference, scholar and writer Lalitharam gave a presentation on nagaswaram maestro Karukuruchi Arunachalam. He spoke of Lata’s admiration for the artiste.  On one occasion, when she attended his concert in Bombay, he played impromptu her song, ‘Yeh zindagi usi ki hai’ from the film Anarkali (1953). Lalitharam also shared the YouTube link of the recording.   Lastly, did Lata ever sing in the Carnatic style? There are at least three instances — all equally delightful. The first is Salil Chowdhury’s tribute to Muthuswami Dikshitar and his ‘Vatapi Ganapatim’ (Hamsadhvani/Adi) through his song ‘Ja tose nahin boloon Kanhaiya’, sung by Lata and Manna Dey, with lyrics by Shailendra, in the 1956 film, Parivar. In the film Pardesi, a 1957 Indo-Soviet collaboration, Lata sang the Hindi version of Ramanathapuram Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar’s Shankarabharanam/Adi Tillana to which Padmini danced. Music director Anil Biswas adapted it with lyrics by Ali Sardar Jafri and Prem Dhawan. According to scholar Ritha Rajan, even the 1957 Suvarna Sundari ragamalika, ‘Kuhu kuhu bole koyaliya’ set in Sohni (Hamsanandi), Bahar, Jaunpuri and Yaman (Kalyani) by Adi Narayana Rao (lyrics by Bharat Vyas) is heavily in the Carnatic mode, especially its suite of swaras. There may be more. There was clearly much give and take and a lot of mutual admiration between Lata and the Carnatic world.

1047,"February 10, 2022",18:10 IST,entertainment,music,Shraddha presented an appealing Kiravani," Shraddha Ravindran’s solo violin recital for Kala Prashala on Facebook was quite impressive. Her opening piece, ‘Sri Saraswathi’ in sprightly Arabhi (Dikshitar—rupakam), was a serene rendition. The swift swaraprastara at the pallavi enhanced the appeal of the thematic concert presented as part of Vasant Panchami. Shraddha learnt from Radha Sundaresan and Sembanarkoil S.R.D. Vaidyanathan. The young violinist is presently training under veteran A. Kanyakumari. The marked vocal style, the effective gamakas, the extended bowing, and lyrical familiarity — all hallmarks of Kanyakumari — were reflected in her performance.  In Syama Sastri’s Bhairavi swarajati on Kamakshi, Shraddha played both the swara and sahitya segments clearly, bringing out the distinctive aspects. A neat elucidation of raga Mohana Kalyani preceded Harikesanallur Muthiah Bhagavatar’s ‘Bhuvaneswariya’. A string of swift kalpanaswaras at the pallavi brought out the essence of this charming raga. The central piece of the concert was Papanasam Sivan’s ‘Devi neeye thunai’ in Kiravani, themed on Devi. With an exhaustive alapana, Shraddha brought out the beauty of the raga in every phrase. There was a plethora of sangathis in the niraval and the swaraprastara was at charanam, ‘Malayadhwajan maadhavame’. Madurai Srinivasan’s ‘Karunai deivame’ on Mylai Karpagambal, and Purandaradasa’s ‘Venkatachala nilayam’, both in raga Sindhu Bhairavi, were the tailenders. The latter was played on request from a Facebook rasika.   I was a bit sceptical at the beginning of the solo concert, as the young violinist was going to perform without any accompaniment. But she proved her mettle with a versatile presentation. The Chennai-based reviewer specialises in Carnatic music.",H.

1048,"February 10, 2022",18:10 IST,entertainment,music,How Lata Mangeshkar drew deeply from classical music," Many musicians have held sway over the collective Indian consciousness, but Lata Mangeshkar’s magic spanned six generations with a career that lasted seven decades. Was it her voice? Flawless diction? Classicism? Or emotion? These attributes describe some aspects of her music, but to codify her music in such easy descriptions would be to undervalue it.  Often, the femininity factor has been invoked. Lata’s voice was that of the ‘ideal Indian woman’, said theorists. Nearly six years after her debut, Lata took the Hindi film industry by storm in 1949 with the film
Barsaat . Did this happen in the absence of the other phenomenal singers of those times? Noor Jahan had moved to Pakistan, but Shamshad Begum, Amirbai Karnataki, Suraiya and Surinder Kaur were still singing.
 “What was special about Lata’s voice?” asks film music critic Ashok Kumar Tyagi in his essay on Lata Mangeshkar (2010), and goes on to say, “Let us ask what was special about the voice of Noorjehan, Shamshad, Geeta Dutt or Asha Bhosle. Now this is easy to answer. Every one of them had something very distinct that suited a particular genre. Someone had a deep-throated voice, a nasal twang or full voice, some had a vivacious voice... But Lata’s was pure music.” Indeed, various writers have noted how Lata’s ultra-feminine voice was considered to better suit the idea of womanhood being constructed in the years after Independence than the sensuous, deep or vivacious voices that preceded her.  Yet, when you listen to the wonderful song composed by Naushad for the film,
Aan (1952), a duet by Shamshad Begum and Lata Mangeshkar, you neither get a sense of augmented nor diminished femininity in either of their voices. As Ashok Kumar says, they are beautiful with their own strengths. Perhaps the ‘ideal Indian woman’s voice’ argument also lacks force because one can list so many of Lata’s stunning renditions that were not so. ‘Yeh kahan aagaye hum’ from
Silsila  could be one example.
 Any such search will only end up equating a good voice with good music. But Lata’s success did not come from her voice alone. The 1940s to 1970s was the golden period of film music. Lata became the voice that carried diverse traditions, imaginations and geniuses — C. Ramachandra, Shrinivas Kale from Maharashtra, Anil Biswas, S.D. Burman from Bengal, Madan Mohan from Punjab, Dhaniram, Naushad from Uttar Pradesh, Lakshman Berlekar, Khayyam and Roshan. Her film music repertoire was enriched by khayal, thumri, ghazal, bhavgeet, abhang, bhajan, and pop. But to each of these genres she brought the seriousness and rigour of classical music. Lata hailed from a family of classical musicians. Her paternal grandmother Yesubai, a devadasi, had the reputation of being an impeccable musician. Her father Deenanath Mangeshkar was trained under the Gwalior maestro Ramakrishna Bua Vaze. Lata was not only put through the rigours of classical music by her father, she also took lessons from Ustad Aman Ali Khan of Bhendibazar gharana. In her early years, she sang and acted in theatre. With such a legacy, it is little surprise that her singing was chaste and perfect but with an element of drama when needed. Most importantly, her accuracy of scale and pitch was exemplary. “The voice was not only perfectly pitched, it was also steeped in musicality,” says Shubha Mudgal.  Lata sang a lot of classical-based film songs. ‘Aaja aaja bhanwar’ from
Rani Rupamati  ( 1957, raag Brindavan Sarang) is an excellent example. The opening note of the song is the upper octave rishabha and mimics a drut bandish. The bandish flows into fast-paced boltaans which, in turn, flow into the climax that ends in the fourth octave. ‘Sanware Sanware’ from
Anuradha (1960, raag Bhairavi) is another. Composed by Pt. Ravi Shankar, it is a breezy composition that opens in the third octave in the pancham swar, and has short, arrow-like taans, packed into a tight rhythm framework. ‘Mana Mohana’ from
 Seema  (1955, raag Jaijaivanti) shows that she could slip into raga elaborations and brilliant taans like a proper classical performer. ‘Cham cham nachat aayi bahar” from the film
 Chhaya  (1961) is both a raagmala and talamala. “She could have been another Kesaribai Kerkar or Kishori Amonkar had she chosen to be a classical singer, but compulsions of life took her to film music,” says Pt. Vinayak Torvi.
 As debates on the versatility and femininity of her voice continue, Lata’s music still holds sway over millions, imbued with the mystery of the unknowable. There was surrender in her music and there was perfection. And that is an irresistible combination.

1049,"February 10, 2022",18:08 IST,entertainment,music,T.M. Krishna explores every shade of Surutti," A concert that has just one big piece in one raga is a tricky experiment. At some point, the sameness could get tiresome, unless the rendition style is attractive or the artiste uncovers new paradigms. Measured against this, T.M. Krishna’s concert, the last in ARTery’s Magnum Opus series dedicated to maestro T.N. Krishnan, was successful for the most part. Surutti has a naturally endowed beauty and solemnity, and lends itself to myriad expansive opportunities. In his raga alapana, Krishna deployed very short to short phrases, uncovering the lakshanas one by one, like a flower unfurling one petal at a time. As he lingered on notes or a micro string of notes, his aesthetic interpretation and ladder-like structure was a treat to the ears. One was reminded of maestro Rajarathnam Pillai, who would play a Thodi or a Shanmukhapriya alapana for a few hours, sometimes through the night, holding his audience captive. Krishna’s effort was not as prodigious but left no aspect unexplored either. Shriram Kumar’s own forays were equally gentle and progressive, matching syllable for syllable. ‘Geetharthamu sangeethanandamu’ is a kriti in praise of Rama (indirectly) and of Hanuman, who understood the greatness of Rama and served him. Tyagaraja equates the essence of Bhagavad Gita to musical bliss, a powerful simile. Krishna’s slow-paced treatment allowed for full enjoyment of the lyrics, without hustle or distortion. A well-rendered kriti is always a delight. Niraval was initiated at the unusual ‘Vara Tyagaraja’ spot. This is where the ‘sameness’ struck the listener, as the meandering sangatis produced a sense of deja vu. The brisker version of the niraval and swaras (at ‘Sangeethanandamu’) brought some relief.  The phrase ‘ma pa da pa’ in Surutti is deployed for a fleeting flavour, as it perhaps has no classical origin or has a lakshana conflict. Krishna not only indulged in it much longer, he liberated the panchamam from its slot at times — creative lesions, if you will.  Shriram Kumar revels in such rakti ragas, rendering them at leisurely pace that augment the pleasure, and he contributed to the sweet sounds, especially in the raga alapana and in some swara ideas, including a tranquil ascend to the upper shadjam when Arun Prakash let him go solo.  It is a challenge to be inactive for a long time and then to play at about half the normal speed, but Arun Prakash is the quintessential co-artiste who blends into all situations, without craving undue attention through sound production. His thani was equally serene and crafty. Krishna is a musician who is at ease in all situations, tempos and time-spans. The ability to sustain melody, artistry and sruti in ultra-vilamba courses is now his emblem, as this concert showed.  Eka kriti concert, by whatever name it is called, is a good thought that may be interesting for some deep listeners. It is, perhaps, out of sync with the larger audience, who ideally prefer a bundle of flavours in a concert.

1051,"February 10, 2022",17:20 IST,entertainment,music,The Mangeshkar sisters and Marathi music,"  For the Mangeshkar sisters, Lata and Asha Bhosle, life was not always easy. Although they were the inheritors of their father Master Deenanath Mangeshkar’s rich musical legacy, his untimely death in 1942 made the family financially insecure. The family responsibility fell on a young Lata, who at the age of 13 sang her first Marathi song in the film
Pahili Mangalagaur.  Asha debuted in the Marathi film,
Mazha Bal , aged 10.
 Although they began their musical journey in movies, what fascinates me as a music composer is their contribution to non-film music, especially in Marathi. It is of great cultural significance that the sisters kept exploring their roots despite soaring high in the film industry. While they sang in almost all Indian languages, their contribution to Marathi has been seminal.  
Lata Mangeshkar (L) with her brother Hridaynath Mangeshkar.  Deenanath Mangeshkar was an actor-singer who, like the legendary Marathi singer Bal Gandharva, started his career in music and theatre at Kirloskar Natak Mandali aged 11. A disciple of Pt. Ramkrishnabuva Vaze, a luminary of the Gwalior gharana, Deenanath later started a theatre company called Balwant Natak Mandali. He had the blessings of renowned Marathi poet-playwright Ram Ganesh Gadkari, whose plays
Punyaprabhav and
Bhavbandhan were performed by Deenanath.
  Deenanath was a prolific singer and, in style, a great contrast to Bal Gandharva and other contemporaries. Equally, Deenanath’s plays were progressive, with a nationalist sentiment. The plays were written by some of the best literary minds of the time like Veer Vamanrao Joshi (
Ranadundubhi ) and Ram Ganesh Gadkari (
Punyaprabhav ). Music was the mainstay of the Marathi theatrical tradition, and Natyasangeet as a genre derives its roots from the keertan parampara of Maharashtrian and Hindustani music.
  Asha sang a lot of natyasangeet in the early days of her career and the vinyl of
Manaapman (musical play by K. P. Khadilkar) is testimony. She has recreated her father’s magic by singing natyapadas like ‘Yuvati manaa daarun rana’ or ‘Chandrika hi janu’. I still remember her performance one wintry night in Raja Shivaji Vidyalaya grounds in Dadar, where she sang ‘Paravashata paash daive’ by Veer Wamanrao Joshi with almost no accompaniment. The song, written in the pre-Independence era, speaks of how we were slaves in our own land.
  The Mangeshkar sisters sang Veer Savarkar’s ‘Sagara pran talmalala’, a result of the family’s devotion to Savarkar’s nationalism. Savarkar wrote
Sanyasta Khadga for Deenanath.
 It is my observation that Lata looked at film music as a profession, but her non-film music was about who she really was. The kind of music she chose to create in Marathi tells you a lot more about the legend than any biographical article could.   The tradition of singing Marathi poetry started almost parallel to Marathi film music, which began with V. Shantaram’s
Ayodhyecha Raja . In 1932, G.N. Joshi composed and sang N.G. Deshpande’s poem ‘Raanaa raanaat geli bai sheel’ for HMV, sowing the seeds of Marathi non-film music. Gajananrao Watve sang the poems of Manmohan, Anil, and Kavi Yashwant to full houses.
 The tradition of composing poetry and metamorphosing them into songs continued with composers like Vasant Prabhu, Shrinivas Khale and later, Hridaynath Mangeshkar, whose compositions were sung by Lata and Asha. Hridaynath not only set to music lyrical poems but also those that were not meant to be sung, such as Arti Prabhu, Manik Godghate (Grace), B.R. Tambe, and Kavi B’s poems. This introduced some of the finest Marathi poetry to people who would otherwise be apathetic to literature. They started humming even complex and abstruse poems, sung by the sisters.   Another significant contribution, especially by Lata, is her rendition of Sant Sahitya, the compositions by Maharashtra’s saint poets.
Abhang Tukayache , the poetry of Saint Tukaram, composed by Shrinivas Khale, took Maharashtra by storm. ‘Bheti laagi jeeva’, ‘Anandache dohi’, ‘Vrukshavalli aamha soyare’, ‘Sundar te dhyaan’ are some songs from this album that are still sung.
  Hridaynath brought to life Sant Dnyaneshwar’s poetry from his works,
Dnyaneshwari and
Amrutanubhav . To this day, when you hear ‘Mogara phulala’ or ‘Ghanu vaaje ghunaghuna’ in Lata’s voice, it stirs you. The purity and perfection of her singing conveyed the divinity contained in the words. When you listen to Lata singing ‘Pasaayadaan’, Sant Dnyaneshwar’s prayer where he asks for the fulfilment of wishes of every living being, you experience a sense of peace.
 From bhavageet to koligeet to abhang and ghazal, the sisters covered multiple genres. Their singing stirs the imagination. When Lata sings Grace’s poem, ‘Bhaya ithale sampat nahi’ or the Koligeet ‘Raaja saarangaa, maajhya saaranga’, you not only hear the song, you experience it. When Asha sings the lines by Shanta Shelke, ‘Jeevalaga raahile re door ghar maazhe,’ you travel with the poet. In the 1980s, when television eclipsed radio and we saw a dearth of good non-film music in Marathi, it was Asha’s album Rutu Hirva, with poetry by the likes of Shanta Shelke and B.B. Borkar and composed by Shreedhar Phadke, that provided a lifeline. Today, if children sing the poems of Borkar, Grace, Arti Prabhu and Suresh Bhat in Marathi music reality shows, the Mangeshkar sisters should be credited for keeping that rich legacy alive.

The script explores modern-day relationships in an urban setting, and it was quite inspiring to be a part of it as a lyricist,” he says.  Ankur was supervising the music for
Gehraiyaan and while making the teaser for the film, he decided to use the song ‘Frontline’ by OAFF, which was in English and rendered by singer Lothika Jha. Ankur penned the Hindi lyrics and made Lothika sing the Hindi version as well. “The film is about giving in to temptation, knowing that it is not going to work. That is pretty much how these words fell into place. ‘You are my medicine, and you are my ailment and yet I give in to it.”’
 A campus as a catalyst  Ankur has been part of the music industry for well over two decades and his band Ankur & The Ghalat Family that he formed in 2009 brought out some fun-filled independent music. However, Bollywood sat up and noticed Ankur only after he supervised the 18-track music in Zoya Akhtar’s
Gully Boy in 2019. “Life is, I feel, a series of successes and failures and people end up noticing the successes. But failure is what makes you...
Gully Boy  was a good moment of success, which is important from time to time. And sometimes when you get successful, people dig into the past and check out your earlier work. So, it is exciting.”
 Ankur’s childhood, spent in Roorkee near Dehradun. was a catalyst to his artistic pursuits. “I grew up on campus, my father was a professor in the university which is now an IIT. My mother used to direct plays. So, the house was kind of an open house. There was a lot of music and art and culture around me. I was privileged to be surrounded by a lot of artists, actors, poets, writers. It was quite fortunate for me to have had such a beautiful childhood,” he says, adding “My family always supported my decisions in terms of whatever I was doing.” Lessons from life Stating that he never went to a film or music school, Ankur says, “I am driven by curiosity, stories, people and incidents.” He likens his life to being in a “a university where each of the projects is like a new semester. They end up teaching you about various styles on how different people approach stories and life. It is quite inspiring.”  Soon after
Gully Boy came the pandemic and while admitting that it was hard, Ankur says it was a time to introspect and recalibrate. “A lot of writing, thinking, and reading happened. It was not an easy time for any artist...” says Ankur. “But, the artists helped each other. Those who are doing well for themselves helped the ones who were still trying to find a foothold.”

At this, the now-26-year-old hitmaker chuckles, and opts to stay grateful about his career so far.

You can subscribe for free here While on a call from Dubai, Armaan can sense new vistas in his music career, marked by his latest single ‘You’; the song’s music video was filmed in the City Of Love – checking off Armaan’s bucket list – and the overall atmosphere of the song is more introspective, unlike his usual uptempo and dance-friendly vibe. “I wanted to offer something different when I started music for an English number,” he says, “so for ‘You’, I could channel my need to do a love ballad.” The song, using largely guitar, empowers a new range of his vocals: softer, huskier and more calming. Armaan had received the demo for the track from long-time collaborator and LA-based musician Natania Lalwani and producer Jack Edwards. The team built the song through virtual sessions but it worked well. “The song is a concoction of what we were all feeling about ‘first love’, and we wanted it to feel like a page out of everyone’s life-book,” he recalls. “In the past few weeks that it has been out, I’ve seen the response. But obviously, there is still a lifetime for the song to do what it sets out to, which is bringing people together.” When Armaan Malik was in Paris for the Paris Fashion Week in October 2021, he and his team seized the opportunity to film for ‘You’. “It was a no-brainer,” he recalls, “and the fall aesthetics of the video added to the intimate song as well.”

Did you (literally) hear? Apple has finally rolled out new Lossless Audio and Spatial Audio technologies While melody and lyrics are a priority for Armaan, he is also keen on leveraging the right technology. Gone are the times of passive listening; people want to fully engage with all layers of a track. “Whenever I’m in the studio, apart from my usual job of singing, I’m also part of the music-making which comprises the arrangement, during which we make enhancements such as reverbs and delays we incorporate during production,” he explains. “For ‘You’, Apple Music’s Spatial Audio and Dolby Atmos translate these nuances so that fans can immerse themselves in a song.” He expresses similar sentiments in a recent interview with Apple Music Radio’s Brooke Reese, where he was the first Indian musician to feature on the show that reaches more than 100 countries. The past two and a half years have been tough on musicians and Armaan empathises with those who have not been able to reap the rewards of a live music scene.  Also Read |
Armaan Malik on the viral success of ‘Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo’ song ‘Butta Bomma’  Despite a fair amount of success over the past few years owing to
Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo ’s ‘Butta Bomma’ that went viral and
his dubbing work for the Hindi version of Guy Ritchie’s 2019 live-acton film ‘Aladdin’ , he admits that his mental health took a hit. “For a long time, I was feeling very low, not knowing when I’d be able to put a song or video out and whether I would be able to play it live. And it is a chain reaction: I have a band that depends on me for my shows; if I’m not playing a show, they’re not getting paid for it.”
 But he explains that adaption is the key to moving forward, “This is our livelihood and though we feel good while doing it, we all have bills to pay. So many musicians depend on live gigs and studio shows and they have been forced to move to a new medium. Those who have found a way to make it profitable have benefitted but that’s not everyone. But the only way to cope with this is to realise that life is headed towards a digital age.” Now with more Indian musicians like Ritviz and Daler Mehndi moving into the metaverse space with virtual concerts and NFTs, Armaan – who admits he is not well-versed about these emerging technologies – shares he may have to learn how it all works simply because that is where the world is heading. Alongside the complexities of tech, Armaan believes emerging and veteran musicians should know how to navigate the contentious music streaming industry. “Getting the art right is first,” he states, “and the second is educating yourself with the business side of this industry. Having worked with both labels and independently, I would suggest all musicians own their music; even if you make a dollar or two, that is yours – and this is empowering. Many have not been able to do this because when you grow in your career, you need this support from labels and others in the industry… and now we are seeing more musicians break that rule, by creating something on their own from scratch.” He adds, “Many do not understand the revenue model of streaming sites and other ways to make money from their songs. There are so many ways to access this information. A few years ago, many Indian musicians could not reach international audiences without streaming services [like Gaana, Apple Music or Spotify]. While there are many explainers on YouTube and such on this topic, I do wish there were more portals in India, educating people about how to monetise their original music.”",Divya Kala Bhavani,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/armaan-malik-interview-2022-you-song-apple-music/article38400757.ece

Especially during Lockdown 2.0 and 2.1. Videos of him doing a lip sync to Bollywood music, while educating and entertaining social media regulars on physical distancing, right mask usage, other COVID-19 safety protocols and vaccination were shared by many of his 917k Insta followers. Apart from his regular videos, ones, Abhijeet has also made some videos on the Omicron variant.  The 26-year-old content creator from Lucknow says, “My Instagram becoming what it is now, is a lockdown miracle. I call myself an extroverted introvert; so I’m very selectively social., but when I started creating content I felt as though a new part of me was acting in front of the camera. I’m grateful my audience was so kind and encouraging; that kept me going.” A degree holder in animation and acting, Abhijeet, who was popular on TikTok before it was banned in India, would like to be known as an artist more than an actor. Considering how apt is his choice of music to go with the situation he discusses on Reels, one assumes he’s a die-hard Bollywood fan. But he is not. He explains, “My content has always been based on music, I am not so much a Bollywood movies fan as much as I am a fan of Bollywood music. The COVID-19 safety videos I’ve made are more of public service announcements (PSA). I wish for the audience to relate to my content but at the same time learn something from it.” Talking about the characters he plays, Abhijeet uses a T-shirt for hair when portraying a female role and he says it was the audience who made him stick to it after he tried it once. “When I initially started creating content, I wanted to be able to play more characters but it was becoming increasingly difficult to do so without props. Once I started using this t-shirt, my audience loved it so much that it became a staple. I have started to use wigs now but yet, the T-shirt has a separate fan base,” he laughs. He shoots all his videos from a single spot at his home in Lucknow. The reason being, “it is about good lighting but it’s also about familiarity, it brings continuity to the page. I’ve just very recently started experimenting with my content and I hope my audience enjoys watching it as much as I have enjoyed creating it.”",Prabalika M Borah,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/abhijeet-kain-contect-creator-from-india/article38396148.ece

The legendary singer, who passed away aged 92 in Mumbai on Sunday, chose the UK venue for her debut on the international stage in 1974 where she performed some of her most loved melodies to a packed audience. “This is my first concert outside India. I was quite nervous, but I am grateful for the warm reception,” she said in her brief speech in Hindi. During the course of the show, she shared her memories of singing with her Bollywood contemporaries, such as Kishore Kumar and Hemant Kumar, and performing with leading musicians, such as S.D. Burman and Naushad. She displayed a quirky sense of humour as she shared anecdotes with the audience. The sell-out concert was introduced by actor Dilip Kumar, whom she referred to as her brother “Yusuf Bhai”. “Just as the fragrance of a flower has no colour, just as flowing water or the breeze have no boundaries, and just as the rays of the sun have no religious divide, the voice of Lata Mangeshkar is just such a miracle of nature,” said Kumar, or Yusuf Khan, in his famous introductory speech in Urdu, before he encouraged the audience to welcome the singer on stage with resounding applause. The concert, which remains one of the late singer’s rare performances with a live orchestra, was organised in aid of the Nehru Memorial Fund, set up to bestow fellowships in memory of India’s first Prime Minister. The show covered Mangeshkar's biggest Bollywood hits over the decades, including ‘Aaja Re Pardesi’ from ‘Madhumati’, ‘Inhin Logon Ne’ from ‘Pakeezah’ and ‘Aayega Aanewala’ from ‘Mahal’. The recording from the live show, set in two volumes of long-playing records (LPs), went on to sell more than 133,000 copies.  Royal Albert Hall, inaugurated in 1871 by Queen Victoria in memory of her late husband Prince Albert, is one of the UK's premier concert venues which has played host to world-famous artists over the years. It forms part of Albert Memorial at Kensington Gardens in central London and also hosts important sporting events and award ceremonies. ""The world’s leading figures in music, dance, sport and politics have appeared on our stage since we opened in 1871, and now over 1.7 million people enjoy live experiences here every year, with millions more experiencing our events through broadcasts, recordings and new media channels,"" according to the website of the Royal Albert Hall.

When they joined hands — which, fortunately, was very often — the result was sheer magic. Lata Mangeshkar and Madan Mohan together gave Hindi cinema some of its sweetest songs ever. Hugely successful collaborations between composers and singers are not unusual in Indian cinema. It’s as if the composers reserve their best for their favourite voices — although that’s increasingly less frequent these days, when music isn’t as indispensable an ingredient in our cinema as it used to be. We have had fruitful partnerships like Naushad-Mohammed Rafi, R.D. Burman-Kishore Kumar, O.P. Nayyar-Asha Bhosle, Ilaiyaraja-S.P. Balasubrahmanyam, M.S. Viswanathan-P. Susheela, M.S. Baburaj-S.

Music fans may be divided when it comes to choosing their favourite male singers – some might swear by Mohammed Rafi, others by Kishore Kumar, and some others by K.J. Yesudas or S.P. Balasubrahmanyam– but the majority of them may pick Lata as the female voice they most want to listen to. Not without reason. Her voice was heavenly, her range wide and her expressions always so right. And she was incapable of singing out of tune. Little wonder, the leading heroines of the day insisted in their contracts that the songs picturised on them would be rendered by Lata. She was nearly always the first choice for the composer even otherwise. Here is rewinding to some of the unforgettable songs by India’s favourite voice: Lag jaa gale...(Woh Kaun Thi?) There cannot be too many more popular Indian songs than this one. Because there cannot be too many better songs.  This haunting melody for the 1964 film was composed by Madan Mohan, the genius whose muse Lata was. It is so beautiful, you will
never want to stop listening to it . Many singers have attempted covers of this classic but failed to capture the soul of the song the way Lata did.
  Raja Mehdi Ali Khan’s lyrics – meaning:
Come, hug me one more time/ This lovely night may not come again – also played a part in making the song immortal.
 Mohe panghat pe...(Mughal-E-Azam) K. Asif’s magnum opus had just about everything. A splendid script, an excellent cast led by Prithviraj Kapoor, Dilip Kumar and Madhubala, beautiful costumes and art design, graceful choreography... A film like that deserved an outstanding musical score, too. Naushad provided that. Pyaar kiya to darna kyaa... may be the most popular Lata song from the album, but
this one is probably the pick for its sweet innocence and the way Lat lent her emotions.
 Chalte chalte...(Pakeezah)  Director Kamal Amrohi’s epic tribute to his wife Meena Kumari is still celebrated for the gifted actress’s superb performance in her last film and an
out-of-the-world musical score put jointly together by Ghulam Mohammed and Naushad. The entire album was dipping with honey, with several timeless melodies, like
Inhi logon ne... ,
Thaade rahiyo.. .,
Chal dildaar chalo. ..., and
Mausam hai aashiqaana. .., but this one probably pips them all.
 Ae dil e naadaan...(Razia Sultan)   
  Khayyam may have made Asha Bhosle sing most of the songs in his magnum opus
Umrao Jaan , but for this achingly beautiful song, he turned to the eldest of the talented Mangeshkar sisters. Lata‘s soulful rendition made it one of the best songs of the 1980’s.
 O sajna barkha bahaar...(Parakh)  Perhaps
Salil Choudhary’s best song for Lata (though it may not be as popular as the Madhumati song,
Aaja re pardesi. ..). It is from the 1960 Bimal Roy film, the story of which was also written by the music director. The song remains one of the finest composed in raga Khamaj.
 Aayega aanewaala...(Mahal)   
 This was one of her earliest hits and still one of the best, seven decades after it was recorded. A 20-year-old Lata gave glimpses of how she could hold a nation spellbound with her voice. A brilliant composition by Khemchand Prakash and beautifully visualised – especially for a 1949 film – by Kamal Amrohi. Satyam shivam sundaram...(Satyam Shivam Sundaram) Still the song the aspiring Lata Mangeshkars opt for to impress the audience . They all get applause – and some of them overnight fame, too – when they attempt what is certainly not an easy song to render.
  A masterly composition, in raga
Darbari Kanada , by Laxmikant Pyarelal for a film which is said to have been inspired by Lata‘s voice. Director Raj Kapoor, apparently, even wanted her to act in the role, which was eventually made famous by Zeenat Aman.
 Raina beeti jaaye...(Amar Prem)   
  R.D. Burman’s unforgettable score for the Shakti Samanta film contained two of Kishore Kumar’s finest songs –-
Chingaari koibhadke... and
Kuch to log kehenge... This song by Lata doesn’t pale in comparison at all.
  This exquisite composition, in ragas
Todi  and
Khamaj , brings out the best of Lata. Right from her
alaap , she hooks you and forces you to come back to the song again and again.
 Ehsaan tera hoga...(Junglee)   
  Many of Lata‘s most popular melodies may have been composed by the likes of Madan Mohan, S.D. Burman and Naushad, but the hugely talented duo of Shankar-Jaikishen also has also given her several gems, such as this one for the 1961 film Junglee. It is one of those songs that are rendered separately by Lata and Mohammed Rafi. Such double delights include
Mere mehboob tujhe... (Mere Mehboob) ,
Mein kamsin hoon... (Aayee Milan Ki Bela) ,
Teri aankhon ke sivaa... (Chirag) ,
Tum mujhe yun... (Pagla Kahin Ka) and
Ajee rooth kar kahaan... (Arzoo). Ae mere watan ke logon...  For a country where music mostly means film music,
this patriotic song moved a nation like no film song could. Recorded as a tribute to the Indian soldiers who fought against China in the 1962 war, it was written by poet Pradeep and tuned by C. Ramachandra.
 It was no rousing song, but a poignant one – penned so evocatively by Pradeep – that spoke about the sacrifices of the soldier. Lata‘s performance, at the National Stadium in New Delhi on the Republic Day in 1963, in the presence of President S. Radhakrishnan and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, had the audience in tears.  There are, of courses, hundreds of songs by Lata that we never will get tire of, such as
Yeh zindagi usi ki hai...(Anarkali) ,
Woh chup rahe to...(Jahan Ara) ,
Nainon mein badra...(Mera Saya) ,
Hawa mein udta...(Barsaat) ,
Nagma oh sher ki... (Ghazal) ,
Suno sajnaa...(Aaye Din Bahaar Ke) ,
Rasik balmaa...(Chori Chori) , A
 aaj phir jeene ki...(Guide) ,
Baahon mein chale aao...(Anamika) ,
Aaap ki nazron ne samjhaa...(Anapdh) ,
Bahaaron mera...(Aakhri Khat) ,
Ye dil aur unki...(Prem Parbat) ,
Ruk jaa raat... (Dil Ek Mandir) ,
Bindiyaa chamkegi... (Do Raaste) ,
Allah tero naam... (Hum Dono) ,
Mora gora ang... (Bandini) ,
Tum na jaane is jagah... (Sazaa) ,
Megha chhaye aadhi raat... (Sharmeelee) ,
(Naina barse... (Who Kaun Thi) ,
Piya tose naina... (Guide) ,
Ajeeb daastaan hai... (Dil Apna Aur Preet Parai) ,
Hum ne dekhi hai.. (Khamoshi) ,

1060,"February 06, 2022",12:56 IST,entertainment,music,"Lata Mangeshkar — her voice worked for any one, any situation and any era","  We prayed for
 her immortality . Her voice registered our strengths and frailties. She soothed us when everything was lost, her aural sensuality was present in our first kiss, and her pleading for unity cut through a sharply divided society. Each one of us created an unbreakable personal bond with her. 　
 We often associate playback singers with specific actors. The singer becomes the musical expression — an extension — of the actor. This is so well established that when an actor completes a dialogue and the scene segues into a song, we do not notice a difference; the voices merge. 　 Lata Mangeshkar’s voice did not belong to any one actor; she was every actor’s voice. It would be appropriate to say her voice was theirs! She did not hide her presence behind the actors; you always knew it was her. The actor became Lata’s expressive moving picture. Yet, her personality never mediated our relationship with the story. It was as if her voice worked for any one, any situation and any era. Hence, there was no need for that illusionary trick. This seems contradictory, even impossible, but it did happen. 　
 We speak of playback singers being influenced by the voice, mannerisms and accent of actors they represented. In Lata’s case, I would argue that every actor’s acting improved when they heard her track being played for a song they were filming. How could it not? Watch any scene of a song she rendered and it is as if she coaxed the actors to come up to her standards of emotivity. 　 Emotion in music is spoken of in esoteric terms, or as something that happens through experience and maturity. Otherwise, we are told, internalise the meaning, understand the context, the melody and involve yourself in the singing and emotionality will be transferred into the song. We may feel the song in our bones but our rendition can still lack the needed emotive layering. Emotional communication in music is a technique. It exists in the way we use our voice; we enunciate each syllable and our treatment of the melodic and rhythmic cadences in the song. With Lata, every second oozed emotion; it was in the way she sang. The minor shifts in tonality, the timbral and decibel control over a musical phrase and the way the words were enunciated. 　 Also ReadLata Mangeshkar rendered a few all-time greats in Tamil films
 
 Reading a line of poetry has little to do with singing it. When I say ‘mohabbat’, I am speaking of love; when I sing, it is the essence of love. That inner resonance appears because the word is not tightly bound by its own construction. It spreads its wings inviting us to romance its every consonant and vowel. Lata gave musical life to every syllable she sang. The meaning of the word was felt even before the word was completed. And then there was the last note! That tantalising drop at the end of a musical turn, curve, statement or question. The line was over but Lata’s voice remained for just that extra micro-second, gifting that last notea memory. The next line began from its silent listening. I can still hear that dissolving note, it was magic.　 Speed is often overglorified. Singers deliberately direct our attention towards it, and the felicity of their voice. But the brilliance of speed is when the rush, the adrenaline, is not known. Lata sang supersonic phrases without bravado. When you watched the song sequence, you did not even know that she had executed something demanding. It seemed as easy as the actor’s mime. The sheer control behind these renditions should not be categorised just as technical proviso. The complexity of the melody never came in the way of her emotive power. In the case of other singers, emotion would wane and wax within one song. There would be moments when their hearts were present in the music, and times when they were only aiming for musical accuracy. That was never the case with Lata. She did not make her vocal virtuosity obvious. She just made us smile, cry, love and celebrate, unaware of the musical brilliance. 　 Also ReadThe best of Lata Mangeshkar 
 
 Through the decades, Lata’s voice aged and all of us recognised that. But the voice never became old! Another paradox. There are voices that do not age; there are those that become old. But to age yet remain young is rare. The ageing was physical, her vocal cords did tire, there was a perceptible tremble in the voice, but she did not sound old. Her musical expression was young. By young, I am not referring to youthfulness, but rather the quality of being alive. This spirit gave her voice bloom. 　 Lata had her detractors. Some complained that her voice was too shrill; just as they said of M.S. Subbulakshmi, the nightingale from the South. Lata is not versatile enough, they complained. But all this did not matter because, she was the song. If there was one criticism that took the sheen off the Lata enigma, it was that she suppressed other talents from emerging during her reign. I am certain there are many truths to this and no single one will give us the whole picture. 　 I think of Lata and a mystical land comes to my mind. She exists in my dream sequence and her voice emanates from an unseen person. I search for her knowing fully well we will never meet. She flits in and then vanishes. And I wait patiently for the next time. But unlike that dreamland voice, Lata was always present. As far as I am concerned, she has not moved on; she remains with us, our celestial voice. 　 T.M.

1061,"February 06, 2022",12:13 IST,entertainment,music,Lata Mangeshkar 1929-2022,"  Singing legend
Lata Mangeshkar , the voice of generations of Indians and one of the biggest music icons of the country, died on February 6 due to multiple organ failure.
  The
‘Nightingale of India’ had a career spanning eight decades and has sung innumerable songs in 36 languages.
 The story of Lata Mangeshkar, like that of Carnatic doyenne M.S. Subbulakshmi, is at once the story of personal victories and also of how women changed the course of performing history. ",author not available,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/lata-mangeshkar-dies/article65045014.ece
1062,"February 06, 2022",10:49 IST,entertainment,music,Lata Mangeshkar: A voice for every emotion,"  While rehearsing, composers waited for her half-smile for it meant Lata had found a particular phrase challenging. Lyricists longed for the unsaid that she would add to their mortal words to make them timeless. Ordinary words like mulayam (soft), pani (water) acquired a deeper connotation when she rendered them in
Yeh Kahan Aa Gaye Hum (Silsila) and
Paani Paani Re (Maachis) Even the colloquial phrases like
hoon hoon started throbbing with life in Lata’s voice as she wailed in
Rudali.   Be it the Arabic influence in Sajjad Hussein’s music or the classical approach of Naushad, she adapted to the demands of the illustrious composers across generations. Her voice suited the style of melody makers like C. Ramachandra, Roshan and Ravi. Salil Chowdhury consistently pushed her out of her comfort zone and so did R.D. Burman. Lata was up to it as she retained her sweetness even in higher octaves and was not insecure about singing songs in lower notes. With Madan Mohan and Khayyam, she excelled in ghazals, while with Shankar Jaikishan, Kalyanji Anandji and Laxmikant Pyarelal she explored the mass appeal of the Hindi film song. For A.R. Rahman, Lata travelled to Chennai and broke into an impromptu magical
alap when she recorded
Jiya Jale (
Dil Se ). For recording “Luka Chhuppi (
Rang De Basanti), she stood for eight hours.

 Her voice pierced through the microphone and registered perfectly at the recording instrument. Recording technicians had to work the least on her voice. Her training and sensitive understanding of the intricacies of the mood of the song made her indispensable. Lag Ja Gale (
Woh Kaun Thi ) sounds as ethereal as it is seductive.
O Sajna Barkha Bahar Aayi (Parakh) is an example of her sheer control over high and lower octaves and in
Aaj Phir Jeene Ki TamannaHai (Guide) she captures the exuberance of a girl who has just broken some social shackles. In songs like
O Beqrar Dil,  and
Ajeeb Dastan Hai Ye,  she beautifully captured the melancholic shades of love. Who can forget the bhajan
Allah Tero Naam  with Jaidev or
Ae Mere Watan Ke Logon  that brought tears into the eyes of Pandit Nehru.

1063,"February 06, 2022",10:35 IST,entertainment,music,Lata Mangeshkar (1929-2022): The singer who consistently struck that divine 'sur',"  The nation of more than a billion lost its most popular voice, as
Lata Mangeshkar (1929-2022) transcended to the heavenly stage on Sunday. More than just a name, over the years, the Bharat Ratna became an adjective, an emotion that got so deeply ingrained in the Indian consciousness that her voice became the benchmark of excellence and purity. Usually, film personalities have fans, Lata has devotees for if the melody is the link that connects man to almighty, Lata consistently struck that divine
sur.  Ephemeral phrases like singing sensation were not for her. She was always the voice of virtue. No wonder, her voice inspired Raj Kapoor to mount
Satyam Shivam Sundaram . Or the way Gulzar simply put for her in the
Kinara song ,
Meri Awaaz Hi Meri Pehchan Hai (m y voice is my identity).

The discs featured the name of the character rather than the playback singer. She along with Mohd Rafi gave shape to the culture of playback singing in Hindi cinema. Like Noor Jehan and Suraiya, Lata was also offered acting parts but she wanted only her voice to be heard. And she did become the prima donna of playback singing in no time. From Madhubala to Kajol and Preity Zinta, female actors were considered to have arrived on the scene when they got an opportunity to lip-sync to Lata’s voice.

 Post-independence, when Dilip Kumar emerged as the Nehruvian hero, Lata’s voice echoed the soul of India that was exuberant and plaintive at the same time. From the first flush of youth to the twinge of separation, there is no mood, no shade of human psyche that Lata didn’t give voice to and along the way made a legion of followers believe that perfection is not unattainable in creative arts. Born in a conservative musical Marathi household, her training started early when she eavesdropped on her father Dinanath Mangeshkar’s training sessions. A stern taskmaster, one day the noted classical singer and theatre veteran discovered a young Lata correcting one of his students, telling him how her father renders a particular raga, in his absence. He promptly took her under his wings and a 5-6-year-old Lata would sing alongside her father and sleep on his lap. But for the fate that reduced her to the sole breadwinner in the family of five siblings at a very young age, Lata would have shone on the firmament of classical music. It was something that she regretted all her life. It also meant that singing became her life. She would starve through the day so that she could save every single penny for the family. The early struggle ingrained in her a sense of discipline and a guarded approach towards the world.  In the recording studio, none could match the purity and clarity of her voice and the control over the pitch. After listening to
Ye Zindagi Usi Ki Hai , the poignant number from
Anarkali in raga Bhimplasi , Bade Ghulam Ali Khan remarked
Kambakth Kabhi Besuri Nahin Hoti (The wretched girl never goes out of tune). It was 1953 and the best of Lata was yet to come.
 Her mentor Ghulam Haider instilled in a young Lata the importance of feeling the joys and pain of the character. Anil Biswas taught her the value of breath control and Naushad and Salil Chowdhury tested how high she could go with notes. Her sweet voice quickly displaced the robust nasal voices like Shamshad Begum and Geeta Dutt.  Outside the studio, in white saris and side parting hairstyle, she carefully crafted an image where even the film media, which thrives on gossip, presented her as a sisterly figure who loved to tie
rakhis on the industry’s big wigs.
  However, beneath that benign half-smile and muted silks, the resilient Lata was all steel. When producer Shashadhar Mukherjee termed her voice too thin, she worked on her timbre. When Dilip Kumar offhandedly remarked that her voice smelt of
dal bhaat,  she made sure that she got the nuances of Urdu right.
Beqas Pe Karam, t he naat in
Mughal-e-Azam  is a testimony to her command over the language, and Khayyam’s serene
Ae Dil e Nadan (Razia Sultan) remained her favourite song.
 She didn’t budge an inch over royalty rights even if it meant a cold war with Mohd Rafi. At the peak of her career, when S.D. Burman made an uncharitable remark, she didn’t work with the master composer for five years. She refused to perform in film award functions until a separate category was created for playback singers in 1959. From 1959 to 1970, she won four Filmfare Awards. Out of these three came when there was no separate category for female playback singers. In 1971, in an unusual gesture, she asked the jury not to consider her to promote fresh talent. Lata emerged unscathed from all the battles as none of it could stop her from becoming a phenomenon and staying on top for over six decades. When she was at the top of her game, her word was enough for a composer to a get prized project. No wonder, she was disparagingly called Maharani or High Command by those who bit the dust in the games of one-upmanship that are discreetly played in the highly competitive industry. Film magazines dubbed it as ‘Mangeshkar Monopoly’ but the march of the diminutive Lata could not be checked.  Her longevity is awe-inspiring. Having started at 13, it was natural that for a long time Lata retained the girlish flavour in her voice. The haunting
Aayega Aane Wala (
Mahal, 1948 ) that she sang at the age of 20 continues to be a balm for heartache. Surprisingly, her voice didn’t age and she retained the vocal agility and ability to negotiate complex passages of compositions well. The Lata of
Parichay that won her first National Award for
Beeti Na Bitai Raina in 1972  was very different from the Lata that sang
 Aaja Re Pardesi  in
 Madhumati in 1958.  Lata was 66 when she made the youth swoon to
Mere Khwabon Main Jo Aaye (
Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge , 1995). Just a few years back she had won her third National Award for
Yaara Sili Sili (Lekin 1991) , a composition of her brother Hridaynath Mangeshkar that is steeped in classical notes.
 The woman who sang in Lata’s voice was invariably a ‘good’ woman. In hindsight, some observers see it as Lata’s limitation but actually, it is a reflection of the kind of protagonists that populated popular cinema in the 1950s and 60s and the style that the composers asked her to adopt. She was invariably called to justify the most intricate compositions.  It is not that Lata was not capable of rendering the flamboyant songs that O.P. Nayyar, the only major name that she didn’t sing for, created for her younger sister Asha but she looked for some substance even in the so-called light stuff. Whenever the heroine ventured into forbidden spaces, Lata also expanded her horizon. From
Chadh Gayo Papi Bichhua (Madhumati),
Thade Rahiyo (Pakeezah),
Mann Kyun Behka (Utsav) to
Jiya Jale (Dil Se), there are multiple examples where Lata has given voice to the sensory pleasures of a woman and was absolutely naughty in
Kanta Laga . It is another matter that in her voice even a cabaret would sound divine as we experienced in
Aa Jaane Ja (Inteqam). The sound of Kolhapuri chapppals announced her arrival in the recording studios but the golden anklets and fondness for diamonds reflected a royal taste. Quietly ambitious, she bought her first car, a Hillman, when she was just 18. She had a keen interest in cricket and photography and her voice was heard in the higher echelons of government, irrespective of the party in power. When remixes became a rage and reality shows a mundane reality, she voiced her concern for the diminishing originality in popular music and the culture of instant gratification.  Till the end, she assiduously guarded her private space and made the world feel that it was a
Kora Kagaaz but her melodious voice will continue to reside in all of us.

Photographer-actor Luv, displaying two of his photographs, says, “My photographs are bold and loud–they are about energy, colours, and positivity. Every photographer has a vision, and, for me, framing eye-catching objects is appealing.” Kussh Sinha affirms, “Art is a way of giving creativity a physical form.

It was a typical Chennai motta maadi, with a view of similar terraces with peeling walls, clothes lines and potted plants as far as the eye could see. He then had an idea: why not turn this warm, comforting space into an art gallery? He did just that for his latest show titled Mottamaadi.  Koilpitchai studied at the Government College of Fine Arts, Egmore and has been showing his work from 2009 at various galleries in the city apart from places such as Delhi, Nagpur, and Coimbatore. “But the gallery remains a space that excludes everyday people,” feels the 39-year-old, speaking over phone from Chennai. “When I was a student and entered an art gallery for the first time, I remember being intimidated by it,” he says.  Today, nearly two decades later, he can still remember the feeling. “I have seen several upcoming artists disappear for lack of an opportunity to show at a gallery,” he says. Which is why he decided to host a show in his terrace as an experiment. “This is the second show on my terrace and I honestly do not know how it will turn out,” he feels. “But it is an attempt to show fellow artists that they too can do this. They can use their space for a show; or even a park for instance, with permission from the Corporation.” Koilpitchai is from Tirunelveli and most of his work — he does acrylic on canvas apart from ceramic sculptures — reflect his landscape. “I document the changing phases of my hometown,” he says. For instance, the ‘thinnai’ culture, in which people spend long hours sitting on a friend’s verandah, talking or simply listening. “This is becoming a thing of the past since a lot of people are migrating to bigger cities,” points out Koilpitchai. “This may be for better work opportunities, or to escape oppression from the hands of dominant people in their village.” He paints these ghost towns and their crumbling tile-roofed houses; the wells that are a farmer’s lifeline; just-tilled land with saplings facing the sky; whitewashed houses with vintage grilled gates. “My work is photorealistic,” says Koilpitchai. “What sets it apart from an actual image of the landscape is that in the painting, every thorn, every texture on a wall, every leaf has a bit of me.”  Mottamaadi is on till April 10, 6pm to 9pm at No 35, E-2, Subramaniam Road, Perambur.

Poornima elaborates, “In the first phase, our priority is to focus on art collectors because when they connect with the works, it will indirectly help the artists. We also hope to reach out to museums and libraries.”  The mammoth task of shortlisting 100 practising artists proved tough. Poornima and her team of seven at Art Houz reached out to Lalit Kala Akademi in Delhi for a list of practising artists and galleries across India and also used their decade-long experience in the art field to shortlist artists at various stages of their careers.  The show, an offshoot of the book, is a travelling one that has come to Hyderabad after its launch in Chennai. While the book has one work of each artist, the exhibition features more works in their respective cities. “There is a bit of everyone in the book, whether they are printmakers or artists.

We are conditioned to believe we can be only this or that. I would not be happy that way,” says Priyanka, speaking with The Hindu at the Alliance Francaise of Hyderabad. Although the aerospace engineer (Ph.D) has studied several rocket launches, she never felt as ‘emotionally invested’ as the Cygnus spacecraft, launched on an NG Antares rocket (NG-17 NASA Commercial Resupply Mission) took a bit of art into space in February this year.  Organised by Moon Gallery Foundation (curators Anna Sitnikova Elizaveta Glukhova) , the Moon Gallery Project is a prototype test payload with 65 tiny artworks (10x10x1 centimetre) by artists from across the globe that took off to space in February this year. The project will be onboard the International Space station for another 10 months and is a precursor to sending a similar gallery to the moon in a couple of years.  “The key point of the project is to send a small gallery to the Moon to remind people not to forget the cultural aspects of their existence; It was a technological challenge for artists to fit their work into something so tiny as a 1-centimetre cube,” she says. Her artwork ‘Bhédadīpikā - An Illustration of Duality’ includes two objects: a strip of paper with hand-drawn phases of the moon coated with phosphorescent ink, with the word ‘Moon’ written in Indian and European languages (that are important to preserve) and a 4 GB nanochip comprising artistic simulations coded using the software.  ‘Bhédadīpikā’ illustrates duality and is inspired by the ‘conflict’ of her wanting to pursue both art and science since childhood. At school, she was this ‘odd kid’ excelling in science and math and also winning competitions in art. Recalling growing up in Delhi, Priyanka, who is a French national with roots in Assam, credits her parents Manoj Kumar Das and Dr Ajanta Baruah Das for nurturing the love of learning in her. Artistic expression also helped when she would rebel against being called names due to her race or when her protective but otherwise liberal parents did not allow her to go out at night with friends. She joined the National Institute of Design in 2010 but left mid-way to pursue graduation in physics from St. Stephens in Delhi. Then she moved to France to study Artificial Intelligence and Aerospace Engineering at École Polytechnique. “There I made friends and got a lot of opportunities to explore my interest in space and slowly transitioned from ‘oh I’m like those kids who dream of being an astronaut’ to ‘oh I could actually become one.” Life took a different turn when she had a near-death experience at 25. With parents by her side and friends instrumental in recovering, she started on her PhD. She recollects, “I began appreciating my parents and friends more and also grew as a person. I started living for the day.” This was also the phase where she was ‘less dedicated to just pure sciences’ and more inclined towards art. Three years ago, she met a group of artists working on sending artworks to space for the Moon Project and her idea got selected. “As an artist, it’s our duty to tell people to step away from the technical and financial aspects and think of the global theme of humanity as cultural beings. One cannot think that astronauts are robots just doing experiments in space; Plus, you go crazy if you’re doing just mechanical work in that cramped space. They’re human beings; they are going to miss their family in space; they need recreation and music too. This artistic expression is so important for us as humans.” Moon Gallery Project is also an occasion to scientifically study what happens to materials sent in space and how radiation, zero gravity, additional velocity and acceleration affect the artworks . “It was also like a research project for the artists to see how the artwork reacts in the space and also some of us might have to redesign based on the research.”  Her next step as an artist is to collaborate more with people from the arts for ‘a holistic space explorative path.’ “The younger generation also is getting bogged down by pressures of going in just one direction. The interdisciplinary way of science is the way forward. Otherwise, we will not have sustainable projects.”",Neeraja Murthy,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/aerospace-engineer-artist-priyanka-das-rajkakatis-heart-beats-for-art-and-science/article65273500.ece
1072,"March 30, 2022",14:39 IST,entertainment,art,Pichwai paintings: Yugdeepak Soni’s brush with the divine," In the late 16th Century, the borderlands of Mewar was wild country inhabited by warring tribes and weary travellers on the old caravan routes that snaked around the Thar desert. But its heart, a few hundred miles to the South, was peppered with lakes, and the colour-drained landscape where only windblown acacia survived gave way to verdant valleys, forests and ancient wells where bulls drew water. Here, in what is now Rajsamand district, was raised the Shrinathji temple at Nathdwara, pilgrim centre for Vaishnavites and birthplace of the Pichwai tradition of painting. The paintings, predominantly of Krishna with large eyes and a stocky build, earned their name because they were hung behind the deity ( peech-behind,  vai-hang). In the four centuries since, Pichwai has come to encompass various themes – the Ras Lila, Jain folklore, the pantheon of Hindu gods, the  Hanuman Chalisa, scenes from courtly life, and local flora and fauna – although it is Shrinathji as the cowherd, holding up Mount Govardhan, and appearing to his devotees that still holds forte. At a workshop as part of Indradhanush, an exhibition of Pichwai paintings, artist Yugdeepak Soni traverses the cultural distance of this art form, as he draws the outline of a woman on a sheet of handmade paper after rubbing it down with onyx. The figure is characteristic of the Mewar school, drawn in profile with almond-shaped eyes and a sharp nose. Soni fills the colours of her skirt and bodice, line by line, using a fine-tipped brush, with the practised ease of a painter who has spent years mastering the form. “My introduction to Pichwai came after I dropped out of school. I was packed off to Bhilwara for a couple of years, to the house of my maternal uncle who had learnt from my great grandfather, the renowned Badri Lal Chitrakar. I felt at home with the brush, learning from the best on how to make pigments, the technique, how to play with colours, find inspiration and, most importantly, to feel joy while pursuing it. If there is joy inside you, the colours will find you,” says Soni, who now lives in Udaipur. “I’ve been painting for two decades, but I’m still learning. Mistakes happen in the concept and the scale of the work since a single work takes months. Reading folklore, mythology and observing cultural events help anchor the art, though some of the inspiration on how to apply the style comes from previous works.” Primarily painted on cotton cloth, muslin or handmade paper, over time, Pichwai moved from temples to opulent drawing rooms and from the  raag-bhog-shringar (music, food and jewellery for the deity) format to homespun vignettes of rural Rajasthan. The exhibition showcases 55 of Soni’s works, some painted over the course of the pandemic, with an array of brushes and colour. “For the eye and brow, the single-hair squirrel tail brush is used, while the brush made of mongoose hair is used for thicker lines,” says Soni, adding that he uses indigo, metallic and mineral paints, and gold foil, especially while executing the Mughal and Rajput styles.       The paintings are in varied sizes, the cloth panels being larger, and the ones on paper more crowded with elements. Banana trees hold their own in a sea of other trees, peacocks cavort as grey-blue-white monsoon clouds scud across an indigo sky in curls, cows trot through the landscape and also line the well-defined borders as women dance with dream-like intensity. The hanging display allows the viewer to engage with the painting and gaze at the detail of the artist’s firm hand. Colours that are ripe and rounded fill them, restrained only by geometric precision. Fillers, like  chattris, boats, lotuses and orchards are scattered in odd spaces keeping to the theme. Soni says he prefers to work during the day as colours show up best in sunlight. Among the canvases that stand out are Krishna Leela, filled with row upon row of dancers in gay abandon with Krishna holding centre-stage and Gopastami that has cows with uplifted chins gazing at Shrinathji. A towering cosmic Vishnu in a midnight-blue filled with mythical scenes, Soni’s favourite (Utsava) that has women sitting plump on lotuses and cows on leaf pads around Shrinathji; elephants wrestling with their trunks locked in embrace, the gold on their clanking chains glinting into the gallery light; and the festival of Gangaur, women looking out of lattice-screen windows as a parade of boats filled with men in hot pink turbans sails past the ghat paying obeisance to the maharana, are some that stand out.  Each of these frames is ethereal encompassing a world that shifts between the spiritual and the cultural, much like Mewar’s myriad landscape.   The exhibition is open Monday to Saturday, 10.30am to 6.30pm at Forum Art Gallery, 57, 5th Street Padmanabha Nagar, Adyar, till April 8.

1073,"March 29, 2022",14:20 IST,entertainment,art,Anita Lal is India’s first tastemaker for Christie’s," It comes as no surprise that Anita Lal, 73, fondly known by her initials, AL, is Christie’s tastemaker for a Spring sale this week. After all, the founder of Good Earth, the home goods and apparel company that celebrated its 25th anniversary last year, has led many craft interventions. The brand was behind interior restorations like the Rajmahal Palace in Jaipur, a partnership with the Victoria and Albert Museum (Fabric of India exhibition) and, more recently, the Heirloom Project, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. It marked a decade of the museum’s Islamic wing. This month, as tastemaker for Art of the Islamic and Indian Worlds Including Oriental Rugs and Carpets, Lal created an edit of personal favourites from the sale and has curated digital vignettes with Good Earth products, objects she has “cherished over the years”. While this is the first time Christie’s has worked with a tastemaker based in India, past tastemakers include Aerin Lauder (of luxury US brand Aerin) and British interior designers Rita Konig and Kit Kemp. Meanwhile, at the headquarters of Christie’s in central London, three-room vignettes have been recreated using personally-chosen pieces from Good Earth by Lal. They will be showcased alongside the approximately 211 lots dating from the 9th to the 19th century. More from the founder and creative director of Good Earth: 
“Islamic culture is deeply integrated within the Indian subcontinent, and it shows in the way we dress, our music, our food, our language and in our decorative patterns. It is so integral in our lives we hardly even notice that”Anita LalFounder, Good Earth As a design house out of India, we celebrate every cultural aspect of the subcontinent [including Vedic, Buddhist, Persian and Mughal influences, and from lands across the Silk Road]. Islamic culture is deeply integrated within the Indian subcontinent, and it shows in the way we dress, our music, our food, our language, and in our decorative patterns. Over the years we have created numerous design collections based on some aspect of Islamic design, including vintage shawls. One of my favourites was Farah Baksh, a Persian/Urdu term which translates as ‘Bestower of Delight’ inspired by the Persian paradise gardens Charbagh that were created in Kashmir by the Mughals. If I had to pick one item from the sale, it would be the Tabriz carpet. Van Vaibhav means ‘splendour of the forest’ and is a leitmotif at Good Earth. Blossoming trees with birds and animals is a recurring theme in our designs interpreted so exquisitely in this carpet. I treasure things from the smallest handmade ceramic vase to a grand sculpture or an antique chair and I mix them all together. My home is a relaxed mix of everything that I love and that includes some priceless inherited antiques and Agra jail carpets along with studio pottery that I have been collecting and a lot of Indian art that my husband has bought over the years. Our furniture is also a mix of modern pieces that sit alongside vintage furniture from the family’s ancestral home in Hisar. Bim Bissel [wife of Fabindia’s founder, the late John Bissell] is the first person who comes to mind as a tastemaker. Her stylish home reflects her warm personality and she entertains in an easy, informal style, mixing interesting people of all age groups with diverse interests. The Bissel Christmas brunch is legendary. Open for viewing till March 30. Auction on King Street, London, on March 31.

1074,"March 26, 2022",15:30 IST,entertainment,art,Glitter attains divinity at Yadadri," A sculptural and spiritual treat awaits the devotees at Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy temple at Yadadri set to reopen on March 28 after a massive renovation. The icing on the cake is the installation of the intricately-designed 52 golden kalasams atop the gopurams.  Designed and gold plated by the Chennai-based Smart Creations, the kalasams are made with the Nano Tech Gold Deposition (NTGD) technology, which allows lesser consumption of gold. It increases the affordability of the projects by reducing the use to about 5 grams per sqft.  ""Unlike the conventional gold coating, the thickness of the gold layer using this method is reduced to microns. This is achieved through electroplating of gold onto a suitable metal substrate, preferably copper, which is well known for its conductivity. The initial copper electroplating ensures a smooth and even finish. The same can be replicated with silver electroplating as well. The longevity of the product is also assured as the gold is plated rather than applied as a coating. The final product is significantly lighter and easier to handle than products coated through conventional methods. The best part is the gold deposited through this method is 100% recoverable at any given point of time."" says Mr Pankkaj Bhaandari, founder, Smart Creations, who has been into restoration and beautification of temples across the country and abroad. The cutting edge nanotechnology that has gone into the making of the golden kalasams is also used in NASA/ISRO defence applications and equipment. Says Mr Bhaandari, ""We use the same technology but customised for spiritual spaces for validation and longevity. Additionally, our gold coating is protected from surface damage by a hard lacquer coating. Our artefacts can, therefore, be passed down to generations looking as good as brand new.""  In a gold-plating work, normally the gold loses its shine after 15 years. The government of Telangana was keen on a 50-year warranty of the gold plating. Smart Creations studied and took ideas from temples across India — Dharmshala, Kashi Vishwanath temple, Siddhi Vinayak Temple in Mumbai, Amritsar Golden Temple and Sabarimala temple. ""We considered the environmental and religious factors before figuring out what works for the temple,"" states Mr Bhaandari, an ISB-Stanford Alumni, who also studied a masjid in Central London built by the Iranian community. ""I managed to get photographs of it a few decades ago and now to study how the lustre of the gold has changed. I sat with chemical scientists to figure out how we need to eliminate the copper-gold migration technique and how gold needs to be fused between two layers to achieve the 50-year-warranty of gold mandate."" Smart Creations had engaged the services of architect Ravindran Sthapathi, who is a 35th generation artisan, to design the kalasams. Ravindran ensured that Agama Sastra rules were conformed to while designing. ""The 52 kalasams are hand beaten on copper shields as per the spiritual measurements and then were gold-plated at our factory and delivered back to the temple,"" says Mr Bhaandari. Stating that it is a special project for his company, Mr Bhaandari admits that they have never been involved in this kind of temple renovation. ""We have been picked over a process that has been scientific makes it special for us and the way the Telangana government has gone about preparing the document about what should be the selection process is amazing."" Smart Creations has done work in over 100 temples in India, worked on over 10,000 idols, restored over one lakh idols including gold-plating of a dwajasthambam at Virudhnagar church in Chennai and over 60 dwajasthambams at Shri Jirawala Parshwanath Jain Tirth temple in Rajasthan using the NTGD technology.  Smart Creation diversified in 2014, to expand the NTDG technology from temples to puja rooms — prayer spaces within homes. ""A whole lot of prayer spaces got designed and executed by us using NDTG technology for the vigrahas, kuthuvilakku, and other decorative accessories.""",S B Vijaya Mary,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/fifty-two-golden-kalasams-designed-with-ntgd-technology-to-be-the-crowning-glory-of-yadadri/article65259165.ece

1076,"March 26, 2022",10:36 IST,entertainment,art,A documentary and a docu-fiction focus on aspects of Kathakali," Each Kathakali play transports viewers to an enchanted land of larger-than-life heroes and heroines, beasts and saints. Two documentaries released on YouTube recently attempt to understand what has helped this form of theatre cast a spell on modern-day practitioners and viewers.  Directed by Kathakali aficiando Vinu Vasudevan, the 10-minute short film goes behind the scene to find out what attracts a child to Kerala’s theatre art form, which includes vocal music, percussion, dance and acts.  One of the members of Malappuram-based People Story Collective, of which Vinu is also a member, had approached Vinu during Onam last year to do a documentary on different kinds of story-telling.  Says Vinu: “I had written ‘Paccha Mokaru’ (Green Face), a short story, many years ago. It was the green facial make-up of Kathakali heroes that enthralled me as a child. I used that as the script to make the film.”  Vinu explains that in many ways, the story is autobiographical. Kathakali performances were held regularly at his spacious house in Malappuram district. “Initially, what fascinated me was the colourful costumes and makeup of the artistes.” That attraction evolved into a deep interest in Kathakali. At the age of 10, Vinu began learning Kathakali and performed for a few years before becoming a discerning viewer and organiser of Kathakali.  It is that early journey from curious child to performer that the 10-minute short narrates in Petti Paranja Katha. The title refers to the voluminous box, called an atta petti, in which Kathakali performers used to keep their costumes. Sketches in black and white enhance the narrative that tells viewers how performers used to carry the boxes on their heads or in bullock carts when they had to travel for recitals.  Narippatta Narayanan Namboodiri’s grandson, Devan Cherumittam, plays the young boy watching wide eyed as the actors get ready for a recital.  But for a few shots, the entire film, shot in Vellinezhi and Karalmanna, was done against the background of a real-life performances. The sound of the melam enhances the visuals.  The film was released on the People Story Collective’s YouTube channel on March 19. At the age of 25, Haripriya Namboodiri, a teacher, fell in love with Kathakali. Exposed to the art since childhood at her mother’s home in Manjeri, she decided to learn Kathakali from a guru to become a knowledgable spectator. Her training was under thespian Kalamandalam Vasu Pisharody.  “I had no idea of ever performing on stage. Within a year, however, I was on stage enacting the character of Sati in Dakshayagam Kathakali.  The film , Haripriya, follows petite Haripriya’s evolution as she steps into a male bastion with elan. Traditionally, men used to perform all the women characters in Kathakali. The artiste talks about how she, a professional, homemaker and mother, honed her interest and became a performer on stages all over India. Over the years Haripriya had breathed life into Kathakali characters such as Lalitha, Damayanthi and Urvashi. “The short film focusses on me because I chose to become a Kathakali performer though I had other career options. Although it took time and hours of hard work, I was able to find my feet in a traditional male-dominated art form,” she says.  In the film, Haripriya elaborates why she prefers to essay women characters. In between learning and performing, she also did her doctoral research on the feminine in Kathakali from Kalamandalam Deemed University. That academic background has helped her understand and find her space in interpreting female characters in Kathakali.  Vasu Pisharody explains why he would like to see more women donning female roles in Kathakali.  Directed by Shruthi Sharanyam, the 22-minute documentary also delves into the space for women on the Kathakali stage. “Sarvamagala Productions which is documenting the cultural landscapes and art forms of Kerala, approached me to do a documentary on Haripriya. I have worked with her in my music video and so we have a good rapport. The documentary has been given a cinematic treatment,” explains Shruthi. Music has been scored by Sudeep Palanad  Haripriya was released on YouTube on March 8.

1077,"March 24, 2022",15:18 IST,entertainment,art,‘Lonely Planet’ exhibition in Hyderabad conveys a stark message,"  “Did you ever wonder how desolate our planet Earth is becoming by losing its green cover?” ask Hyderabad-based artists in their ongoing art show, ‘Lonely Planet’, at the State Art Gallery. The 68 works by 11 artists comprise paintings, sculptures, photographs, installations and video art - conveying a stark message on the effects of urbanisation on cities/villages and the environmental pollutants’ impact on the biodiversity and ecological processes.  Focus on environment Harsha Kancharla’s 28 feet (diameter) X 16 feet (height) installation like a chandelier hanging from the ceiling at the entrance, presents the perceptions of the young . The exhibit features 2,000 cotton masks connected with red wool threads, with students’ opinions written on them as text, drawings, poems and paper clippings. “This is an attempt to know the viewpoints of future generations,” says Sriharsha, pursuing her Masters from the University of Hyderabad. Students of Class VI to X from 11 schools including Kanya Gurukul school, Sister Nivedita, Triveni School, Hyderabad Public School, Slate The School and Unison International School participated in this exercise. Sayam Bharath Yadav’s work ‘ Jeena yahan marna yahan, Iske sivaay jaana kahaan’ focuses on the animal world. “We are getting disconnected from Nature. Rural areas getting urbanized is leading to deforestation.” He adds, “We use helmets to protect our head, why not them,” pointing towards an animal sporting a helmet on the canvas. Also curating the show, Bharath shares, “I have been living with this idea for eight months now. The other artists were more than enthusiastic to join me on this journey.” His installation - geometrical iron blocks in glossy Duco paints of gold and black on a wooden cart placed on a tree stump highlights the ‘development’ seeping into rural areas.  Jaya Prakash Doma’s video art depicts the impact of depleting open fields on livestock. “Cows and buffaloes used to feed on the grass in open lands or fields. Now with these spaces diminishing, these animals feed on garbage; the results can be seen in the hazardous milk we consume,” he says.  Sabita Lakshmanan’s poem, narrating the story of a peepal tree, leads to her exhibit — a papier-mache lung-shaped sculpture placed on a tree trunk, with dried leaves strewn on it and a bunch of roses placed in front. This work is close to Sabitha Lakshmanan’s heart. “I could save only the tree trunk left on the road and used it for the installation,” recalls the artist who collected 17 bags of dried leaves from KBR Park for the exhibit. “We are not seeing the huge loss that we are creating by cutting a tree. If we don’t provide a future for plants, there is no future for humanity either.” Lotuses, weaving, tools and human forms create multiple expressions in Mahesh Pottabathini’s works. The artist celebrates Nature in his painting titled ‘Transforming Nature’. Hailing from a weaver’s community, Mahesh often integrates weaving techniques on canvas. A set of blooming lotuses bound by a weaving thread has a girl’s image in the background. He also compares how the lotus motif transforms as a graph. “The blooms of lotus vibrations represent wisdom,” he says.  Colourful shades of Nature create abstract patterns in PJ Stalin’s creative landscapes. “When seen from an aeroplane, objects on earth appear small, spread out and interwoven in patterns, ” says Stalin whose sculpture on geometric forms engages audiences with its bright colour play.  Sharath Mudupu’s five photographs ‘Panchabhootalu’ metaphorically represent five situations farmers go through. His parents are farmers and his work started over a decade ago as a rural landscape project. “ My focus was to highlight different emotions and the hope farmers still harbour, despite the struggles they face every day,” he says. Pointing to a photograph of a pigeon holding onto a balcony net, he says, “The owner had put thorns so that the birds do not sit at the window. Does this planet belong only to humans.”   Jangaiah Polepogu’s oil painting looks at different stages of human evolution and how early humans used weapons only to hunt for food. “Now countries have nuclear weapons of mass destruction. We have forgotten the horrors of Hiroshima.” His black and white drawings include one of the chimpanzees holding a skull. “Only these are left after the mass destruction. Weapons do not protect a country; only humanity does.”  Ramesh Baikani’s acrylic and oil painting of a baby with a mask and a barcode tells the tale of our times. “We get oxygen for free from Nature but, ironically, we had to buy oxygen during the second wave of COVID-19.” He explores the topic further with a focus on deforestation in a fibre sculpture showing a baby.  Thrigulla Murali’s work shows a truck with a dead car zooming off to the recycler’s bin. With a passion for automobiles, the artist says, “If the automotive sector can spend at least 10 % of the money they spend on research and development, on researching how to recycle and reuse, we can create a sustainable mechanism for transportation.”  Uma Vegesina’s protagonist is a woman conjoined with nature. Her oil on canvas and mixed media and water colour on rice paper depicts a woman with other creatures, flora and fauna suffering and celebrating her life. “The colours, which permeate these works are often resonances of my own emotional state of being,” she says.

The CEO and managing director of DAG, the powerhouse art gallery that debuted two new spaces at Mumbai’s Taj Mahal Palace hotel last weekend, could not have asked for a more opportune guest at his new space. Sachin Tendulkar strolled in on a quiet Thursday morning, as the gallery was putting up its new show, Iconic Masterpieces of Indian Modern Art. The Master Blaster took in the sumptuous paintings, featuring 50 rare and historic works spanning 200 years of art. Billed as the gallery’s most ambitious exhibition till date, it includes many paintings being shown in India for the first time. “It can’t get more iconic than the Taj as an address,” Anand, 51, says. “People walk in who would otherwise not walk into a gallery because they don’t have the time, or they feel intimidated. We get something like 50 visitors a day, whereas in a gallery you get about three or four. The exposure is phenomenal.”  Anand speaks from experience. DAG, founded in New Delhi in 1993, is housed at The Claridges hotel in the capital. Since the lease on the gallery’s old space in Mumbai expired in 2020, Anand had been looking for prime real estate. He found it at the Taj, where it is now housed in two spaces, referred to as DAG 1 and DAG 2, within the hotel’s ground floor retail area. While separated from each other by other stores, the connection works because the spaces have distinct personalities. The former exudes a rich, old world charm replete with dark wood and a library with rare volumes, and will be used to display high end works, while the latter has a more contemporary feel, with archways, large windows and parquet floors. It was after Anand got the Taj spaces that the idea of a show on iconic works of art came to him. “I wanted to do something really special to match the importance of the inaugural spaces,” he says. The opening weekend saw more than 250 people visit on Saturday evening, and on Sunday, author Shobhaa De and her husband Dilip hosted a busy reception, which included Tina Ambani, museum head Tasneem Zakaria Mehta, and a vast array of collectors. Accompanying the show is a lavish two-volume publication, delving into detail on each art work, with contributions by 44 scholars. DAG’s head of publications and exhibitions, Kishore Singh, who spent a year painstakingly curating the show, held a walk through during the opening. He explained that this is the first time that works by western artists — described as orientalists — including Dutch artist Marius Bauer, Paris-based American painter Edwin Lord Weeks, England’s Frank Brooks, and Poland’s Stefan Norblin, were being displayed. The oldest work is an expansive Company painting from 1805 by an anonymous artist of a riverside view of Agra Fort. Singh pointed out its hybrid style, a hallmark of Indian miniaturists commissioned by the East India Company. The work, valued at $1 million, is sold. Singh also highlighted The Poet, a 1938 cement sculpture by Ramkinkar Baij, considered the first modern Indian sculpture, of Rabindranath Tagore’s head, FN Souza’s Seated Nude on a Blue Armchair, MF Husain’s rare landscape of Udaipur, and The Coquette, a beautiful painting attributed to the studio of Raja Ravi Varma.  The most poignant work in the show (not on display in Mumbai, but included in the book) is Nicholas Roerich’s Banner of Peace, possibly the most important painting by the Russian artist, created in 1931 after he moved to India. Roerich, one of India’s nine national artists, had seen many cultural institutions destroyed during World War 1, and wanted to promote peace through culture. “Given what’s happening in the world today, this work is so relevant,” Anand says. Anand stumbled upon art by default. His mother, who enjoyed art, had started the Delhi Art Gallery in 1993. Anand, who was in the ready-made garments business with his brothers, took over from her in 1996. Since he didn’t know much about art, he began travelling across India, spending weeks at a time in Benares, Lucknow, Bikaner, and Kolkata. He went to museums and met artists. “It took me a few years to learn,” he says. “I trained my eye, understood the market, and then systematically started buying art.”  He is clearly passionate, looking at art for up to 15 to 16 hours a day, seven days a week, all year round. “I haven’t taken a vacation in seven years,” he says with a rueful laugh. “I literally have no life!” He gets up to 1,000 phone messages a day, but does not use a computer. And, while he is passionate about art, he is dispassionate about parting with works. “No matter how special I feel about a work, I am a seller,” he explains. “When I sell, the money I make goes back into buying more.” Anand says that DAG has the largest collection of pre-modern and modern Indian art, starting from the 18th century onwards, including antiquarian photography. Since those early days, Anand has grown DAG into a multi-city gallery, with spaces in New Delhi, Mumbai and New York. With a 160-member team, it runs museums (including at the Red Fort called Drishayakala), has a prolific publications division, and does public outreach. One aspect he is proud of developing is DAG’s focus on less represented and less recognised — yet important — Indian artists such as Chittaprosad Bhattacharya, Rabin Mondal and Laxman Pai. The pandemic, which brought digital to the fore, has resulted in DAG launching a comprehensive web platform next month. It will contain information for scholars and students, have film and video, function as a database of 200 artists represented by the gallery, and include thousands of works for sale. Anand says that because selling large, expensive works was challenging in the last two years, as they couldn’t show the works physically, the gallery has also pivoted to lower priced works to reach a wider audience. Today, DAG sells art priced from ₹1 lakh upwards, and this will continue. Going forward, Anand has plans to open a space in Dubai, is exploring venues for institutional shows in Mumbai and Kolkata, and is developing an exhibition on Tipu Sultan. He also wants to put renewed focus on the New York gallery, which he opened in 2015, but feels has not received the attention it deserves. He also has plans to debut an online auction house focussing on works priced at under $10,000. Most of all, he wants to bring art to more people. “95% of the audience is between Delhi and Mumbai; what about the rest of India?” he asks. “This is a big country and more people need to appreciate art. We are trying to create that understanding.”",Gayatri Rangachari Shah,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/ashish-anand-brings-dag-to-the-taj-and-can-finally-take-a-vacation/article65248551.ece
1080,"March 19, 2022",09:59 IST,entertainment,art,Amin Jaffer’s new chapter in Paris," Writer, curator, collaborator, colonial furniture specialist: Amin Jaffer wears his titles effortlessly. And in the last couple of years, he’s added another one — that of Paris denizen — after he uprooted his English life of 25 years to move into a hôtel particulier (a grand townhouse) on Quai Voltaire along the Seine.  The move made sense. An “éminence grise of the international art world”, as an Architectural Digest article calls him (Jaffer is on the cover of the magazine’s 10th anniversary issue this month), he was “spending a lot of time in Venice, and the commute to London was becoming taxing”. But more importantly, his newest project, a private museum for the Al Thani Collection, is in the city, at Place de la Concorde’s Hôtel de la Marine. “Sheikh Hamad bin Abdullah Al Thani was looking for a more permanent place to house the treasures of his collection,” says Jaffer, recalling how at the time, the French government body Centre des Monuments Nationaux was thinking of converting the former storage space for royal tapestries at the Hôtel — a four-year, €132 million restoration project. “They proposed that the Al Thani Collection could exhibit its masterpieces there.” With a 20-year agreement in place, acquiring a Parisian pin code thus gave him a twofold advantage, both with work and keeping up his continental way of life. (The last few weeks alone have seen Jaffer travel to Seville and Carmona in Spain and Parma and Venice in Italy.) The view of the Louvre from his third floor flat definitely tipped the scales in its favour. (The photos he shares on his Instagram, @aminjaffer_curator, are proof enough.) And the fact that Vivant Denon, the first director of the museum, had once been a resident in the 17th century building. Moreover, as he explains in an email that he squeezes in between flights, he’s always had a special connection with the Louvre. As a six-year-old, he had visited the museum with his mum, spending an entire day exploring its rooms, a Polaroid camera clutched tightly in his hands. He still has the photographs. “The adrenalin rush of seeing a great work of art inspired me then — as it does now,” he says, adding how by the time he turned 10 he had visited most of the major museums in Europe. “Other seminal moments include an early visit to the Musée des Beaux-Arts in Brussels and a trip to Rome to see the Vatican collections.” But he nearly missed his calling. Born into an Indian business family in Kigali, Rwanda, a career in art wasn’t an option growing up. His subjects in university were economics and commerce! That is, until he chose the history of French opera and French Renaissance châteaux as his first year electives and reignited his love affair with the arts. Today, Jaffer, who is in his early 50s, is not only the senior curator of the Al Thani Collection, but also works with leading museums around the world in a “curatorial role, focussed on public projects, exhibition programming and producing catalogues”. His resume includes long stints at the V&A Museum in London as curator and as the International Director of Asian Art at Christie’s. “Born in central Africa, educated in Europe and America, I do feel something of a hybrid and I am drawn by works of art that are born from the encounter of two — or more — civilisations,” says Jaffer, who has recently “been fascinated by the fusion of Spanish and Amerindian culture, particularly in the domain of painting”. This ties in beautifully with the Al Thani Collection and its catalogue of more than 5,000 works of art drawn from across world civilisations. It makes us wonder, how important are such private collections in the art world? “Pioneer collectors have vision and resources that compliment the public art offering,” he says, explaining how such collections play a significant role in the programming of national institutions. “Recent examples in Paris [besides the Al Thani Collection] includes the Bourse de Commerce and the Fondation Louis Vuitton. In India, Kiran Nadar has developed a programme of exhibitions around her collection that makes an essential contribution to the art scene,” adds the Indian art expert who played a key part in launching Christie’s first auction in Mumbai in 2013. Jaffer’s personal collection is equally varied. A triptych by Iranian photographer Raza Aramesh, of Afghan refugees sitting in the Versailles’ Hall of Mirrors, takes pride of place in his home office, while a painting of Italian sculptor Benvenuto Cellini’s Medusa by Chinese contemporary artist Yuntao Zhang hangs in the library dining room. Elsewhere, Qing period armchairs, Louis XVI commodes, and Bouke De Vries’ Memory Jars are tucked into corners and under tables. “My most recent passions are French 18th century silver and hardstones from late Antiquity, especially objects in porphyry. I am learning more about Symbolist painting, too,” he says. His days of confinement (as the French called the lockdown) helped broaden his base. When not watching life on the river, he was visiting digital museums and “researching parallel institutions” around the world. “What’s certain,” he says, “is that technology will play a greater role in the way we enjoy works of art — whether through the presence of more immersive, digitally-led exhibitions [such as the RMN Grand Palais’ immersive Venice show opening in autumn] or the sharing of information about works of art through digital platforms [like the one for the Palazzo Pilotta collection in Parma, which he experienced last weekend].” Does this mean he’s also on board with NFTs? “Of course, the phenomenon interests me,” he says, “but I do not yet have sufficient expertise to comment on anything in this new domain.” For now, he’s back at his home at L’Hôtel de Beuvron, listening to Wagner and Mahler, and updating his Instagram. V&A’s new exhibition, Fashioning masculinities — on the male dress and its influences — has caught his eye, though he admits his personal wardrobe is rather formulaic. Tailored clothes in a limited palette of colours is the ‘uniform’, accented by pocket squares and ties that reflect the season or his mood. “Cufflinks are a weakness,” he shares, “and the best ones are by [Indian jeweller] Viren Bhagat, without doubt.” Even as Jaffer immerses himself in life on the Left Bank, work at the museum is keeping up its momentum. “Some substantial pieces have been added to the collection in the past two years, which reflect the diversity of interests [of Sheikh Al Thani]. These will be shared with the public through displays at the Hôtel de la Marine,” he concludes.",Surya Praphulla Kumar,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/amin-jaffers-new-chapter-in-paris/article65235125.ece
1081,"March 19, 2022",00:23 IST,entertainment,art,Cultural connections in Jaipur," Jaipur in March is beautiful, but hot. But I wasn’t letting temperatures just shy of 40° Celsius keep me away from the first onground cultural event of the year, the 15th edition of the Jaipur Literature Festival (JLF). The crowds thronging Clarks Amer hotel, the new venue, to listen to fresh voices such as bureaucrat-author Daribha Lyndem, and literary giants like M Mukundan, seemed to have the same thought. During the day, the strains of bagpipes (wielded by mustachioed men in Rajasthani regalia) accompanied visitors tricked out in headscarves, masks, light jackets and goggles, while the cooler evenings continued the traditions earlier observed at Diggi Palace — with performances by names such as Ujwal Nagar, the Hindustani classical maestro, Sufi singer Mooralala Marwada, Kashmiri singer-songwriter Ali Saffudin, Hindi rock band Ankur & the Ghalat Family, and the Kutle Khan Project. What caught my eye, however, was how the crowds flowed easily between several concurrent cultural events in the city. The key one, besides JLF, was Vita Nova: A New Life, a two-part exhibition showcasing contemporary Italian and Indian art, showcased at both the Jawahar Kala Kendra and the Gyan Museum. Curated by Myna Mukherjee and David Quadrio (and hosted by the Italian Cultural Institute along with the festival organisers), it showcased the works of Andrea Anastasio, Francesco Samiti, Marta Roberti, Puneet Kaushik, Raghava KK and Shilo Shiv Suleman.  “Being married to a painter [Olivia Hamilton-Dalrymple] has meant that I am always interested in the visual arts. And unlike books, which can be read at home or over the internet, art does require a certain physical presence,” said historian, writer and co-founder of JLF William Dalrymple. The bestselling author’s latest book,  Forgotten Masters: Indian Painting for the East India Company, also looks into art. “Now, more than ever, we must support it by going out and seeing it,” he added. At Jawahar Kala Kendra, just 15 minutes away, the atmosphere was participatory, with visitors hanging out with the artists, and even sitting in small, safe groups to discuss their work. “We took Dante’s literature [ Divine Comedy] as inspiration for the two-site exhibition to explore the transformations, connections, and departures between the craft traditions and contemporary art of Italy and India,” said Mukherjee. The pandemic and its impact also synced with the medieval Italian poet’s epic work. At Gyan, a more traffic-heavy half hour away, the artworks were more intimate and sensitive. Puneet Kaushik’s works drew you in with narratives on “identity, stereotypes, gender violence and sexuality”, while Shilo Shiv Suleman’s creations such as  Reclaiming the River — an over 12-foot-long installation that explored the transformative power of rivers — and  Grove, a bejewelled tree that lit up when visitors blew on it, were grand and evocative. It is heartening to see the surge of events across the country, with exhibitions being planned for the next few months. The India Art Fair in Delhi, in late April, is a much-anticipated one. “Who knows what the months after that will bring. Covid-19 and the human condition has proven itself as unpredictable, but we must surge on,” says art historian Alka Pande, who was present at JLF.  Vita Nova is on till March 22.",Georgina Maddox,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/cultural-connections-in-jaipur/article65234468.ece
1082,"March 18, 2022",18:26 IST,entertainment,art,Smruthi Gargi Eswar’s contemporary take on goddesses," An exhibition showcasing Smruthi Gargi Eswar’s artworks to commemorate 20 years of Hyderabad’s Shrishti Art Gallery is titled Devi is in The Detail. The title could not have been more apt; the digital artworks have the potential to make visitors take a fresh look at the way a goddess or Devi is often portrayed.  The Bengaluru-based artist explains how women are socially conditioned and come under stress to be “Devi-like”, but what makes the goddesses in her art relatable is a more fluid representation, similar to normal women. This fluid depiction does not dilute the idea of a goddess; instead, it brings to the fore a lesser-explored facet.  Instead of an image of goddess Saraswathy seated with her veena and blessing her devotees, as seen on calendars and framed images in puja rooms, we see her in an informal mode, as though she is enjoying some time off in the forest. Smruthi was always familiar with mythological stories. She had the basic idea of stories associated with Durga, Saraswathi and Lakshmi and their raw strength and energy. Having grown up in South India, she says, “Dravidian Hindu mythology is different from the pan-Indian approach we see today. Since a part of my family is from rural India, I was also exposed to the concept of village goddesses. When I began a series on goddesses nearly a decade ago, I wanted to be better informed and read up about the goddesses. I realised that stories of gods and goddesses have been retold many times and there are different versions to each story. That made it even more interesting.” One of the artworks titled Gramadevi is a representation of village goddesses. There are several names given to these goddesses in villages across India. The rural deities are worshipped differently by different communities. Smruthi tries to find a commonality among the different versions, taking a few characteristic traits. The local deity is often identified by the image of the head just outside the village, under a tree. Legends have it that feasts are cooked to appease her wrath after the village and the nearby areas bear the brunt of forest fires. “There was a time when these deities were tended to by women of the area and not by priests,” says Smruthi. Each of her artworks — depicting Gauri, Prakriti, Matangi, among others — narrate a story. Parvati covering her face with a lotus harks back to the story of the Lingam and the Yoni. Elsewhere we learn about Tara, the goddess for travellers, and Akka Mahadevi, the 12th-century mystic who was devoted to Lord Shiva. The artist’s portrayal of Ganga and Arthanarishwari are also examples of an exploration of multiplicity.  Some of these artworks are a part of Smruthi’s continuing series Sister Misfortune that began a decade ago when she started exploring and depicting goddesses who are not revered or dismissed as ‘alakshmi’, the opposite of Lakshmi. Smruthi studied fine arts at the Baroda Faculty of Fine Arts and Chitrakala Parishad. Her interest in art, though, emerged when she was a student at The Valley School, KFI. She then worked as a graphic artist for a few years before returning to fine arts. She preferred the digital art form for her series on goddesses. The vibrant colours and a contemporary calendar mood was accentuated by going digital. She adds, “I found it elitist that a painting will be owned by one person. Digital art is democratisation of that process.”  Ensuring that the value of her art does not get diluted, she makes limited edition copies. “I make 10 copies and then delete the source file,” she says, referring to how she took a cue from early photographers and lithographers who destroyed the negatives and originals so that the imagery is not replicated over and over. Destroying the original file was hurtful initially, she admits and adds that with time, she found it cathartic to let go. Once the high-resolution source file is destroyed, she is only left with a few low resolution images that she uses for tarot cards.

1083,"March 18, 2022",18:00 IST,entertainment,art,Exhibiting a connect between tech and urban life in Bengaluru," An exhibition on the theme ‘Smarter Digital Realities: Tech and the City’ is being held by the Sandbox Collective in association with the Goethe-Institut/Max Mueller Bhavan over the weekend in Bengaluru. This exhibition was curated by Padmini Ray Murray, founder of Design Beku, a collective that explores how technology and design can be decolonial, local, and ethical.  Padmini, speaking on the phone from Bengaluru, says, “Artists have examined the relationship between technology and the city, and how the former has transformed the latter.” She continues, “This project was conceived before the pandemic. However, the lockdown forced artists and creative practitioners to find novelty and inspiration in everyday monotony. Technology played a huge role in the experience of the pandemic, especially in the metropolitan cities.” This residency was initially conducted online, with artists in Bombay, Bangalore, Pune and Dhaka, contributing works that emerged from a few weeks of workshops. The final works were showcased in an online environment and a series of online events marked the launch of the exhibition space.  As pandemic restrictions have eased, it was decided to bring these artworks to a larger audience, in a more traditional exhibition format. The works include an evocative, interactive narrative on belonging in the city, a glitchy immersive sonic commentary on Bengaluru nightlife, a visual meditation on the role balconies played during our enforced months indoors and a collaborative project with waste-pickers and manual scavengers depicting the oppression of non-dominant castes in the city, among others.  The exhibition is held at the Bangalore International Centre on March 19, 20, between 11 am and 7 pm. Entry is free for all.

1084,"March 18, 2022",14:57 IST,entertainment,art,"From Holi to Eid, festivals are used as a trope to examine people and society in Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s films"," As winter paved way for spring and Holi rushed in, the energetic garba number ‘Dholida’ from the recently released  Gangubai Kathiawadi came to mind, where the trance-ridden eponymous heroine swirls and splashes colour in that famous single-shot scene.  With that, I also recalled another colour-suffused frame from the film  Ram-Leela (2013), that introduces the female lead Leela by choreographing her in a vivacious Holi setting. The two scenes are not merely festive portrayals but explorations of suppressed and evolving human emotions. While the former allows Gangubai to process her rage and grief of many years as a prostitute, the second presents Padukone’s character Leela as a free-spirited woman, seconds before encountering her lover for the first time. In Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s cinema, celebrations of all kinds routinely develop a politics of their own, offering high points of togetherness, intrigue and even resistance. Take for instance ‘Dola Re Dola’ in  Devdas (2002), where Paro and Chandramukhi dance together on Durga Puja. It is an occasion that provides a unique (if momentary) freedom to the latter from her confined life as a courtesan, simultaneously striking a deep friendship with a woman of “respectable” class.  This motif is replayed in  Bajirao Mastani’s (2015) ‘Pinga’ performance that brings together Kashibai and Mastani during a festival honouring womanhood. In  Padmaavat (2018), Diwali celebrations become an event to illustrate the fortitude of Raja Ratan Singh. As his kingdom prepares for the impending assault of Allaudin Khilji’s army, the Raja orders his men to celebrate the festival with such fervour that would break Khilji’s morale. Contrary to the view that holds Bhansali as Islamophobic (a position that gained much traction in the aftermath of  Padmaavat’s release), the director complexly focuses on Islamicate aesthetics in a number of his films, again through the prism of celebration. The festival of Eid, for instance, is depicted with intricacy and bonhomie in films like  Saawariya (2007) and  Gangubai Kathiawadi, transforming into a meeting ground for separated lovers and fresh alliances. Thus, it is on Eid that the Hindu Gangubai seeks partnership in the Muslim Karim Lala’s business, strengthening their sibling bond even further. And it is also during Eid that Sakina meets her parted lover Imaan in  Saawariya, a film that is entirely structured around events leading to the festival. Such festive organisation of temporality is also visible in  Ram-Leela which begins with Holi and ends with Diwali. Likewise, an Anglo-Indian sensibility also finds sustained attention in films like  Khamoshi (1996),  Black (2005),  Guzaarish (2010) and  Saawariya. True to his forte, Bhansali doesn’t limit the expression of celebration only to the depiction of festivals, but instead extrapolates it to evoke a special regard for everyday life. The piano foyer of Lillipop in  Saawariya and Ethan’s radio broadcasting room in  Guzaarish thus ripen into wondrous, joyful spaces, celebrating the magic of music.  Musical enjoyment again comes to the fore in a spectacular atmospheric shot from  Black that marks the passage of the protagonist Michelle McNally into a young woman. Here, the deaf and blind Michelle is seen enjoying the music fully by running her fingers on the shifting vocal chords of a dazzling jazz performer, subverting the very idea of “hearing” music by “touching” it. Yet, the spirit of celebration remains as alive as ever and attests to the success of Michelle’s education by her teacher, a relationship that constitutes the crux of the story. But even as Bhansali repeatedly finds magnificence, intimacy and renewed meaning in special and sundry festive settings, the idea of celebration simultaneously — and perhaps most crucially — allows him to connect with the great masters of Hindi cinema and carry forward their legacy to the present. Whether they are the films of K. Asif, Kamal Amrohi, Raj Kapoor, V. Shantaram or Guru Dutt, Bhansali compulsively references their universes along with many other filmic and non-filmic works.  So while on one level,  Saawariya is about Eid, on another, it is also a celebration of Raj Kapoor’s dialogues and Guru Dutt’s characters and cinematography. Similarly, a number of songs and motifs of  Bajirao Mastani and  Gangubai Kathiawadi are heavily reminiscent of  Mughal-E-Azam,  Pakeezah, and cinema of the 50s and 60s. It is impossible not to hear the notes of ‘Teri Mehfil Mein’ and ‘Mohabbat Ki Jhooti Kahaani’ from  Mughal-E-Azam in  Gangubai’s layered qawwali ‘Shikayat’, performed during a heartbreak and marriage. The imprint of V. Shantaram’s experimentation with colour, dance sequences and evocative architecture is likewise visible in the entire corpus of the filmmaker. Far from being a mere decorative ploy, celebration evolves into a multifaceted trope allowing the auteur director to relate both to the memory of Hindi cinema and the festive roots of Indian culture. Through a ceaseless experimentation with song, dance and everyday materiality in heightened, operatic terms, Bhansali keeps alive the essential spirit of  anand that defines our collective identity.

1085,"March 18, 2022",13:57 IST,entertainment,art,More Hoysala monuments in Karnataka are queuing up for world heritage site tag," The Hoysala temples at Belur, Halebeedu and Somanathapura are India’s official nominations for inclusion as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, but a few more temples belonging to the same period could join the list in future.  The serial nomination process provides for extension of sites under the same category if the new site meets the UNESCO’s criteria of displaying outstanding universal value besides sharing the same attributes as that of the monuments that were originally included as World Heritage Sites. Both Belur and Halebeedu have been in the tentative list since 2014. They were nominated as ‘The Sacred Ensembles of the Hoysalas’ to which the Keshava temple at Somanathapura was included as part of the serial nomination process. The three monuments await the final declaration as a UNESCO site. If the monuments are approved for inclusion as a World Heritage Site, they will be collectively viewed as a single nomination, with the new ones being an extension of the original property. UNESCO defines serial nominations as any two or more unconnected sites that may contain a series of cultural or natural properties in different locations, provided they are related because they belong to the same historical and cultural group.  As many as 14 forts in Maharashtra were clubbed for serial nomination as ’Maratha Military Architecture’, and is under UNESCO’s tentative list since one year.  Sources in the State Department of Archaeology, Museums and Heritage said a provisional list of the temples that have the potential to be included as world heritage sites had been drawn up when the final dossier for the Hoysala monuments was being prepared.  The original list, which was prepared in 2019 had 14 Hoysala monuments from which only the Keshava temple at Somanathapura was included in the final dossier.  The other temples in the list include Panchalingeshwara temple at Govindahall,  Kesava temple at Harnahalli, Lakshminarayana temple at Hosaholalu, Ishvara temple at Arsikere, Bucheshwara temple at Koravangala, Nageshwara and Chennakeshava temple at Mosale, Kalyani at Hulikere, Lakshmidevi temple at Doddagaddavalli, Amriteshwara temple and Viranarayana temple at Amrutpura. Pankaj Modi, an architect who was among those involved in preparation of the dossier, said they have pruned the list to include only three sites but, going forward, other sites too could be included subject to the sites fulfilling the UNESCO criteria. He is hoping that the Karnataka Government would come forward with a plan for management of these sites.   The immediate challenge before the authorities is to prepare a master plan for management of Somanathapura; a master plan for both Belur and Halebeedu has already been prepared.  Officials said in case of Somanathapura, the Archaeological Survey of India had issued a notification banning all activities within a radius of 100 metres of the monument. ‘’Only the guidelines have to be prepared. They could be the template for preparation of the master plan as well,” an official said.",R.

1086,"March 18, 2022",12:08 IST,entertainment,art,"The warriors of Patkai hills: Pablo Bartholomew’s photographs in the exhibition, The Nagas, are a crash course in anthropology"," To the unsuspecting eye, five little brass ‘faces’ fashioned into a pendant, held together with colourful beads and strings, would probably be just a fascinating necklace. But photographer Pablo Bartholomew says that those brass faces might represent the number of human heads taken by the Naga warrior who wears the necklace. Bartholomew knows what he is talking about — for over 10 years, he has journeyed deep into Naga territory, often alone, to learn more about their lives and culture.  The photographs he took there between 1989 and 2000 have been brought together in the ongoing exhibition The Nagas, presented by Nine Fish Art Gallery & Dot Line Space in Byculla, Mumbai. Interspersed with the photographs are Naga artefacts from the Great Eastern Home collection of Anurag Kanoria, founder of Nine Fish Gallery. The large wooden sculptures, furniture and ceremonial jewellery (like the necklace) add to the show’s immersiveness.  The term ‘Nagas’ is used to describe the 30-plus tribes who live along the Patkai mountain range, which spills over several geopolitical boundaries. Despite the umbrella term, the Nagas are a diverse people speaking over 60 dialects. The broad Naga identity typifies a proud people, who continue to hold on to their own constitution and flag.  Braving dangers Spurred on by the stories he had heard as a young boy from his father, the art critic and photographer Richard Bartholomew, Pablo took time off from his career as a photojournalist in the 1990s to document the many living and dying traditions of the Nagas. Travelling in his modified jeep, which would serve as mobile studio, generator van and equipment carrier, Bartholomew braved the dangers not just of unknown terrains, wild animals and secretive tribes, but also the constant low-level war-like situation between Naga insurrectionists and Indian armed forces. He recalls one such hazardous journey he made to photograph the Tangkhul Nagas in their spectacular lion headdresses, which are adorned with hornbill feathers, a brass dish and human hair, with a jaw-piece made of wood embedded with red and white seeds. Worn specifically by men of the Northern Tangkhul tribe of India and Myanmar, they symbolise male courage, strength and virility.  Front-row view “To make this set of images, I had to drive to a remote border village without a proper road. The drive was all downhill. I had chosen to drive late evening to avoid detection by local authorities and security forces because otherwise I would have needed multiple permissions. Driving in the dark, following the illegal logging truck tracks, I could not see much of the landscape, only what showed in the headlights. When I finally found the village, which had no electricity, the villagers were shocked to see me alone in my vehicle. No outsider had ever dared to venture into their village before. They gave me food and shelter for the night. I explained to them what I wanted to photograph and with their cooperation the next morning, made the images I wanted. I then made the return journey uphill, back to the Imphal-Jessami-Kohima Road, which led me to another adventure — a story for another day.” Resilient beauty Bartholomew, a Padma Shri and l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres awardee, is possibly one of the few outsiders to have witnessed certain Naga cultural practices, many of which have now been outlawed. One such is headhunting which, though banned by the British, symbolised a certain martial power and virility that still define the Naga tribes. Through the photographs, one gets a front-row view of amazing sights like a hut full of human skulls, a mock-battle ritual called mangpa, the ceremonial installation of log drums that occurs only once in 30-50 years, or the raising of a megalith. Amid the extravagant displays of hypermasculinity, Bartholomew’s images of Naga women in their everyday lives stand out, as they tend to their children, farm or domestic chores or enjoy a few rare moments to themselves. Although, as anthropologist Dolly Kikon points out, the concept of the “empowered Naga woman” is a myth, Naga society being essentially patriarchal, the women in the photographs radiate a resilient beauty.  From the nature-inspired homes of the Nagas to their warrior rituals; from their music, dance and sculpture to their headhunting practice; from their elaborate costumes and jewellery to their rigid social hierarchies, the exhibition is a veritable crash course in Naga anthropology. The photos are accompanied by detailed captions and a video, although just the visual takeaway is also incredibly rich. ON SHOW: The Nagas, Nine Fish Art Gallery, Byculla, Mumbai, till April 10.

1087,"March 17, 2022",15:14 IST,entertainment,art,Six more walls in Chennai’s Kannagi Nagar will sport new murals," Some may call it surrealist: while serenity washes over a face sporting a nose ring, an explosion of feathers, punctuated by houses in blue, green, yellow, orange and pink fills the facade. Indentations in the form of windows, doors and the occasional crack are the negative spaces of this concrete canvas.  Part of this face today is masked by clothes hung out to dry, as children of the locality play a game of tag, snapping us back to the reality of one of the largest resettlement areas in Tamil Nadu — Kannagi Nagar. Here, as daily life unfolds, yet another wall stands in the background narrating a story through colour.  Kannagi Nagar and its people are now used to the drill. In 2019, before the pandemic struck, St+art India saw the identical apartment buildings as empty canvases. With People and Environment as the theme, artists from across the country and abroad adorned 16 facades in the locality, making it India’s fifth Art District.  From Australian artist Bronte Naylor to Chennai’s own A-Kill and Delhi-based Osheen Siva among others, they captured Kannagi Nagar and the larger Tamil culture in bits and pieces. The initiative supported by Greater Chennai Corporation, Asian Paints and Tamil Nadu Urban Habitat Development Board also aided workshops for the community, culminating in a launch programme where beatboxers, hip hop dancers and gaana singers drew crowds to this otherwise neglected area.  Cut to March 2022, six more walls have been draped in colour as the third edition begins. While the theme remains the same, a new roster of seven national and international artists will take over the walls, all through the month of March.  “The fact that Kannagi is so cut off from the centre of the city, but also is confined somehow in a purely urban level, makes the community bind together stronger. And so, such cultural interventions are more accepted,” says Guilia Ambrogi, co-founder and curator of St+art India. She adds, “The murals have been very contextual right from the beginning, to its environment. How do we make that sustainable and valuable to everyone is the question we are asking ourselves.” While art workshops have been done in the past, over the course of their work, the team has identified how important dance and music is to the community. Now besides art, workshops pertaining to performance will also be held. Another key focus is on teaching the children about consent. In an attempt to capture pandemic travel, through metaphors and motifs that represent local flora and fauna, Greta von Richthofen from Germany and Aashti Miller from India have done a collaborative mural in Lodhi Art District, Delhi, and Kannagi Nagar. The wall art, which connects across cities through overlapping ideas and motifs, is part of the #GraphicTravelogues initiative done in collaboration with Goethe-Institut.  Explaining how they have used the body as a link, Aashti says, “In Chennai we have depicted the head, out of which ideas flow and in both murals we have incorporated a lot of local and German elements. For instance, the flowers talk about floral trade specific to the city.” In Delhi, a pencil in hand characterises the mural. Birds and trees that embody Germany’s biodiversity also make an appearance. Speaking of the edition, Aashti continues, “The beauty of the Chennai murals is that a lot of the artists take inspiration from the ‘here and now’. It is a very common practice, and creatively stimulating.”  The concept behind this wall also touches upon “travelling in one’s own mind.”  While most of the ideation happened virtually, Greta says, “It was a very fluid and interesting process for us. Both of us have extremely different styles and aesthetics and that worked out.”  Another wall in-the-works is sprinkled with what may seem like chat stickers, at the first glance. Go closer to realise that these emoticons are characters from the locality itself. “Among the emoticons, you can find people from Kannagi: while plucking flowers, collecting water…This mural localised such a global way of communication which especially rose in importance during the pandemic,” says Guilia. Afzan Pirzade, Lekha Shastri, Mohd Intiyaz, Chifumi from Cambodia and Datta Raj are the other artists at work. For artists and curators alike, Kannagi Nagar’s people form the core of their work. Guilia reassures, “We are trying to act on multiple levels towards a larger goal. We don’t want to create just a spectacle, but also see tangible effects by working with the community.”   ",Gowri S,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/chennais-kannagi-nagar-sports-six-new-murals/article65230196.ece
1088,"March 16, 2022",11:07 IST,entertainment,art,An art nook in Kochi is bringing women artists together," In June 2021, when Victoria A M opened her studio — which had been closed for several months due to the lockdowns — she found that the enforced closure and the monsoon rains had caused much devastation. “I was mentally destroyed,” she recalls. Her series of paintings on the Kerala Floods of 2018, which was to have been her entry to the Lokame Tharavadu show, had been ravaged. A devastated Victoria gathered the mouldy water-stained canvases and torched them. She remembers “those terrible days when there was no income”. Then she contracted COVID-19. But at a time, “when things were coming apart”, Victoria found hope in “my angels”, a new series of works on those who helped her during these dark days. In her 60s, Victoria says that life has been hard for women artists, especially during the pandemic. In the beginning of 2022, she began Advent, a series of works by women artists at Namasthe Art Cener, her 160-sq.ft space in Mattancherry. Her only trouble in this hired space is the lack of a toilet. Victoria hopes her health will permit her to host women artists as frequently as possible. After Advent -3, Austria based Malayali artist Deepa Chandran Ram is to exhibit her works. She also plans to have art camps for women. So far, around 25 artists — ranging from college students to senior artists — have exhibited their works and the third edition of Advent is ongoing. The continuous shows have rallied the women into a sisterhood of support, solace and professional energy. “I am happy that my space has become a rallying place for women artists,” says Victoria. “They exhibit their works, meet, chat, find support and comfort and many launch themselves from here. It’s very satisfying.” Radha Gomathy, who was at Victoria’s side during her fight, commends the latter’s bravery in the face of extreme adversity. “I remember talking to her about payment of electricity bills and of art at the same time,” smiles Victoria. Anu Zafran, who is exhibiting four works, found Victoria through a women’s group on WhatsApp. “It was a brave move to give us the gallery, her time and effort. As women, we have to find support for ourselves and Victoria is an inspiration. She has kept afloat and going despite all her problems,” says Anu, adding that initially she felt diffident about expressing herself but such a group and gallery gives her confidence.  Sandhyambika, a self-taught artist and professional banker, says her work ‘Thottavadi’ or Touch me Not is a about her being labelled thus. The work which has squirrels and birds among the plants is about the strength of a woman. “The plant is strong and so are women,” says the artist. Mural artist Lekha Vyloppilly, whose works draw from Indian tradition, is pleased to be part of Advent. Though she does not identify with “gender tags” in art, she feels that such initiatives go a long way in supporting women. Though the sales from the shows have not resulted in substantial transactions (there were four sales in the first edition), Victoria has been drawing buyers to her small and cosy nook.    As a school girl in her Sree Moolagramam, she was noticed for her “special drawings” but art was not a field to be chosen as a career, and certainly not for girls. She went on to study Sanskrit and philosophy. When Victoria came to Kochi as a bride, 40 years ago, she had to set aside her passion for art to be a homemaker. Though she didn’t touch a paintbrush for 10 years, her husband (photographer Boney Keyar) and her father-in-law, artist -photographer, K R Antony, encouraged her to learn. She recalls telling her husband that it was paints she craved for, not a sari. In the early 1990s she participated in a group show. Her entry, ‘The elephant bath’, was an unframed work “on a piece of paper stuck on the wall” at Maulana Azad Library in Kochi. This was followed by another group show at Maharaja’s College. Later Victoria worked as an art teacher and looked after Captain Ludwig’s Cochin Art Gallery at Princess Street in Fort Kochi, where her talent was recognised. She also worked with the Cochin Corporation for five years on their women and children scheme. Awareness programmes at grassroot level. She also began writing poetry and co-authored an anthology with German artist Lieselotte Stieger. Women have been the subject of Victoria’s works, and this continues in her role as gallerist. “I have women’s interests in mind. I like the subject: women and children,” says Victoria gazing at the bright pink bougainvillea flowers outside her gallery.",Priyadershini S,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/an-art-nook-in-kochi-is-bringing-women-artists-together/article65207243.ece
1089,"March 14, 2022",12:40 IST,entertainment,art,Alappuzha artist crafts toys out of palm leaves," John Baby twists and folds a long strip of coconut palm leaf. In a few minutes, he transforms the strip into an elegant grasshopper. He soon makes another and the two grasshoppers look like they are ready to leap. It began years ago, when John started making toys for his children Minon and Minto, both of whom were homeschooled. “My wife and I did not want to give them plastic toys, so I had to make whatever they asked for using palm leaves. This included excavators, which they liked.” Born in Harippad in Alappuzha, John spent his childhood playing in fields. His father, a farmer and businessman, took him around on his travels and John learnt the art of crafting from the workers in the fields, who used to weave palm leaves to make mats. “Everything that man has built today began with the hands. Creating something by hand is a primal thing. Every human being has this innate ability. It is just that we have grown far away from it. We swipe on our mobile phones with our fingertips, we do not create anything new with them.” Up until the pandemic, he used to take classes in crafting at the Kerala State Institute of Design. John conducts workshops for children and adults. “Working with hands sparks creativity. It helps one eliminate laziness.” John speaks of the meditative quality of crafting. Working with hands instills patience, concentration, a sense of tolerance and a habit of hard work, he says. “If children are initiated into crafting at an early age, they would be able to pick up these qualities. Resorts and hotels that organise sustainable events using eco-friendly products often seek John’s help to make decor products out of leaves. Currently living in an apartment in Kochi, John says palm leaves are not as easy to come by. He is planning a few workshops for children and adults this summer.     ",Anasuya Menon,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/alappuzha-artist-crafts-toys-out-of-palm-leaves/article65186432.ece
1090,"March 13, 2022",13:24 IST,entertainment,art,Colours of the forest people," Women and Nature have been the subjects of Paris Mohan Kumar’s canvases for more than four decades. “Artists have a moral obligation to engage in tribal causes,” says the veteran artist. His ongoing show ‘Women and Nature’ at David Hall, Fort Kochi, also showcases agro-products cultivated and produced by forest tribes, like the Paniyar tribe, under his guidance. A line of pickles using traditional tribal recipes and clay tableware made by the forest dwellers are a part of the exhibition. The proceeds will be used for the welfare of tribals. Mohan Kumar , who lives an itinerant life working with tribal communities in the hills of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala, has painted 60 large, strong and colourful works. An environmentalist and activist, he launched Kattil Agro during the pandemic. Under this initiative, he trains and guides tribals to cultivate rice, millets and vegetables and produce organic honey. Mohan Kumar works primarily with the forest communities in Devar Gadda and Korome in Kerala’s Wayanad and Kolli Hills in Namakkal, Tamil Nadu. He has raised funds to introduce scientific irrigation techniques and value-added agro-products for retail. Some of the unique food products the community makes include items like a spicy dried green banana peel, which he says, is “eaten like chips”, tomato powder, a dish with lotus root, another with wild chundakki (turkey berry), recipes using 42 varieties of leaves, and dishes with different types of rice. He has created 22 such recipes using local knowledge. “I have lived with the forest people and have complete data of their way of life — the food they eat, what they drink, the language they speak, their changing dialects, and habits,” says Mohan who declares that while educating the forest dwellers is good, they must be urged to not abandon their natural way of life. “It’s important they know that agriculture is not a bad thing; that it can give them a livelihood. Give them a pen but also encourage them to touch the soil,” he says. Mohan Kumar also works with some cave dwellers and provides them with rice and grains. “These people are not on the electoral list and therefore not important to the powers that be,” he says candidly. Mohan Kumar paints from several makeshift studios, many of which are mud huts in the forest. The titles of his works — Life of a Woman, Ursula, The Soul of Nature, Blue moon, The Shrouded Woman, A Caucasian Woman, The Rainbow Woman — are created around his experiences with women and Nature. According to him, women are safest in nature.  In 1988 Mohan Kumar was recognized by UNESCO as one among the 40 greatest living artists.  ‘Women and Nature’ concludes on March 15. e.",Priyadershini S,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/colours-of-the-forest-people/article65204068.ece
1091,"March 11, 2022",17:05 IST,entertainment,art,Animal instincts: Viraj Khanna on his second solo show," Gone are the tragi-comic humans that peopled artist and designer Viraj Khanna’s first solo last year. Now, at Tao Art Gallery in Mumbai, in a show curated by the young Sanjana Shah — who is taking over the family business of art — the 26-year-old finds that a fashionably dressed elephant surrounded by flowers and butterflies can get the viewer’s attention just as well.  In What My Mother Didn’t Teach Me… & Some Things She Did!, “the [zoomorphic] sculptures and paintings with their exaggerated features and multiple faces depict a behavioural adaptation due to the influences of society. There is a constant battle between our raw, natural, and conditioned forms”, explains the artist, who follows the works of Kaws, Jeff Koons and Javier Calleja. “Eventually, the artwork reflects my life and its influences.” Tapping into vulnerability His paintings have moved from canvas collages to paper, with Viraj building up the narrative using different elements from magazines, encyclopaedias, and other books. “I have been thinking a lot about my work after my first show and it has made me bolder in my approach. I’ve reflected on the idea of ‘vulnerability’, with stronger imagery depicted through the figurative elements of the artwork,” he says. “The new introduction of textile is also helping portray visually the way I look at things.” For his 2021 show at the Loft Quest Mall Kolkata (hosted by Art Exposure), he had refrained from using textile because the gallery had advised him not to venture into it. “This was done to keep a separate identity [for me] as an artist and a designer,” says Viraj, who has a fashion label with his twin brother, Vishesh. But with his mother, fashion designer Anamika Khanna’s association with textile and embroidery, it has always spilled over into his life. Why collages, though? Viraj believes that if masters like Picasso and Braque used collage to express themselves, then he can, too! “I think collage as a medium really helps to bridge the gap between an idea and its execution. It gives you something extra to work with and constantly innovate,” he concludes. ‘What My Mother Didn’t Teach Me… & Some Things She Did!’ opens at Tao Art Gallery on February 25 and will go on till April 3.",Georgina Maddox,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/animal-instincts-viraj-khanna-second-solo-show/article65211024.ece
1094,"March 09, 2022",16:05 IST,entertainment,art,Chennai’s iconic Binny Mills now becomes an accompaniment for art," As you drive into SPR Origine on Perambur Barracks Road, inside to your left is a posh complex of villas and outside on the right is the majestic sprawl of Binny Mills, the bits not yet torn down for development. The visual contrast is so arresting that for a moment it seems as if this locale were itself a gigantic art installation. So, it is apposite that it is on the second floor, in a room with a sweep of glass that looks down at Binny Mills, that one finds the heart of the Within|Without exhibition mounted in a vacant villa on former mill land. In 2011, in an antique shop, photographer N Prasannakumar had stumbled upon an old, cracked drawing of Binny Mills made by a Leipzig-based industrial draughtsman, and the yellowing page of a document recording how 20-odd acres of military land was given to Binny & Co. in 1928. Now, Prasanna has converted these into two cyanotype prints that evoke a conversation across eras that is immensely moving. The poster is printed on cotton fabric that is as close as possible to a Binny Mills original while the deed is printed on William Turner 100% cotton paper from Hahnemühle FineArt. The original cyan of the print has been toned with green tea and coffee for a muted shade that evokes the associations of a blueprint even as the prints themselves morph into a statement about image-making as an activity that embeds time and memory, presents and pasts, presences and absences into it. The drawing mirrors the bits of the mill that survive outside the window, becoming an intense experience of intimacy and distance; a simultaneous encounter with remembering and forgetting, creating and erasing that conjures one of those rare art moments of perfect roundness. On the floor below, Pravin Kannanur’s acrylics on canvas reinvoke ideas of the circle as a search for meaning. The works are from his Core series with their myriad parabolic spirals that spin outwards from a heart of colour. Although only Score 3 is from the performance project he did where movement and musical scores fused, the other pieces also suggest sound moving and dissolving in centrifugal waves. In the best pieces, the colours make poised and confident ripples. The whorls and rings strongly suggest the Fibonacci effect, and Pravin says the concept underlies each piece. Can the artist harness the power in some of these works or will he be caught in the vortex of a recurrent idea — these are questions he will soon have to confront. The ground floor displays two artists whose works share affinities. Bhagwan Chavan’s layered oils, like the 2017 canvas that I will call ‘Shipwreck’, or the 40” by 38” in suffused blues and oranges show him at his best, but his recent move to acrylic is shaky. There is a distinct loss of presence and personality that might be discomfort with medium or the fractured mood of the pandemic. He shares the floor with John Tun Sein’s abstracts. Explaining the theme, Coimbatore-based artist Jitha Karthikeyan speaks of spaces redefined by the lockdowns, the blurring of home, work and leisure lines, and all the things made unavailable to us. The show thus is meant to speak to notions of ‘without’ and ‘within’ and their many manifestations. One problem with curation these days is that the concept often seems built post-facto, after artists get together with existing works, and then shoe-horned into place. One is wary, therefore, of curatorial intent. Two artists seem out of sync: M Siva, whose interesting mixed-media exploration of vahanas seems adrift in this show, and the talented Natesh Muthuswamy who is now unwell. The works chosen from his oeuvre, with the sparrow as theme, have not aged well and sit uncomfortably. The idea of ‘spaces’ then is perhaps best served by the venue. Seeing works inside the setting of a deluxe home makes excellent sense for art buyers, while the history of the place lends much drama to the art.

1096,"March 04, 2022",17:06 IST,entertainment,art,Forest of images at the Egmore Museum in Chennai," Do art exhibitions have to be confined to the white cube of a gallery? Do structures need a designated entry and exit? Does the sharing of public spaces put paid to fluid movement or a sense of intuitiveness? It’s a no, to all. At the Government Museum in Egmore, a series of vertical and horizontal metal pieces in the tree-lined promenade play with people’s perspectives as they walk in. With no clearly demarcated beginning or end, or entry or exit, as you walk through A Land of Stories — a photo exhibition by students across Tamil Nadu that’s part of the Chennai Photo Biennale (CPB) — the porous, maze-like structure becomes a part of the experience.  “We devised the installation as a double life,” explains Deepak Jawahar, co-founder of Chennai-based space design studio The Architecture Story (TAS). “When you are inside it, you are immersed in the art and it gives you a sense of movement through it. But when you are outside it, at the museum or on the busy flyover beyond the wall, it becomes something striking, something a bit abstract that catches your eye as you go about your everyday routine.”  The modularity of the structure was created keeping in mind CPB’s aim for it to be a travelling exhibition — they plan to take it to different schools across the state and perhaps even to the Indian Art Fair. “So, it has 40 vertical pieces and an almost equal number of horizontal pieces that you can quickly disassemble, store and move wherever you want,” says Jawahar. The panels are positioned in a series of L shapes. “There is a panel to your left and front, but nothing to the back and the right. In some ways, it’s like a Piet Mondrian painting!” Spatial design is at the core of TAS. “A lot of our work, whether it’s designing a house, an installation or a public project like this [internally, they call the design the Forest of Images], always engages with the idea of the human body and how it engages with space,” says co-founder Justine De Penning, who also runs The Grid, the co-working space in RA Puram. “That’s why we don’t want to create defined spaces.” We saw this at the duo’s earlier installations too, such as Seven Voids at 2019’s Magnetic Fields Festival of Contemporary Music and Arts. Another modular design — with trusses and trampolines — it took inspiration from the Indian charpai, and explored the bed as a social space that encourages playing, resting and socialising.  Are these fluid spaces where they see design heading? “It’s too soon for us to make a presumption about how design is changing now, especially in light of the pandemic. But there is definitely a larger push to create something that is extraordinary even in ordinary situations,” says Jawahar. “There is so much going on online, so if you were to make the effort to go somewhere and do something, it has to give you that extraordinary feeling. So the questions for designers is ‘what is life beyond convenience?’”  De Penning expects to see this evolution happening in all aspects of design. “When you think of retail, everything is moving in an immersive direction. That’s kind of where the future is,” she concludes.

1097,"March 02, 2022",15:58 IST,entertainment,art,Student photographers capture Tamil Nadu and its stories on smartphones," The soft afternoon sun, amid the early onset of summer, veils the Government Museum in a translucent golden hue. One of the city’s favourite venues is back to its pre-pandemic glory, as students once again lounge outside the Connemara Public Library with a book or two, and parents walk in with their little ones for a quick afternoon walkabout. The beloved museum premises once again stands as a world apart, right in the heart of the busy city, surrounded by the relentless weekday traffic: a sight reminiscent of happier, mask-less times.  While the iconic Museum Theatre remains closed, owing to renovations scheduled for the year, other parts of the premises have seen some welcome changes. It now houses an open air theatre (OAT), an exhibition space called Hub that sits comfortably under a canopy of trees, and Plaza: a lounging area in front of Connemara Library. Hub today holds vignettes from all over the State, as photographs captured by Tamil Nadu’s young talent are exhibited in large format prints. Nestled under the trees, A Land of Stories — the showcase organised by Goethe-Institut and Chennai Photo Biennale, helmed by 40 students from across Tamil Nadu — is the first event the space has seen since its completion in March 2021.  
From the colorful Koyambedu market at wee hours to the tilled farmlands of Thanjavur and the birds of Puducherry, the display comprises images clicked on smartphones by children of Government and private schools in the State mentored by the Chennai Photo Biennale’s education wing over the pandemic.  Eighteen-year-old M Anusha, from Chennai’s Ajay Higher Secondary School of the Hearing Impaired, enthusiastically signs to us about her love for the Millenium Park and Koyambedu market, where she found most of her subjects: be it the leaves that create an unintentional web of green or the rows of bright red tomatoes that foreground a vegetable shop. An interpreter translates, “The patterns on colorful butterflies, and the many flowers and plants have always attracted me.” She vows to continue clicking wherever she goes. As for 13-year-old Tanijasri from Vidya Mandir, Mylapore, the most challenging aspect of her brilliant shot of the reflection of a decrepit ferris wheel at Marina Beach, was the fact that the water wouldn’t hold still.  “It was easier to shoot on a phone but the water kept moving! Nowadays, wherever I go, I make sure to keep clicking,” says Tanijasri who has been training with CPB since 2020. Fourteen-year-old Santino R Samurai’s frame that illustrates “a farmer’s day-to-day life” was shot in the paddy fields of Thanjavur where his grandmother lives. The young talent is also freelancing for clients.  Sixteen-year-old Raksita Rajagopal’s preoccupation with the dogs and cats in her neighbourhood comes through in many of her frames — she points to one and says with a laugh, “His name is Corgi though, but he is not a corgi.” Rakshita continues, “From a very young age, I used to feed the dogs in my street. I grew very fond of them over the years. And they became my subjects.” One particularly striking image shows a cat, holding a dignified pose with a coat as black as the night, perched between pink and blue-coloured columns and walls of adjoining apartments. The contrast is laudable.   “This is the third time that we are doing a public show with the kids and this is the biggest one yet,” says Gayatri N, head of education at CPB. She adds that the collaboration saw students from Goethe-Institut’s language courses as well as from CPB Prism who were already under their mentorship in late 2021. The students used iPhones provided by CPB. “Every weekend, we planned photowalks with them in small groups. We curated these photowalks, because we wanted to look at different aspects of the city. And, we wanted the kids to have fun — we didn’t want it to become another assignment.” They also worked with NGOs like NalandaWay and Shishu Shakthi.  The selected group of 40 young photographers are a delightfully diverse mix from across the State. All of them have varying interests too, says Gayatri. For instance, some are interested in just going out and meeting new people; others in architecture. Over time, Gayatri says that their curriculum has evolved. “Now, it is a 12-week curriculum. It’s extensive and covers simple things like photo vocabulary, line, shapes, colours and contrast. Then it builds on to composition and the rule of thirds. The focus is always on the power of looking at things — when you look at something, how do you see and frame it?” For them, a single image is not as important as telling a story or even having a language of images, concludes Gayatri.  Be it a lone cow in the company of a stork against the backdrop of a TNEB transformer, or a cross section of Fort St George, these 120 frames point to one narrative: that of a land, its people, culture and legacy.  A Land of Stories will be on view at Government Museum, Egmore from 9.30 am to 5 pm till April 17.",Gowri S,https://www.thehindu.com/society/student-photographers-capture-tamil-nadu-and-its-stories-on-smartphones/article65143872.ece
1098,"February 28, 2022",16:32 IST,entertainment,art,Travel through Mysore with Lakshmi Krishnan’s paintings," Mysuru has brought together its residents in more ways than one. Talk to anyone from the city and they will tell you how it is a silent rule to go to Chamundi Betta (Chamundi Hill) to celebrate birthdays. Likewise, it is a very Mysuru thing to bond over the smallest of things in and around the city. Dr Lakshmi Krishnan, an oral pathologist with a keen interest in cancer research and public health, currently working as a Senior Clinical Research Scientist at Niramai Health Analytix, Bengaluru, has given the city’s residents something new to bond over. Born in Mysuru and having lived in the city for many years, Lakshmi’s fondness for her hometown never diminished even after she moved to Bengaluru. To give form to this fondness, she started a project, ‘Mysore Days with Kruthi’.  In a candid phone conversation with The Hindu, Lakshmi, 37, said she wanted to raise a toast to the city she was born, by etching 37 of her Mysuru memories in water colours.  “I was not a professional painter, although I used to dabble with art now and then,” she says with a laugh. “Having stayed in Mysuru for such a long time, it took a while to get used to the fact that I don’t stay there anymore. But my love for the city never lessened. I felt the need to do something for the city that I love deeply.” Each of the paintings of the city’s relatable and famous landmarks, are accompanied by anecdotes, thus invoking similar feelings of nostalgia among Mysuru’s current and former residents. “I did not think my paintings would receive this kind of attention on social media. It turns out that many people feel the same.”  Starting with Mysuru Banthu (Mysuru is here), Lakshmi’s very first painting is of the Varuna Canal near the city. “For most non-resident Mysurians, Varuna Canal is of the first views of ‘home’ after many days.”  “A decade ago, when I first moved out for my post-graduation, this was a sight I longed to see on most Saturday afternoons. It was a sign that home was now not far away. This, I felt, was the perfect start for my project.” She has also painted Chikka Gadiyara, Chamundi Betta, Rajkamal Theatre, Devaraja Market, Mylari Dose, and a Churmuri Gaadi ( Churmuri is a preparation of puffed rice seasoned with onions, spices, pepper, which sold on customised carts across the city) among others. “ Churmuri always remained my true love. I have painted the famous Ballal Circle churmuri gaadi, and it is representative of what I feel for churmuri and the city,” she says.

1100,"February 26, 2022",21:52 IST,entertainment,art,Jamming with art," Creating art can be a therapeutic way to destress. When done in groups, it can bring out unexpected synergies and fresh ideas. The art jamming session hosted by the newly-opened Dys Art Gallery saw senior artists, amateurs, art students, crafters and children spend two days creating an amalgamation of art works.  The concept of social art jamming has been on the rise worldwide. “This form of creativity has many advantages. When you have established artists, students and amateurs sit together and make art, the interaction and exchange of ideas give rise to a new artistic perspectives,” says Gladdys Rathi, owner of the art gallery, adding that their objective is to build a creative community. “We plan to make it a regular feature and host monthly jamming sessions,” he adds.  The first day saw senior artists and Fine Arts faculty like Sistla Srinivas and Ravi Kattakuri offering tips to the participants. On the second day, school students and crafters participated and created art works in diverse mediums. All the participants were given Hahnemuehle paper of different grammage and textures.  D Phaneesha, a sculpture student of Andhra University's department of Fine Arts, opted to create a high relief work with plasticine. Pilla Reethi chose to experiment with lamp soot on paper, creating a hazy texture. Another participant worked with bright phosphorescent colours.  For Bharati Nayudu, who came from Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, the experience was encouraging. Bharati is a crafter who works with distress inks and pigment inks on paper, using techniques like ink blending, stenciling and stamping. ""Sitting together with established artists who were appreciative of my work was a huge motivation for me as a crafter. While I learnt many ways to experiment with colours and different mediums by simply watching them work, the art students were equally excited about my stamping tools and the type of inks I used,"" says Bharati. Her 14-year-old son Ishaan Nayudu learnt the nuances of making an abstract art with acrylic paints by Anita Rao, an artist and student of Fine Arts. ""I was inspired by the works on display at the gallery and wanted to create one by blending colours. I learnt about the composition techniques and how the colours can't be scattered in random ways. The final work should be able to create interest in the viewers. It was a deeply enriching experience for me to simply observe how others used different types of techniques and brushes to make art,"" says Ishaan, who enjoys cardmaking and calligraphy.  Anita's work with charcoal on paper was a reflection of the wrinkled face of a sadhu of Varanasi. The work captured the essence of Varanasi with a temple in the background and the quintessential rudraksh beads. ""While working with charcoal, the surface of the paper should have roughness to allow the art material to adhere to the protruding part. So, instead of a flat filling of colour, there is an intermingling of the colours in the subject's eyes,"" says Anita, explaining her process. According to Bharati, one of the best parts of the experience was to see a six-year-old girl take back a little canvas with stamp work of a lama that she created during the second day’s session and complete it with a splash of colours at home. “It was heartening to see how she painted a scenery with different elements and transformed the canvas into something else,” she says. “This is what art jams do; they inspire you in such wonderful ways.”  Located in Siripuram, the art gallery has a separate section where works of Ravi Kattamuri are on display till March 6. ",Nivedita Ganguly D 6074,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/an-art-jamming-session-in-visakhapatnam-brings-out-a-plethora-of-creativity/article65083650.ece
1101,"February 25, 2022",20:30 IST,entertainment,art,Raza," It’s funny that I’ve never met the man I’m obsessed with. The only time I saw SH Raza was for a couple of minutes in 2015, a year before he died, at the India Art Fair, when he dropped by to see our curation of Krishen Khanna’s work. He came in, I took a photo, and he left. It was like an ‘if I had run into a celebrity’ moment. I believe we cannot forget Raza because his contribution to modern Indian art is being fully understood only now. He had a 73-year-long career, from 1943 (when he officially started to call himself an artist working in Bombay) to 2016. And in that time, among the many things he’s taught us, are two important points.  First, his secularism. He came to Bombay a year after the Quit India movement launched in the city. Raza saw both the protest and the result, which is very rare. (We often have to wait decades to see the result of our protests.) Raza was involved with all the key players — with Mulk Raj Anand and the progressive writers, and Ebrahim Alkazi and the progressive theatre group. He was at the forefront of artistic protest. But through it all, he maintained his secular outlook. He is the ultimate example of what India can do.  Second, his global aesthetic. Art in India — other than indigenous forms like miniatures, Tanjore paintings, kalamkari, etc — is western academic art. The idea of the canvas, oil paints, exhibitions, galleries, everything is western. In that context, Raza realised he was learning modern art second hand, and he wanted to go to the primary source. So he went to Paris and in 1956, won the Prix de la Critique — a critics’ award, which is a high honour, much like the BAFTAs (and not the Oscars). He was the first non-French person to get it.  Raza constantly pursued a global understanding of modern art. He opened a gateway and created a continuous dialogue between people in India and Europe. This is a lesson young artists today should learn. You may paint something that resonated with you in your village, but how will I explain it to a collector in Mumbai, Iran or London? You should learn to expand your ability to communicate beyond your own little bubble. That’s why a Picasso resonates with the world. Or a Raza. They speak a global language. You don’t need to explain circles and squares and tantra and bindu.  In the Louvre in Abu Dhabi, there is a Mark Rothko hanging immediately next to a Raza. It says that here are two artists who dealt with very similar concepts, and anybody in the world can understand them.  Passion project Finding a calendar for Swedish company Volkart Brothers, from 1947 — with each month featuring a painting by Raza — triggered a large research journey for me. I realised that much of the years he stayed in Bombay, he was employed as a commercial artist. Many don’t know this. So I began looking into his Bombay years, and it is turning out to be a full book (which I have been writing for two years now and I hope to complete in another three months). I am telling a story; an almost day-by-day recall of what he did between 1943 and 1950. And all of it is new research.  I have literally gone through seven years of newspapers at the Maharashtra State Archive, reading every ‘Today’s Engagement’ starting January 1, 1943. If it mentioned Raza’s name somewhere, like an exhibition of his work at the Bombay Art Society (which he would have attended in person because he was living in the city), then I would look at what else he would have discovered the event. This is how I know that he saw an exhibition that MoMA had sent down in 1947 of Picasso’s work. In 1949, Raza painted a work that was very similar to one of Picasso’s pieces exhibited then. It’s been such Sherlock Holmes moments. As told to Surya Praphulla Kumar Ashvin Rajagopalan is director of Piramal Art Foundation, Mumbai, and Ashvita’s, Chennai. A new exhibition curated by him at the Piramal Museum of Art showcases over 40 works (1944 to 2005) that trace Raza’s artistic development — from his formative years in Bombay to when he became world renowned.",Ashvin Rajagopalan,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/raza-was-secular-with-a-global-outlook/article65084830.ece
1102,"February 25, 2022",19:51 IST,entertainment,art,As red as freedom," When I met Smriti Dixit last year, she told me with a conspiratorial smile, “I am working on a show and it’s going to be quite different.” How different, I wondered, as Dixit, 50, always works with difficult and unexpected mediums that bring diverse meanings to her installations. I still remember her blood red Hibiscus River at the Goa Serendipity Arts Festival in 2018, in the section curated by Ranjit Hoskote. One’s senses were ‘overcome’ by the primeval, magnified bloodshot globules descending from the ceiling — referencing the female menstrual cycle. Her latest solo at Art Musings, titled Savage Flowers, presents sculptures woven from cloth and plastic price tags — everyday found, made, recycled and upcycled materials, encoded with her interpretations. “I titled the exhibition ‘ Savage Flowers’ to honour the untameable spirit of Smriti’s work,” says curator Nancy Adajania. “She had told me, with twinkling eyes, ‘Nancy, if a certain janglipan [wildness] doesn’t show in my work, I feel uncomfortable!’ And the wildness here is that unfettered and transgressive energy of women who defy domestication — who, metaphorically, run with wolves. That is what this exhibition pulsates with.” A 2019 news article about women’s uteruses being removed without their knowledge or consent so they did not have to take maternity leave (in Beed, Maharashtra) inspired Dixit to start the project. The 2018 Sabarimala case, where women of menstruating age protested the ban to enter the temple and a court lifted it, was another starting point. “It is the patriarchal system that wants to control women and shame them for their strongest factor,” says Dixit. At the gallery, her works sprawl on the floor, hang from the ceiling, and climb up walls. The Garden of Guilt and Pleasure is an ensemble of wall hangings densely woven out of plastic tags — divesting its commercial function, the tags become mulch, creepers and dirt-covered root vegetables. Another piece, Declaration, is a textile sculpture of the uterus, made with vermilion red cotton and nylon. “What draws me to Smriti’s work is its unruly, shapeshifting character,” says Adajania. “I wanted the exhibition scenography to reflect a sense of continuous growth and proliferation, which is a distinctive feature of her sculpture installations.” Hand work plays a key role in Savage Flowers. Dixit, who has used both knitting and weaving techniques in the project, worked with women from her neighbourhood in Kandivali. “It captures their body rhythm and unique energy, and it breaks the monotony of machine-made products,” says the artist.  This was another facet Adajania wanted to highlight. “I wanted viewers to experience the differential flows of time with which Smriti invests her work. She works for months together, repetitively and obsessively, to make a single work. It is her way of acknowledging undervalued domestic labour, and it is also a form of japa [chant] meant to invoke the generative energies of the universe. So the exhibition is conceived as a set of environments that the viewer can immerse herself in, environments in which to lurk, explore and linger,” she concludes. Savage Flowers  is on till March 10, at Art Musings, Mumbai.",Georgina Maddox,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/smriti-dixits-savage-flowers-as-red-as-freedom/article65083332.ece
1103,"February 25, 2022",16:46 IST,entertainment,art,5 works of SH Raza everyone should know," SH Raza’s career witnessed several phases of artistic progression. “This versatility,” says Sneha Gautam, VP of AstaGuru Auction House, “makes it an exciting process to curate his works. We try our best to source important pieces that encompass and represent the epoch of his various phases.” Here are five important works to celebrate his legacy. Untitled (Street Scene), 1947: Raza started his career with idyllic landscapes deftly executed in water colour and depicting the Indian mainland. This was a formative phase of the artist’s career and this untitled work was executed in the same year he co-founded the Progressive Artists’ Group. Paysage Corse, 1958: This work comes from the decade when Raza began the process of diluting tangible structure in his art. Post 1958, his works rarely involved the etching of a structure with architectural lineage.  La Provence Noire, 1965: Raza’s expressionist creation sprawls with black. The artwork has thick strokes of black while the suggested iridescent illumination is troughed with a sporadic application of white paint. The artist created this work just before he commenced the search for the source of Bindu.  La Terre, 1980: This work comes from the ‘La Terre’ series, which is symbolic of Raza’s long engagement with nature. It signifies the evolution of his vocabulary and is from a key transitional phase.  Sanshari, 1994: This work comes from the ‘Bindu’ series, for which he is most famous. “Bindu is a source of energy, a source of life. Life begins here, attains infinity here,” said the artist, about the iconic symbol that dominated his oeuvre for the last three decades of his life.

1104,"February 25, 2022",14:47 IST,entertainment,art,Vinod Daroz explores ideas of oneness through ceramic art," Aikyam, or oneness, is ceramist Vinod Daroz’s labour of love for nearly four years. The exhibition on display at Hyderabad’s Kalakriti Art Gallery showcases a wide range of his ceramic sculptures; a few standalone three-dimensional sculptures aside, several smaller works come together to form wall-mounted installations of varied kinds, each narrating a story. His work is a blend of Indian and oriental aesthetics. He uses motifs of South Indian temples as metaphors to discuss gender issues.  Mortar and pestle, Shiva lingam, abhisheka kalasam, designs on temple murals, gopurams and the inner sanctum find representation in Vinod Daroz’s work: “In the last 15 years, I have frequently visited temples in Kanchipuram, Srisailam and other cities; I take back new observations each time.”  On occasions, Daroz is lucky to take photographs as reference points. Many a time, photography is prohibited and he relies on his “photographic memory”. Pointing to a series of lattice-like patterns, he traces it back to a temple in Srisailam where he spotted a similar pattern. “I could not take photographs, but what I observed there stayed with me.” The idea of the masculine and the feminine co-existing is the theme of Aikyam. The recurring mortar and pestle motifs underline this co-existence of genders; the artist also uses motifs such as egg, pupa, butterfly, buds and blooms to represent procreation and metamorphosis. There is also the underlying thematic convergence of Shiva and Shakti to denote oneness.  The forms are mounted on backgrounds as varied as small cushion-shaped sculptures to butterfly patterns, indicating both fragility and strength. One of the installations has 75 artworks mounted on individual butterfly-shaped backgrounds. “I wanted to display 100 in all, but given the space, chose 75,” says Vinod Daroz. The visual language is never monotonous. The forms are varied and so are the colours. Daroz’s work is distinct for its use of striking colours, often accentuated with golden-hued smaller elements that work as embellishments.  Born and raised in a goldsmith family in Kalwakurthy near Hyderabad, Vinod Daroz lives and works in Vadodara. The work that has emerged from his studio in Vadodara has helped him forge collaborations with ceramic artists and galleries in China, Macau and Thailand, among other nations. “Neither me nor my wife use gold for its ornamental value, but I use 24 karat gold in some of my artworks. It is expensive and a risk when I use it for firing and it doesn’t turn out the way I want it to,” says Vinod Daroz. He works with a gas and electric kiln and makes his own colour glazes. “There are readymade glazes available nowadays but I make my own colours so that I can work with a wider colour palette.” Areas surrounding Rajkot, Vadodara and other towns in Gujarat, he explains, are hotspots for mining and hardware industries, which makes it easier to get chemicals to prepare glazes. The colours he has used for Aikyam include turquoise, mint greens, multiple shades of blue, lemon yellows, pastel pinks and browns. Some of the artworks use a blend of colours: “A lot depends on the firing process. A reduction firing yields a different colour from an oxidation firing.” Curatorial advisor Lina Vincent aptly describes such ceramic art as a coming together of the earth (clay), fire, water and air. The oriental play of blue and white has also found its way into his work, thanks to his frequent visits to China prior to the pandemic. He recalls his visit to Jingdezhen, the porcelain city of China where several European artists established their studios: “It is a huge resource for any ceramic artist. You get help from model and mould makers, slip casters… you name it.” Having already exhibited in China and Macau, Vinod Daroz hopes to revisit the countries post-pandemic. Another installation uses ornate photographic frames mounted with artworks, as though intended to be a memory for the ages. Art, explains the artist, is a personal expression but thankfully there are art collectors who recognise ceramics beyond its utilitarian value: “Some of the artworks are time-consuming. Despite working on Aikyam for more than three years, I was not satisfied. Until the day I packed to leave for Hyderabad, I was working in the studio.” (Aikyam is on view at Kalakriti art gallery, Hyderabad, till March 27)",Sangeetha Devi Dundoo,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/vinod-daroz-explores-ideas-of-oneness-through-ceramic-art/article65080355.ece
1105,"February 24, 2022",18:47 IST,entertainment,art,Artist from Tamil Nadu captures his hometown in landscape paintings," Every morning, before the golden hour strikes, Puviyarasu Kannadasan sets out on his trusty bike with his companions: a canvas, an easel, a black pen and some paints. When he sees a sight that tugs at him, he stops, props up the easel and begins his work.  Wielding a black pen, he traces what is before him: be it an empty, quiet pastoral field, or a temple ground that spills chaotic energy. Bits and pieces of the town he grew up in — Arani in Tiruvallur — thus sprawls across Puviayarsu’s canvases, largely black-and-white. At his first-ever solo show titled Petrichor, in DakshinaChitra Museum, 28 such creations (both sketches and paintings) are on display.  Puviyarasu vividly recalls his first brush with art: as an eight-year-old child, he would accompany relatives as they went around town making signage and banners. The little boy would wait on the artists, clean their brushes and run errands. When banner art was digitised, this came to a standstill.  “But I wanted to take this interest forward, by somehow enrolling in the College of Fine Arts, Chennai. I didn’t even know about the college till then,” he recalls. Under the tutelage of artist Illaiyaraja, he cracked the entrance — “that was the biggest achievement for me.” When he found himself in the visual communication department, he was disappointed because he wished to specialise in painting . It was with the guidance of his seniors that he later came to know of his knack for recreating landscapes.  
“After that, till my fourth year at the college, I kept painting landscapes,” says Puviyarasu. However, after his college days in 2007, he broke away to dabble in cinema: as an assistant cameraman. “It didn’t last long. Next stop was animation which was also short-lived. I wasn’t satisfied.” Until he started painting again. “I felt like whatever I wanted to honestly express was in my work all along. But leaving something so dear to me, I went in search of other occupations,” he recalls.  
Getting back to what he loved most, was a life-changing step for the artist. Speaking of his choice of medium and material, the artist says, “Monotone always creates a greater impact. Moreover, a pen is easier to wield, I feel like I am able to express myself freely with a pen. A passing strike of a pen on paper is similar to a strike on my creative mind.” Apart from this, a determining factor for his work is the time : “Light plays a major role in my landscapes.” I usually set out at 6.30 am. My work practically stops at 11 am. In the afternoon, 2.30 pm to 5.30 pm is a good window.” It’s not often that he manages to finish a work in a day. He continues, “Sometimes, it takes me a week to capture the ‘feel’ of the sight. So I keep going back.” Now, while he works as an art teacher in a nearby school, he makes sure to continue his personal practice. “I am so happy that I am able to live as an artist among those who I grew up around. Each day, when I go around town, I am learning more and more about life. I see new colours,” says Puviyarasu.

1107,"February 24, 2022",15:06 IST,entertainment,art,Babitha Rajiv’s painting exhibition is a take on,"  Babitha Rajiv wants the viewers to interpret her paintings. Even if the interpretations are far removed from what Rajiv has tried to convey, she has no complaints. “Once I finish a work, I don’t have an authority over it and it ceases to be my idea,” says Babitha Rajiv. The Kochi-based artist’s exhibition, ‘The Quest for Blue Flower’, is currently on at Vyloppilly Samskrithi Bhavan in Thiruvananthapuram. This is her fifth solo exhibition and it showcases 37 paintings in different media. There are works in acrylics, pen, pencil and charcoal. “All of us have desires, some gets fulfilled. But, most of us would have unfulfilled desires too, which we keep trying to attain, knowing fully well that they would never materialise. Yet, we keep aspiring for it. The path we choose or the efforts we take to get there and the disappointment over not attaining them have been conveyed through these paintings. The colour blue stands for human desire,” explains the artist.  Babitha Rajiv adds that for a couple of paintings, she has kept the theme gender neutral. As in her previous exhibitions, Rajiv says that she did some research before working on the theme. “I asked a few of my friends and family members about their desires. I heard things like ‘I want to be the Indian President!’ Then there is this friend who loves someone she can’t ever be with. Another person told me that her desire is to sleep peacefully at least for a day. I am the secret-keeper of my friends and family because they trust me. A few of those secret wishes have inspired some of these paintings,” she says. She has also put in a few of her desires. “I won’t reveal that!” Babitha Rajiv laughs. The frames also touch upon the mind, its complexities and vulnerabilities. For example, in one of the untitled works in charcoal and acrylic, two interwined forms, looking like skeletons, are shown extracting each others’ hearts in such a way that it breaks all romantic notions about love. “I know it is a wild take on that feeling. But that is what happens in love, right? Once you start a relationship, possessiveness seeps in,” Babitha Rajiv explains. Another work, a set of three in acrylic, ruminates upon the universal phenomenon that ‘The grass is always greener on the other side’. She has featured zebras in these paintings, which she says are one of her favourite animals. “In my last exhibition, ‘613 seeds’, zebras were an important component. This set is the first work I did after that exhibition and zebras came in as a continuation of that event,” she says.  The exhibition has three-set, six-set and eight-set paintings as well. “Story art, as it is called, is a format that I love to do. It is extremely challenging because you have to ensure the continuity,” Rajiv adds.  Babitha Rajiv has been in the art field for a decade now. A “self-taught artist”, she has been hooked to painting from her childhood. “There was always that drive and resolve to follow my passion, a quality that got ingrained in me because I am a sportsperson. I quit my job as a radiographer as well. I used to draw so much but none of them conveyed the idea in a direct way. My husband noticed that aspect and took my works to an artist who, in turn, referred me to another artist.” Eventually, for the first time, she exhibited her paintings at Eka The Art Gallery in Fort Kochi.  The painting exhibition, organised by Kerala Lalithakala Akademi, is on till March 1.

1108,"February 24, 2022",11:59 IST,entertainment,art,"Remembering Raza — in Mumbai, Paris and Gorbio"," As the Indian art fraternity celebrates Sayed Haider Raza’s centenary (he was born on February 22, 1922), I recall the first-ever major retrospective show of his that I did. It was in 2002, at the Jehangir Art Gallery, and it surprised many collectors, who least expected a South Indian gallery to be the first one to do something of this magnitude.  The truth was, up until then there had been little interest in him. After meeting Raza in 1985 at Jehangir gallery, at the only major show of modernist painter Bal Chhabda (presented by members of the Progressive Artists’ Group, or PAG, which Raza co-founded in 1947), I built an interest in him while his other gallery friends forsook him (the second generation who took over the galleries were looking at the works of younger artists).  While we were working on the 2002 show — to celebrate his eightieth birthday — what a treasure he let me see. I climbed up a ladder in his home, dived into his loft, and fished out all kinds of things. There were drawings and sketches and paintings, right from his early days. I found a board that had Raza’s work painted over Akbar Padamsee’s. It was a painting similar to Raza’s paperworks of the same period, with a Padamsee signature in front and Raza’s at the back! They all shared studios, and if you look at the works of Raza, Padamsee and FN Souza from the 50s (members of PAG), they were much like each other. They were friends, their lives entwined along with influences of Paris and its environs. Ours was an eventful couple of decades of friendship, with many trips to visit him and his lovely wife, Janine Mongillat, in France. They refused to let me stay with my friends in Paris; it was always at their Rue de Charonne apartment, where the guest room was in Janine’s studio. It was in a repurposed old convent, where they had one very large floor that housed the couple’s home and studio, which they shared with their cat, Bonnard. Raza’s journey that began with his birth in Mandla, a tribal village in Madhya Pradesh, led to a scholarship at the École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris where he met his artist wife. To the dismay of her parents, she married the Indian artist and son of a forest ranger — who had stayed back to read philosophy and study the work of post-impressionist painter Cézanne on the advice of photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson — and remained his strongest supporter up until 2002, when he lost her to cancer.  Janine put aside her art career (showing very occasionally) to assist and support Raza on his journey. As I became familiar with her body of work over the many visits as a house guest in her studio bedroom, I realised how strong her work was and recognised the sacrifice she had made for her husband’s career.  Raza was the master at home who dominated the conversation, but as we two women bonded, she and I would go shopping and chat about all the things in India that he hadn’t shared with her. It was Janine who introduced me to Paris, my favourite city, and the streets that I am so familiar with now.  This artist couple in the 90s, when hardly anyone from the Indian art world visited them, gave me the most lovely memories in both Paris and Gorbio in southern France where they had a summer home. Their studio there, in a lovely little cottage in the mountains (which still stands today), had a view of the Côte d’Azur.  My favourite Gorbio story is when, on one of my summer trips, I asked Raza about an unusual painting that hung high above the door in the studio. It was green and orange, a departure from his paintings of bold primary geometrics. As I looked at it puzzled, he said it was the orange moon. Having never seen one, I told myself it was his mind’s image. That night we were walking across the village to its only restaurant for dinner, and lo and behold in the sky I sight this big ball of orange. I exclaimed, to which Raza politely said, “See, I told you.” Something in the Mediterranean air gave it the colour, which was perhaps one of the reasons why this element, mixed with imagery from tantric art, became Raza’s le motif after the 80s. Having made his home in Paris, he realised he had to stand apart and bring something strong to his art. Conversations with painter-sculptor Velu Viswanathan and his exposure to Ajit Mookerjee’s writings on tantric art allowed him to translate these ideas and combine them with his abstracts. The dark sun in his abstract landscapes of the 70s became the ‘Bindu’ in his works from the 90s — a part of his exploration of nature that he made his very own and is now known to all of us. The repeated motives he used, he told me, was like a japam (chant), which was refined each time and slowly evolved.  Raza would have turned a hundred this week (he died in 2016), and his idea of the beej (seed) and the empty void of the womb — the circle of life and death — still continues. The cycle is the circle, the bindu, the beginning and the end, and what he bestowed on the Indian art world.

1109,"February 22, 2022",15:57 IST,entertainment,art,"Pizza, with a side of art"," Tucked away in a little lane off Sarjapur Road in Bengaluru, is ‘Eating Love,’ a pizzeria founded in 2018 by Jaydev Vyas and Niharika Peri. While it may be one in a handful of purely vegetarian pizza places in the city, what makes it unique are its pizza boxes — they feature the work of budding artists. Niharika, who worked in an art gallery in Chennai for a few years before joining an art magazine, felt she could carve a similar niche for herself when she had to relocate to Bengaluru. However, when things did not pan out, she turned to her passion for baking. “I am quite fond of bread and during any of my jaunts in Europe, I would try out the different breads available there. I had always wanted to learn how to bake and since I had decided to give this a try, I took classes from Antonio Scirocco, an Italian chef based in Puducherry. He also guided me on the best brick ovens and even built one for us.“ “I wanted to create something wholesome and decided at the onset that ‘Eating Love’ would be good for the tastebuds as well as the stomach. That is how we included whole wheat bases as well as gluten-free, vegan, Jain and eggless options in our menu.”  “As a vegetarian, I have often faced a dearth of options. Once I had decided on ‘Eating Love,’ I began connecting with people in the city to source cheeses, vegetables, olive oil and herbs. Today, our pizzas feature greens such as kale, watercress, arugula and fresh oregano with a combination of cheeses such as stracciatella, smoked scarmoza and chevre.” After another stint in Puducherry to learn the nuances of making sourdough pizza, Niharika launched ‘Eating Love’. Just as they were settling in, COVID-19 hit. “Suddenly there was a lack of conversation, that personal touch with customers was lost. Orders from delivery platforms were no match for personal interaction,” she says.
While powwowing with Latheesh Lakshman, a friend of hers, the duo came up with an idea to create pizza boxes which could be conversation starters. Latheesh, a design director in the advertising industry for close to 13 years, met Niharika when she was working with the art magazine. “There is a fine difference between art and design; it lies in how you conceive an idea and explain or display it irrespective of the medium,” he says, adding, “My taste in art has always centred around design — it might not necessarily qualify as fine art.” According to Kochi-based Latheesh, an image appearing on a box needs to blend art and design. And the works of the three artists Niharika and he zeroed in on reflect a fine graphic form and layout sense. “When COVID-19 hit, there was no chance for people to go to galleries; this was one way art could reach them. While we decided to showcase interesting and unusual artists, the ones we chose had not exhibited their work in the mainstream art world and this was a good chance to showcase their work.”  He says the work of Mumbai-based artist Kanika Agarwal who works with collages perfectly mirrored how a pizza is made. “It comprises bits and pieces of different ingredients and I found the parallel interesting.” Reshidev R K who hails from Kerala, is currently based in the United States and has a background in design and illustration. “His works display a sense of balance and are well laid out. I was trying to identify that kind of artistic sense. Besides, it looks well on a box,” says Latheesh. The third artist was Jyothi Venugopal from Bengaluru. “I have seen her work on social media and used to marvel at how unique her style was. I was scouting for the right opportunity to showcase her style and it came with Eating Love,” he says.  “I wanted to draw attention for them because an artist needs an audience and when there are no galleries, no conversations evolve and it gets quite depressing,” says Niharika. Apart from these images appearing on the pizza boxes, the originals are on display at ‘Eating Love’ and are available for purchase.  According to Niharika, in the event a painting is sold, the boxes with that work of art printed on it will continue in the delivery of pizzas till stocks last. “We will feature three other artists the next time we are placing an order for boxes. The idea is to build a gallery on our website, irrespective of whether the art gets sold,” she says.

1110,"February 19, 2022",16:09 IST,entertainment,art,An artist’s initiative to connect Bengal to Baroda," When Surajit Biswas graduated from Visva-Bharati in 2014, earning a master’s degree in painting, he knew he was going to Baroda. Several of his seniors at the university had moved there and even he, while paying a visit to them, had discovered for himself that the city was more conducive to struggling artists like him.  “There are frequent camps and exhibitions, and there are ample studio spaces — the culture in Baroda is generally favourable for artists, especially those who have just graduated and are looking for platforms to hone their skills,” Mr. Biswas, 40, told The Hindu.  After about five years in that city, where he continues to be based, the artist decided to create a bit of Baroda in Santiniketan for the benefit of art students in Bengal. He started a project called Hidden Artist Initiative, under which he rented a house in a village, Boner Pukur Danga, and set up Bhumi-Kriya, offering space and ambience — for free — to artists who lack those ingredients at home.  “I don’t think I am doing something great. I am a struggling artist myself but I am doing this out of passion. I want to give budding artists in Bengal a platform to learn and grow. Santiniketan is a great place to be but only as long as you are a student of Visva-Bharati; once you graduate there are hardly any opportunities. The Hidden Artist Initiative, in fact, can serve as a connection between Baroda and Bengal,” Mr. Biswas said.  “We started in 2019 and shortly after that COVID-19 struck, but even then, the response has been incredible. Back then, the posts on our Facebook page had not even 50 views, but now the number of views is usually more than 1,000, sometimes even a few thousand. If I had a facility like this when I graduated, I would have probably never left Bengal,” said the artist, who hails from Shyam Nagar near Kolkata.  Not just anyone can walk into Bhumi Kriya. Aspirants need to apply and there is a screening process for which Mr. Biswas engages fellow artists. Successful applicants can not only make use of the space and the calm ambience but also benefit from the guidance of senior art students and teachers from Visva-Bharati, who drop by often. “That is the advantage of being located in Santiniketan. I only have to put up posters and teachers and senior students from the university are kind enough to respond. They are in and out of the place,” he said.  Among the most recent activities hosted at Bhumi Kriya is an ‘adda session’ with Pulak Dutta, a retired professor of graphics at Visva-Bharati, and a paper-making workshop by Sanchayan Ghosh, an associate professor in the department of painting at the university. March is likely to be a busy month, with several workshops and open-studio sessions postponed due to the pandemic to be held at the time.  “The idea behind my initiative is very simple. If, instead of waiting for big opportunities to come their way, artists can come forward to share their learning and experiences with one another, something beautiful can be created out of that gesture,” Mr. Biswas said.",Bishwanath Ghosh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/an-artists-initiative-to-connect-bengal-to-baroda/article65065157.ece
1111,"February 18, 2022",16:04 IST,entertainment,art,Spivak extract," I am deeply honoured that the Sahitya Akademi have decided to acknowledge my efforts to translate the fiction of Mahasweta Devi. I want to begin by thanking Mahasweta Devi for writing such spectacular prose. I want to thank my parents, Pares Chandra Chakravorty and Sivani Chakravorty for bringing me up in a household that was acutely conscious of the riches of Bangla. My father was a doctor. But we children were always reminded that my father’s Bangla essay for his matriculation examination had been praised by Tagore himself. And my mother? I could not possibly say enough about her on this particular occasion. Married at fourteen and with children coming at ages fifteen and twenty-three, this active and devoted wife and mother, delighted every instance with the sheer fact of being alive, studied in private and received her MA in Bengali literature from Calcutta University in 1937. She reads everything I write and never complains of the obscurity of my style…. Samik Bandyopadhyay introduced me to Mahasweta Devi in 1979. Initially, I was altogether overwhelmed by her. In 1981, I found myself in the curious position of being asked to write on deconstruction and on French feminism by two famous US journals,  Critical Inquiry and  Yale French Studies respectively. I cannot now remember why that position had then seemed to me absurd. At any rate, I proposed a translation of Mahasweta’s short story ‘Draupadi’ for  Critical Inquiry, with the required essay on deconstruction plotted through a reading of the story. When I look back upon that essay now, I am struck by its innocence. I had been away from home for twenty years then. I had the courage to acknowledge that there was something predatory about the non-resident Indian’s obsession with India. Much has changed in my life since then, but that initial observation retains its truth. I should perhaps put it more tactfully today. Why did I think translating Mahasweta would free me from being an expert on France in the US? I don’t know. But this instrumentality disappeared in the doing. I discovered again, as I had when I had translated Jacques Derrida’s  De la grammatologie ten years earlier, that translation was the most intimate act of reading. Not only did Mahasweta Devi not remain Gayatri Spivak’s way of freeing herself from France, but indeed the line between French and Bengali disappeared in the intimacy of translation. The verbal text is jealous of its linguistic signature but impatient of national identity. Translation flourishes by virtue of that paradox. The line between French and Bengali disappeared for this translator in the intimacy of the act of translation. Mahasweta resonated, made a  dhvani (literally ‘resonance’), with Derrida, and vice versa. This has raised some ire, here and elsewhere. This is not the occasion for discussing unhappy things. But let me crave your indulgence for a moment and cite a couple of sentences, withholding theory, that I wrote in a letter to my editor Anjum Katyal of Seagull Books, when I submitted to her the manuscript of my translation of ‘Murti’ and ‘Mohanpurer Rupkatha’ by Mahasweta Devi: [In these two stories] the aporias between gendering on the one hand (“feudal” – transitional and subaltern) and the ideology of national liberation (as tragedy and as farce) on the other, are also worth contemplating. But I am a little burnt by the resistance to theory of the new economically restructured reader who would prefer her NRI neat, not shaken up with the ice of global politics and local experience. And so I let it rest. That hard sentence at the end reflects my hurt and chagrin at the throwaway remark about Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak’s “sermonizing” offered by the reviewer, in  India Today, of  Imaginary Maps (Routledge, 1995), the very book that you have chosen to honour. I was hurt, of course. But I was chagrined because “sermonizing” was also the word used by Andrew Steer, then deputy director for the environment at the World Bank, in 1992, when I had suggested, at the European Parliament, that the World Bank re-examine its constant self-justificatory and fetishized use of the word people.  …(M)y concern is for the constitution of the ethical subject – as life/ translator (Klein), narrow-sense/ translator, reader-as-translator (RAT). Why did I decide to gild Mahasweta’s lily? Shri Namwar Singh, professor of Hindi at Jawaharlal Nehru University, who presided over the occasion, will remember that instructors at the Department of Modern Indian Literatures at Delhi University had asked me in 1987 why, when Bangla had Bankim and Tagore, I had chosen to speak on ‘Shikar’, one of the stories included in  Imaginary Maps. …My devotion to Mahasweta did not need national public recognition. To ignore the narrative of action or text as ethical instantiation is to forget the task of translation upon which being-human is predicated. Translation is to transfer from one to the other. In Bangla, as in most North Indian languages, it is  anu-vada — speaking after,  translatio as  imitatio. This relating to the other as the source of one’s utterance is the ethical as being-for. All great literature as all specifically good action — any definition would beg the question here — celebrates this. To acknowledge this is not to “sermonize,” one hopes. Translation is thus not only necessary but unavoidable. And yet, as the text guards its secret, it is impossible. The ethical task is never quite performed. ‘Pterodactyl, Puran Sahay, and Pirtha,’ one of the tales included in  Imaginary Maps, is the story of such an unavoidable impossibility. The Indian Aboriginal is kept apart or othered by the descendants of the old settlers, the ordinary “Indian”. In the face of the radically other, the prehistoric pterodactyl, the Aboriginal and the settler are historically human together. The pterodactyl cannot be translated. But the Aboriginal and the settler Indian translate one another in silence and in the ethical relation. This founding task of translation does not disappear by fetishizing the native language. Sometimes I read and hear that the subaltern can speak in their native languages. I wish I could be as self-assured as the intellectual, literary critic and historian, who assert this in English. No speech is speech if it is not heard. It is this act of hearing-to-respond that may be called the imperative to translate. We often mistake this for helping people in trouble, or pressing people to pass good laws, even to insist on behalf of the other that the law be implemented. But the founding translation between people is a listening with care and patience, in the normality of the other, enough to notice that the other has already silently made that effort. This reveals the irreducible importance of idiom, which a standard language, however native, cannot annul. And yet, in the interest of the primary education of the poorest, looking forward to the privative norms of democracy, a certain standard language must also be shared and practised. Here we attempt to annul the impossibility of translation, to deny provisionally Saussure’s warning that historical change in language is inherited. The toughest problem here is translation from idiom to standard, an unfashionable thing among the elite progressives, without which the abstract structures of democracy cannot be comprehended. Paradoxically, here, idiomaticities must be attended to most carefully. I have recently discovered that there is no Bangla-to-Bangla dictionary for this level (the primary education of the poorest) and suitable to this task (translation from idiom to standard). The speaker of some form of standard Bengali cannot hear the self-motivated subaltern Bengali unless organized by politically correct editing, which is equivalent to succour from above. It is not possible for us to change the quality of rote learning in the lowest sectors of society. But with an easy-to-use same-language dictionary, a spirit of independence and verification in the service of rule-governed behaviour — essential ingredients for the daily maintenance of a democratic polity — can still be fostered. The United Nations, and non-governmental organizations in general, often speak triumphantly of the establishment of numbers of schools. We hardly ever hear follow-up reports, and we do not, of course, know what happens in those classrooms every day. But a dictionary, translating from idiom to standard even as it resists the necessary impossibility of translation, travels everywhere. It is only thus that subalternity may painstakingly translate itself into a hegemony that can make use of and exceed all the succour and resistance that we can organize from above. I have no doubt about this at all…. Today as we speak to accept our awards for translating well from the twenty-one languages of India, I want to say, with particular emphasis, that what the largest part of the future electorate needs, in order to accede, in the longest run to democracy, rather than have their votes bought and sold, is practical, simple same-language dictionaries that will help translate idiom into standard, in all these languages. I hope the Akademi will move toward the satisfaction of this need. For myself, I cannot help but translate what I love, yet I resist translation into English; I never teach anything whose original I cannot read and constantly modify printed translations, including my own. I think it is a bad idea to translate Gramsci and Kafka and Baudelaire into Indian languages from English. As a translator, then, I perform the contradiction, the counter-resistance, that is at the heart of love. And I thank you for rewarding what need not be rewarded, the pleasure of the text.

1112,"February 18, 2022",16:36 IST,entertainment,art,Digitization of manuscripts at ORI gains traction," The proposed digitisation of manuscripts at the Oriental Research Institute (ORI) in Mysuru has gained traction with the University of Mysore taking fresh initiatives in this regard. The varsity entered into an MoU with Mythic Society, Bengaluru on February 18. The outcome will lead to digitisation of manuscripts in which a slice of the intellectual heritage of ancient and medieval India are preserved by way of literary works and treatise on various subjects.  The ORI is a repository of about 70,000 manuscripts apart from 41,000 rare printed and other type of manuscripts. The only and fully extant volume of Kautilya’s Arthashastra was discovered at ORI in 1905 by scholar Rudrapatna Shamashastry who published it in 1909. Till then, its existence was known only by references in other ancient works. Arthashastra throws light on the polity and statecraft in ancient India.  Prof. G. Hemantha Kumar, Vice Chancellor, University of Mysore, said that the project has a time frame of two years, but the completion of digitisation could take up to 6 years. Depending on the progress, the tenure of the project can be extended, he added.  As per the MoU, the ORI palm-leaf manuscripts will be cleaned, and a regular process for cleaning and preserving them will be put in place while the catalogue of titles that include palm leaf manuscripts, hand-written works and collection of printed works, will be made available to the public.  All the palm leaf works and books will be image-scanned and preserved in a safe place while the images will be put for crowdsourced text digitisation. All important palm leaf works will be identified and their unicode digitsation will be undertaken with the help of manuscript readers. Besides, ORI will have an independent portal providing all information about the collection apart from sharing its content as well.  The urgency of digitising the texts stems from the imperatives of preserving the knowledge-base for posterity as the manuscripts are not only old, but have become so brittle and fragile that they turn into powder when opened. The 17 volumes of published catalogues will also be digitised for searchable options along with the new and yet-to-be-published volumes, as per the MoU.  There will be a detailed manpower and resource planning exercise to cover the whole operation at ORI from cleaning and treating the manuscripts to digitisation of the catalogues. As per the MoU, the Mythic Society will hire experienced professionals for the work. Besides, other staff would be recruited or trained for undertaking various tasks at the ORI. All the staff will be paid by the Mythic Society. ",The Hindu Bureau,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/digitisation-of-manuscripts-at-ori-mysuru-gains-traction/article65062149.ece
1113,"February 17, 2022",09:02 IST,entertainment,art,Man," The Owl Cat seems to be surveying the world outside the canvas. The curious being, with wings tucked in, one eye blue and the other green, has the body of an owl and the head of a cat. The charcoal and pastel pencil on paper work is one among the 27 drawings by author, cartoonist and artist Manjula Padmanabhan on show in Chennai at Art World, Sarala’s Art Centre. The exhibition, Knots & Crosses, is her first solo in India after 11 years. Manjula says she produced the bulk of the work in January this year. After two years of the pandemic, “they were just bursting to come out,” she says. All the works on show are in charcoal, a medium Manjula had not greatly experimented with before. “It really dictated the way these pieces evolved. I had not used charcoal before 2020 — I’d never known how flexible it is. From rich, dense black to very soft greys, it’s a very generous medium,” she says.  Manjula treats her canvases attentively, each frame carrying an intricate world of lines, twists and curves upon it. Many of the drawings depict knots of different kinds — knotted scarves, double knots, strange serpentine beings with human faces and hands entwined in knots, a tree with a knotty canopy. “I became interested in knots a long time ago — for very simple reasons such as tying the shoelaces in my sneakers or the ‘nada’ of my salwar. And also macramé. The idea that knots are a very integral part of our lives — from textiles and shoelaces to fishing nets — and we don’t even notice them — was of interest to me. From the moment of birth, when the umbilical cord is cut… and knotted… we learn the importance of knots.” Settled in Rhode Island in the US, Manjula says she has been drawing as a cartoonist and illustrator all along, but not as an “artist”. “In March 2020, I participated in an open-show at the DeBlois Gallery in Middletown. An open-show is when local artists are invited to submit work to a group show, at a reduced fee and with no special requirements. I submitted two pieces. It was like waking up from a long sleep, returning to my identity as an artist. I became a member at the gallery. It’s been a really happy but also hard-working time,” she says .  Manjula’s oeuvre includes novels, plays, short stories, children’s stories and her popular comic strip featuring Suki, an Indian comic character she created. The play  Harvest (1997), won her the Greek Onassis Award. Her first play, Lights Out, written in 1984 based on an eye witness account of a gang-rape, was a huge success. She is currently working on a book set in Delhi that “is not science fiction”. ‘Knots & Crosses’ is on at Sarala’s Art Centre, Chennai, till February 24.",Anasuya Menon,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/manjula-padmanabhans-charcoal-and-pastel-pencil-art-works-on-show/article65052715.ece
1114,"February 16, 2022",08:52 IST,entertainment,art,Kochi-based Swiss designer makes rug that defies stereotypical representation of women," During the early lockdown months, Vanessa Meister Varma painted close to 100 portraits of women. They were diverse — with different hairstyles, skin types, nose shapes, with and without make-up. The Kochi-based Swiss designer and creative consultant says the project was an exploration of the female identity. “I am a woman who works with visuals and I found myself thinking of ways to change the way women are portrayed in the mainstream media,” she says.  Vanessa used 16 of her portraits to design a rug for Neytt, a home furnishings brand by Cherthala-based company Extraweave. “When we think of rugs, the usual images that come to mind are geometric and abstract patterns. But I wanted mine to be figurative, to have a message, to tell a story,” Vanessa says. When she discussed the idea with the team from Neytt, they shared her enthusiasm.  The 5ft x 8 ft rug called the ‘Women Power’ rug is a brightly-coloured mosaic of women’s faces, combining 3D elements, embroidery and even jewellery. Going beyond functionality, it is perfect as a statement wall piece. The rug drew a good response when exhibited at Fiere Inde, an exhibition showcasing luxury furniture and decor brands in New Delhi in December 2021. “People were curious and asked a lot of questions. It is great to see my work start a discussion on important things,” says Vanessa. The company plans to showcase it at the India Design ID showcase in New Delhi in May.  It all began with her son’s storybook, says Vanessa. She was struck by an image of a family in the book. The mother was depicted in a salwar kameez with long hair. “I realised that I didn’t look anything like that. I have short hair and in fact, I looked more like the father in the picture.” She started examining the way women were represented in the public domain.  Vanessa’s women go beyond traditional concepts of beauty. They don’t conform to stereotypical gender norms. One of them even sports a moustache, may be a graphic representation of a financially independent woman, or at least one that does as she pleases, says Vanessa.  Some of them are close family members, some are public figures or women she has seen, some others are women she doesn’t know but would like to know better. “I was constantly asking myself questions about these women, their experiences, their personalities. I was thinking of my own experiences in the process,” says Vanessa. “I wanted to represent a broader spectrum of women.” As an extension of the project, Vanessa made a set of playing cards with these images. While one side of the card features the women’s faces, the other side contains a word. “There are no set rules of playing. You could make up your own game,” she says. Going beyond the obvious love, money and work, Vanessa includes a more complex repertoire with words such as body, pleasure, death, freedom, gender, skill, community, independence and divorce to pick out a few. Even a few Kerala-specific ones like ‘thoran’ and ‘nighty’. “These cards could spark a serious self-exploration or be used for a fun game with friends,” she says. The pack of 91 cards can be purchased on her Instagram handle.  Vanessa has started work on another rug, in black and white, also for Neytt. Her portraits of women, she says, have just begun. ",Anasuya Menon,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/kochi-based-swiss-designer-makes-rug-that-defies-stereotypical-representation-of-women/article65000182.ece

Her idea of home is fragmented, transient and a recurring theme in her art. Her new series titled Between Brackets, showcased by Shrine Empire art gallery, New Delhi, on Art in Touch (artintouch.in), extends her artistic discussion on cities and dwellings. Shruti explains that the series, while referring to how brackets hold together architectural structures, is also a metaphor for her love for language: “What is said between brackets or parentheses adds value to a sentence. Similarly, I like my art to have subtexts.” Between Brackets also draws from two of her earlier series — Spatial Dialogues and Continuity of Construction, in its focus on spaces and heritage of a city. For Spatial Dialogues (2021), she had collaborated with conservation architect Ravindra Gundu Rao whom she had known since her student days at the National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad. Rao was involved in the conservation of Maheshwar’s Ahilya Fort, which is now a heritage hotel.  When Shruti was working on her graduation project in 2003, she had stayed at Ahilya. There, she observed the heritage architecture of Maheshwar and the weavers of Sally Holkar’s Rehwa Society working on their looms on the banks of Narmada. The flight of stairs from the river to the fort, for instance, was the subject of one of her recent artworks. Shruti is also a trained textile designer and fascinated by the warp and weft; she included sketches of the looms. In her new series, she sketches brackets, at times in abstraction, to underline how they are integral to architectural forms. Her choice of media varies from wood to charcoal on paper to charcoal on mount board. She reminisces, “I would constantly hear the sound of the staff working on wood at Poshak Wada (the central courtyard of Ahilya fort).” The sketches that make up Between Brackets is an ode to the fort’s conservation and her way of reiterating the importance of conserving heritage structures in different cities.  Talking about her recurring themes of spaces, cities and home, she says, “I am constantly longing for a place where I feel that I belong. My memory of a place I can call home is fragmented — I remember the verandah of one home, a window view of another, a courtyard of another… For any thematic work, I begin with drawings and sketches and then build it up. I have found myself moving between textile and paper as media.”  Paper as a medium, she points out, works for its tactile quality as well as being portable as she moves between cities and homes, with her studio. Shruti lived in Hyderabad in the mid-2000s before work took her to other cities and she returned in 2017.

Looking around, there are quite a number of similar boards. Then there are some painted bottles hanging from some of the trees, carrying a variety of messages. There are swings, seating arrangements and several curious items made of not just tyres and bottles, but a variety of articles, what anyone would call waste. But for Midhun Viswanath and his team of friends under Chintha Arts and Craft, they are all resources for the unique installation on the beach put up under the aegis of the Kozhikode Municipal Corporation and the Department of Ports. Mayor Beena Philip will inaugurate the installation on Monday. At a single glance, they are just a pile of tyres and other waste materials. But for a creative mind, they are different. “Looking from the beach towards the shore, it looks like a ship. The lighthouse made of tyres rests on top of a tortoise that seems to be moving towards the sea,” said Midhun, explaining his work. Besides the lighthouse, an anchor made of tyres is also part of the installation. Midhun, a physical education teacher by profession, and hailing from Unnikulam near Balussery in Kozhikode district, had resigned his job to pursue a career and recognition in the field of art and craft. “I have represented Kozhikode district six times for making handicrafts from waste materials in the annual State-level work experience fair. Those certificates certainly came in handy while trying to convince the Corporation and other officials about my dream project,” he said. He set up the Chintha Arts and Craft collective to promote similar talents and impart training in art and craft. “We encourage people to think differently and hence the name Chintha,” he said. It took the team of six people nearly three months to complete the installation which is open for every visitor on the beach. However, he is concerned about the safety of the work after the inauguration. “This is a zero-budget project. The Corporation needs to do something to ensure that it is not destroyed,” he said.

1117,"February 11, 2022",18:38 IST,entertainment,art,Visakhapatnam artist Ravi Kattakuri’s new works are an ode to the feminine beauty and nature," Feminine energy dominates the canvases of artist Kattakuri Ravi's latest collection. Fifteen of Ravi's works are displayed at the Hawa Mahal at the three-day solo exhibition that started on Friday. “My new works reflect the beauty of the woman encompassing the body and spirit, along with perceived attributes of goodness, tenderness, devotion and patience,” says the Visakhapatnam-based artist. Known for his unique style of Madhubani art-influenced feminine faces, Ravi's latest canvases veer away from the overwhelming shades of whites seen in his earlier work.  Using acrylic on canvas, the artist has experimented with application of bold shades, infusing energy and striking contrasts. The paintings are intricately detailed explosions of colour, symbols and motifs.  The works capture the essence of Nature and countryside life. While one shows a woman with innocent eyes full of wonder, the other one portrays a feminine figure with the tigress drawing parallels between, as the artist explains, “the power of a woman with that of the fierceness of a lioness”. He adds, “There is a sense of mystery all around in Nature in all its beauty and glory. And that is what intrigues me.” After graduating from the Department of Fine Arts in Andhra University, Ravi pursued a Masters in Fine Arts from Viswa Bharati University, Shantiniketan, where he was influenced by Madhubani paintings. Born in an agricultural family in Andhra Pradesh, Ravi's childhood was spent in the sylvan surroundings, which the artist says, has left a deep impression on him. The vibrant hues of Nature, the simplicity of village life, the cheery gait of the village women with lustrous hair — all find a way into his work. He adds, “My style is a reflection of Indian culture with all its rich shades and perhaps that’s what draws the eye.” Ravi’s work has been featured in exhibitions across India, as well as Japan, Greece, Switzerland, China, Malaysia, South Korea and Bangladesh. Some of the canvases from this collection will be showcased in May at the Art Revolution Taipei, Taiwan, one among the prominent art fairs of Asia. The exhibition will be on at Hawa Mahal till February 13 from 11am till 6pm.", Nivedita Ganguly,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/artist-ravi-kattakuris-works-are-on-display-at-a-solo-exhibition-in-visakhapatnam/article38413515.ece
1118,"February 11, 2022",15:31 IST,entertainment,art,Is there a collector’s code?," We live in a post-modern, post-Duchampian world, where technology allows us to reproduce almost anything, both artistic and personal. We can recreate concepts, and change arrangements and assemblage of artwork once it’s been ‘collected’. However, when this is done without artistic permission and consent, it brings us to a very stimulating discussion in the age of the NFT: what are the ethics and when is not okay to do this? On January 15, photographer Dayanita Singh caused a flutter on Instagram when she questioned (good-naturedly) Mumbai-based interior designer Ravi Vazirani for making copies of her Box of Shedding artwork — one of only five unbound books that she made, each with 30 image cards held together in a wooden structure — and displaying it in his client’s home. Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but she wasn’t flattered. (While the display of an artwork is separate from copyright, it must not hinder the work’s integrity or compromise its intention.)  
The post on Instagram  While Vazirani did not comment when
The Hindu Weekend contacted him, he did immediately respond to Singh, taking down his post and making the required changes. “The problem is not the display; that is totally the collector’s prerogative. But to alter the artwork? To make copies of it? That’s the problem,” Singh shares. “However, in this case, I believe they actually did not realise what they were doing; they just got carried away.”
 If Raja Ravi Varma’s oleographic press (started in Ghatkopar, Bombay, by the artist in 1894 to print copies of his work for mass consumption) has taught us anything, it is that to bring fine art into the realm of popular culture is perhaps the best way to make an artist a household name. However, not all artists are comfortable lending their imagery — or, if they do it, they would like to go through their parent gallery supervising the production.  So we asked a few from the art world to weigh in:  Nishat Fatima Photographer and writer “Dayanita’s artwork allows you to change the front cover, if you own two boxes, which means she has given her audience/collectors the freedom to collaborate. But collaboration is not to change the entire concept of an artist’s work. She has created the box so that her images can be viewed one at a time. It is a collection presented as a single object. Collectors would not dream of buying an art installation and breaking it up into pieces, or duplicating and displaying it. This would hold true whether or not they understood the concept behind it. So does this [Vazirani’s project] indicate that photography is not considered serious ‘art’? I would argue that there is still a feeling of ‘less than’ that exists about photography, fuelled by the proliferation of images, amongst other factors, and that is something that needs to change.”  Roshini Vadehra Director, Vadehra Art Gallery “The display of artworks as far as possible should be done in consultation with the artist. It could sometimes be as simple as a diptych painting that is meant to be hung together. If an artist intends for a work to be installed in a certain way, it is the right and respectful thing to do. Also, the copyright of images always stays with the artist, even if they are not alive anymore. Permissions need to be taken for the reproduction of images, whether in print or for use in art memorabilia [the gallery’s shop sells products like limited edition prints, cushion covers, books and calendars]. If the artist is not around, then we ask the family or trust.”  Vikram Singh Independent photographer and founder of Art Dose “I am all for allowing folks to experiment with imagery in different formats and mediums — and the display of the artwork can be the prerogative of the collector — but the intellectual property rights of artists and copyright laws have to be respected [in India, the copyright law is valid for 50 years, after which, unless the image is copyrighted to a particular person or association, anyone is free to use the image].”  Monica Jain Curator-Director, Art Centrix Space; shealso works in interiors “While installing an assemblage or an installation at a client’s, I inform the artist and we do a conference call. In some cases, the artist has even travelled down to install the work themselves. After all, it is a signed work and not just a ‘design element’, and we have never encountered a problem since communication and consent is inherent to the process.”",Georgina Maddox,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/is-there-a-collectors-code/article38412572.ece
1119,"February 11, 2022",15:30 IST,entertainment,art,Yasala Prakash’s art explores rural Telengana with contemporary batik," Yasala Prakash is experiencing a mix of emotions. Though thrilled that his new exhibition ‘Reflections of Telangana on Batik’ has opened at Ravindra Bharathi in Hyderabad, he misses his late father, the legendary batik artist Yasala Balaiah during this special moment.   Fondly called ‘Batik Balaiah’, Yasala, who passed away in December 2020 was known for his vibrant recreations of stories on Telangana rural life in batik. “I miss the lively discussions we used to have on themes, paintings and how we could modernise the art form to take it to youngsters.
Maa naana chettu needalo memu perigaamu (My father was a huge tree under whose shade we grew),” says Prakash.
 
Yasala Prakash Explaining his fascination with batik, Prakash says, “Batik is unique in that it uses dye-resistant wax to create different patterns and designs.” Prakash’s last show was in 2018 at the ICCR Art Gallery. He began working on this current series of artworks in July 2021 with a focus on not just highlighting the rural life of Telangana but also showcasing its historic monuments. Now, around 35 works of 3x2 and 4x3 feet, presented by the State’s Department of Culture and Language, spread the buoyancy of batik in Ravindra Bharathi’s corridor.  
Batik artwork by Yasala Prakash The simplicity and beauty of village life come alive in Prakash’ works. A farmer playing the flute, a couple dancing and a woman dressed in her traditional best looking into a mirror depicts rural Telangana.  What stands out in the collection is Prakash’s series on horses. Unlike the traditional brown, red, yellow and black colours, the artist has experimented with shades of blue and white. “The theme is contemporary and is rarely tried in batik. We are used to doing sketches in village life so that comes easy for us but while experimenting with themes, we have to ensure the textures do not lose out on the batik beauty,” he says. 
By Yasala Prakash The artist, who works as an art teacher at Gurukulam Tribal Welfare School plans to explore the subject of horses in more works and eventually to hold a solo show on it. Meanwhele, he still follows his father’s mantra in life. “He used to tell us to work hard and not think of the outcome. The results might come later but perseverance and commitment to art are what matters.”  ‘Reflections of Telangana on batik is on at Ravindra Bharati till February 14. The artworks are priced from  ₹

1120,"February 12, 2022",20:55 IST,entertainment,art,America in Cartoons is a humorous history lesson," An exhibition of 101 cartoons and caricatures by Shreyas Navare titled ‘America in Cartoons: From Bill to Biden’, chronicling the journey of American politics, spanning five U.S. Presidents from 1998 to 2022, has been organized by the Indian Institute of Cartoonists in Bengaluru.  Shreyas is a New York City-based cartoonist, and co-founder and CEO, Ladderworks Publishing. In an email interview with The Hindu, Shreyas shares his experience of covering U.S. politics as a cartoonist and some of the changes he has observed over the years. With your cartoons chronicling the journey of U.S. politics, what changes have you seen in terms of politics, elections, leadership and administration? Given the long list of complex issues in the U.S., drawing editorial cartoons on American politics has given me great joy over 24 years. On the one hand, American politics has grown to become more diverse and inclusive, particularly around gender, race and LGBTQ+ rights. On the other, socio-economic changes, coupled with the rise of social media, have polarised society more than ever. Though power has alternated between the Democrats and the Republicans, both parties have worked equally hard to keep cartoonists like me busy. How long have you been cartooning?  My journey into the world of cartooning began in primary school, with me sketching the characters of
Jungle Book on the walls of our home. A few years later, I came across the cartoons of R. K. Laxman and my life changed completely. Mowgli and his friends made way for the caricatures of my family, classmates, teachers and our politicians. These filled countless sketchbooks and the margins of my school textbooks. I was thrilled when my first cartoon was published in a city supplement of a major national newspaper during high school, and the journey has continued ever since.
 Have you ever felt the political climate between 1998-2022 was too ideal for cartoons? Each of the five U.S. Presidents that I have drawn had something that made them a cartoonist’s delight. However, the one who stood out was of course, President Trump!  Have you seen any changes in terms of how your cartoons have been understood over the years? Over the past quarter of a century, I have seen the art of cartooning evolve mostly due to the march of technology. The space dedicated to cartoons in print newspapers has shrunk, but social media came in to save the day and enlarged the reach of cartoons to a global scale. The rise of social media, memes and tweets have democratised the art of political satire. I believe cartoonists have stood to benefit from these massive societal changes. Do you have any serial characters in your cartoons? I have created four different characters that appear in my editorial cartoons. The first is the Cartoonist’s Brush with emotive eyes and is depicted on the left bottom corner as part of the cartoon’s border. The second is Zero, the wise donkey, who appears on the right bottom corner with a final say on the situation. Zero portrays a range of emotion — joy, grief, anger and sarcasm. My third cartoon character is Tuktuk, the girl child, with alphabets and numbers in different languages depicted on her clothes, to underline the importance of education. Tuktuk asks everyone questions — from her mom to our Prime Minister. She reflects the spirit of our age and is the symbol of hope and change. The last character that appears in the cartoons alongside Tuktuk, is Infinity, a robot that she has created. Together, Zero, Tuktuk, and Infinity represent the march of evolution on Planet Earth, from animal to human to robot. Q: If you were to chronicle the journey of Indian politics, what is the one situation you would choose to depict? While in high school, I started drawing cartoons of the then-Prime Minister Narasimha Rao. Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Deve Gowda, and IK Gujral followed in quick succession and that period was one of the best times for cartoonists! After 1999, we moved towards stable governments and India has undergone a great transformation in the past two decades. Working as the Editorial Cartoonist for a major Indian newspaper during a significant part of this period, I got a chance to comment on all aspects of Indian life, including politics, through my cartoons. ‘America in Cartoons: From Bill to Biden’, is on display at the Indian Cartoon Gallery till February 19.",Sindhu Nagaraj,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/america-in-cartoons-is-a-humorous-history-lesson/article38406381.ece

The narrative is a woman’s struggle in a society based on gender bias and prejudice. The woman is not only an object of the male gaze and hunger but also of his complete control. Rejani’s uses jute as a medium to convey her stark strong and scathing expression. 
a work by artist Rejani S R  Made with jute and found objects- beads, rope, cords, clay and cloth- the untitled feminine forms depict a woman in the throes of childbirth, as an object of erotica, a powerful Goddess and as a lay girl. One of the most forceful works is the eye-catching figure of a woman in child birth, in the primal moment of procreation. The newborn is a heap of paddy.  From a cluster of women’s faces high on the wall hang long thin ropes that gather on the floor in a heap. “These are tears,” says Rejani, pointing to another work where the women’s nose is pierced, “much like the cow or bulls with a ring to control.” Works inspired by her childhood offer mystery and intrigue. Memories of looking intently through a gap in the window into her grandfather’s room have resulted in pierced doll figures, a squatting form with red and white patches. Rejani mentions period blood, poisonous breast milk and occult rituals. 
A work by artist Rejani S R A work on stray dogs- infected with mange in jute with coir patches- is about a society unmindful of animals that coexist alongside. Another, of slippers covered with spiders and spider web(in jute and coir) is about intimacy and nostalgia. A girl’s face peers scarily from behind a curtain with a knife and rope. “These are what a thief carries but here she has them to protect herself,”says the artist. Another dramatic work is a female form, on the floor, made with sand and mud, with a light aglow on the pelvis. “Worshipped as a Goddess, the woman is violated time and again,” says Rejani. A feminist Rejani’s art is shaped from what she has seen women face around her, “especially my mother.” A student of College of Fine Arts, Mavelikara Rejani completed her MFA in Sculpture from RLV College of Fine Arts, Tripunithura.

1122,"February 09, 2022",15:53 IST,entertainment,art,Yours in anticipation: Insta-gratification and the art of letter writing," When was the last time you waited for a letter? Yet, there is something to be said for the thrill of anticipation and the creative responses it evokes. Bengaluru-based Sandbox Collective paired 11 artists in the city in an attempt to ignite original ideas. Called the See-Saw project, it was conceptualised by Karen D’Mello along with Charulatha Dasappa, Suchaita Tennetia and Aakriti Chandervanshi. “During the pandemic, we were looking at ways to collectively reflect on themes of identity and prejudice, people and communities. That was how we hit upon the idea of using snail mail as a means to develop a sense of collective reflection even while being apart,” says Karen D’Mello. The team identified artists across various disciplines and paired them up anonymously for 11 weeks. They were given the option of choosing their noms de plume as their identities were kept concealed throughout the duration of this project. “By concealing their names, we hoped to sidestep any preconceived notions the artists may have had. Every week, we would send them prompts — tactile objects or activities — to engage in, which were supposed to trigger their creativity. The prompts were open to interpretation and we hoped that if the artists used them as guidelines, it would stimulate creation within a framework.” 
Art work from the See Saw Project initiated by the Sand Box Collective in Bengaluru -- Special Arrangement  Participants would send their partners or ‘penpals’ whatever they had worked on via post. Facilitators would engage every week with uploaded versions of these creations during the exchange, which began in September and concluded in November. “The results were well-thought-out artistic responses to the same as it encouraged the artists to explore art forms apart from their areas of expertise. The focus was on the process rather than the form it took and we hoped it would mark the start of a conversation or an invitation to engage in similar projects,” says Karen. Jeisi Amawasa (her psuedonym), a visual artist and lawyer, says: “What I really liked about this programme was the absence of an audience to interact with or perform for, at least in real time. The fact that I did not have to fit a particular aesthetic was liberating as it helped me move beyond my traditional forte of illustration, to using artistic forms such as collage or writing to express myself.” For Jeisi, the most thought-provoking prompt was the one consisting of bread crumbs, red food colouring, faux fat and a recipe for blood fry. “It made me question if I was as progressive as I thought I was and if certain biases still lurked in me. Though they were fake, the prompts were modelled on objects I am not used to and it made me question my personal take on things. I realised we are all casteist or biased at some level and we need to make a conscious decision to unlearn those notions,”  The purpose of the prompts was to provoke thought — the participants did not have to use them as part of their responses. “I had no idea who I was interacting with and neither did they know who I was — it was a raw experience, communicating with a stranger on such diverse, intimate topics,” says Jeisi. The participants were paired with different artists after five weeks.  For collaborative theatre artiste Lavender Hippo (her pseudonym), who works in areas of gender identity, caste and sexuality, the experience was truly challenging as her skill set is an intangible one. “As an actor, this was the first time I was unable to see my audience and, in a way, it was appealing to work anonymously out of my comfort zone. The first prompt we received was sensory in nature — we were asked to take a walk and ascertain what we felt when faced with certain odours and why. 
Art work from the See Saw Project initiated by the Sand Box Collective in Bengaluru -- Special Arrangement  “I came up with ideas to interact with my pen pal since I wasn’t there physically. I sent them guessing games, a poem and a pen drive with audio and video files. Above all, I wrote to them — a medium I am not comfortable with. This entire project was an opportunity for me to explore ways to express myself.” Among the replies she received, Lavender says the one sent during the second week when the prompts revolved around dating apps, struck a chord. “My pen pal sent me a ball made of strips of chart paper and each strip contained responses one typically saw on a dating site. You realise how superficial the entire process is and the fragile paper ball that could be so easily crushed was an apt indicator. At the same time, there was this realisation that we are all in this together. There are others whom I have not met who experience the same feelings of rejection or acceptance as I; it served as a powerful connect,” she adds. Once the See-Saw project concluded, Sandbox Collective uploaded the completed works on their site with the names of the participating artists. However, the uploaded works still went under pen names. “We tend to believe the art circle is very close, so it was very surprising to see I didn’t know any of the artistes once our names went up on the site,” says Jeisi.

1123,"February 08, 2022",13:14 IST,entertainment,art,Hyderabad artist Maredu Ramu’s works on the landscape changing due to urbanisation," This is a 2022 beginning that Hyderabad-based artist Ramu Maredu has been looking forward to eagerly. The artist who has been a part of many groups shows at the city’s Chitramayee State Gallery of Art, finally has his solo show at the gallery. “I am thrilled as it is my debut solo show,” he smiles.   The exhibition titled ‘Public Place’ includes 25 works in acrylic including two installations done during the lockdown. The narrative is from his ongoing ‘changing cityscape’ series depicting Hyderabad’s transformation in the last two decades. “I am not trying to give a message or comment on what is happening. This is an artist’s expression from the incidents he sees in a public place. The viewers are free to interpret it in their own way,” he says. 
Work by Maredu Ramu The 3x3 feet and 3x4 feet canvases explore aspects of modernisation, giving glimpses of scenes near an under-construction flyover. Different, colourful elements in his canvas represent the transformation — how on the one side, the city is losing its green cover while on the other has become a business hub. With lockdown 2020 written on the blue metal sheets near the construction site, the canvas portrays advertisements, colourful billboards seen from under steel pillars, the ubiquitous Hyderabadi autos and the different stages of the work. “Hyderabad has expanded so much that it is hard to imagine the city that existed earlier. Globalisation is happening in a big way here but pollution is also increasing and the landscape is changing every day.” 
Artist Maredu Ramu Ramu’s interest in observing his surroundings began in 2010 while studying art at the University of Hyderabad. “Our teachers asked us to rely not only on imagination but see what was happening outside the four walls of the classroom to improve our observation skills. That was when I saw work for the ORR (Outer Ring Road) being done and the green cover began to reduce slowly,” he recollects. This result was a constant exploration of the city and a gritty depiction of urban life. “The changing landscape and flyovers series continued as Laxma (Laxma Goud) and Vaikuntham sir (Thota Vaikuntham) suggested I explore the subject further. I worked with Laxma sir too and he encouraged me to paint my feelings and not be concerned about others’ reactions to it.”  The two installations include 4x6 fibre male mannequins that have been painted with a touch of blue, a colour has been a constant in his palette. Once, when walking around a busy street, he found a mannequin dumped outside, it triggered a range of emotions in him and an urge to respond. “The mannequin was damaged. I felt as if a human being and a mannequin were the same. When they become old or damaged, we simply dump them. So I added a touch of beauty to it, making it an engaging artwork.”  (

1124,"February 02, 2022",15:08 IST,entertainment,art,"Bask in tropical paradise, courtesy Remya Kumar"," “Once you dedicate yourself and decide on a path, all kinds of opportunities come your way,” says artist Remya Kumar with a laugh. ‘Nature’s Spell,’ an exhibition of her work is currently underway in Bengaluru, but the architect-turned-artist believes her foray into the world of paints and palettes was nothing short of ‘serendipitous’. “As a child, my proficiency in art was limited to copying from photographs and other paintings. While you churn out excellent copies, the image becomes a crutch and you can’t create from your imagination. I didn’t know how to create from scratch; I always need reference material because I had never exercised my creative muscles.” Remya got a chance to find her way around this mind block when she enrolled in an art class, while pursuing her architecture degree in the US. “Initially, I was overwhelmed by our art assignments but the teachers encouraged us to work with different ideas, colours, textures and media. This was my foray into experimentation and it unlocked the real understanding of self discovery.”  “I realised to create real art you need to be free and not be scared of making mistakes because that is when you explore and learn new things,” she says. Even as she was riding on this new-found wave of self discovery, Remya says she was inspired by the community of daily painters who complete an entire canvas in a day — from start to finish. Soon after, she attended an art camp in Trivandrum where she met Chennai-based artist A V Illango. “He saw some potential in my work and offered to teach me creative painting if I wished.” Remya describes her stint at Illango’s studio a life changing experience where she learnt what it meant to live an artist’s life in terms of discipline, commitment, grit and socialising. “One needs to meet other artists to learn from them and their work constantly.” A brief return to architecture only made Remya realise her creative abilities were not being harnessed to the full and she took to painting full time. “Sometimes there is a longing for change and discovery, and at those times you go back to basics. That happened to me during the lockdown and I began sketching again. The pandemic forced many of us to look inwards and re-evaluate, causing a shift in creative expression. For me, it was a chance to explore change without worrying about the consequences of social media or art shows.” “I also began using mixed media — different types of paper, crayons, charcoal, inks and different tools. I love it when two inks mix and form a pattern that I could never have foreseen. Along the way, there is so much you discover during the little moments and I’ve learnt the process is just as important as the finished product.”  The results are plain to see in ‘Nature’s Spell’ where unusual shades of mauve, indigo, ochre and crimson evoke memories of lush tropical foliage, reminiscent of Remya’s hometown in Kerala, where she spent a few months of the lockdown. “The distinctive greenery of that place leaves a mark on you — coconut palms and banana plants jostle with mango and jackfruit trees everywhere you look. I was literally looking out of the window and painting,” she says. Presented by ArtenBleu ‘Nature’s Spell’ featuring acrylic on canvas and mixed media on paper is on display at The Gallery @ Maya in Jayanagar, Bengaluru till February 14.

1125,"February 02, 2022",12:54 IST,entertainment,art,Pictorial narratives in calligraphy,"  There’s a lyrical rhythm with which Hyderabad-based artist Poosapati Parameshwar Raju uses pens and nibs of different sizes to draw alluring crimson red calligraphic forms on paper. The artist is recognised for his minimalistic narratives of stories from mythology. In Divine Rhythm, a new exhibition that showcases 95 of his recent works, opened online (
art.kunstmatrix.com/ ) as part of the Hyderabad Literary Festival 2022 and will be on view all this month.
 The exhibition offers an insight into a wide range of his work - stories from the Puranas, the epics, Buddhism, Christianity and the illustrations of Aum, to name a few. The calligraphy featured in this exhibition will also be a part of a forthcoming book penned by curator Koeli Mukherji. “The book will be a deep dive into his life, tracing his journey from childhood and attempting to trace the evolution of his style of calligraphy. He is a man of few words and hence, while his imagery is widely recognised, not many know what shaped his work,” says Koeli. Parameshwar Raju spent the pandemic-induced lockdowns neck-deep at work. The result is a new series on Adi Ganesha, Ramayana and the Aum; he also reworked a 2013 series depicting the story of Jesus: “I had done a Story of Jesus series for an exhibition in Delhi in 2013. When I revisited them, I felt the need to tweak the images. The new drawings are complex with more elements. This story had to look and feel different to represent a different era and community.” 
Calligraphy by Parameshwar Raju from the exhibition In Divine Rhythm for Hyderabad Literary Festival 2022 For those who are familiar with his oeuvre and his extensive illustrations of any series, be it the Ramayana, the Puri Jagannadh series, the Dasavatara or the Shiva Purana, it might appear as though he works on a series from start to finish, resting only when he has completed narrating a story. However, the artist discloses that his approach is non-linear: “I read up on a topic and think of how I can narrate an event in a simplified calligraphic form. Once I get the hang of how the nib has to move for a character, I add elements to give the series a distinct texture. I may not work on a series at a stretch.” He cites the example of how he began drawing the Aum and it lent itself to a series on Hanuman: “I was drawing the different representations of Aum and stumbled upon how I could work on the form of Hanuman.”  A drawing of the Nandi and an image of Hanuman in the court of Ravana are examples of his minimalistic works. On the contrary, there are other richly detailed stories. The calligraphy depicting Kartikeya flying on a peacock to circumnavigate the world while Ganesha circumnavigates his parents Shiva and Parvathi as sage Narada watches on, is an example. 
Calligraphy by Parameshwar Raju from the exhibition In Divine Rhythm for Hyderabad Literary Festival 2022 Devoid of facial features and expressions, it is left to the bold calligraphic strokes to convey the emotion, and they do so evocatively. An image of Ganesha dancing and playing the drum is joyous to behold.  A retrospective showcase on Parameshwar Raju’s various series is on the cards at the Museum of Sacred Art, Belgium.

1126,"January 28, 2022",15:14 IST,entertainment,art,Chennai Photo Biennale goes hybrid; invites us to reorient how we view history," Community of Parting is a 70-minute film in ‘Maps of Disquiet’, the hybrid exhibition stitched between virtual space and physical venues, part of the third edition of the Chennai Photo Biennale (CPB).
 The film, by Copenhagen-based Jane Jin Kaisen, documents the stories of war, loss, and pain that women in particular embody. Tracing itself to a Korean myth about goddess Bari and her abandonment as a child, the film leads one through the reconciliation and healing practices among women shamans who transit between the living and the dead. They find voices for the dead to come alive in the present, to strengthen and comfort the living through the continuity of grief.  There is a philosophy. “I understand social death to be the ultimate abandonment, but the shamanistic approach would be that which opens up and enables, if you are outside of conventional notions of history and conventional notions of space and time. You can see different things. You need this kind of death to be able to have a more complex image of the world and of the relation. So
then and
there become completely different concepts. It is not a singular event. You have to orient yourself permanently, every day in relation to history, to time, to space,” narrates the voice of a woman juxtaposed with the image of a waterfall, two poles at the bottom standing upright from the rocks, human-like, fragile paper cutouts dangling on each of them. The image moves slowly to the close-up of a translucent paper face, letting the golden sunlight pass through, arms flapping in the wind.
 
A still from Jane Jin Kaisen’s film ‘Community of Parting’. Curated during precarious times, dodging uncertainties, and illustrating the possibility of experiencing an exhibition through different modes of interaction, Arko Datto, Boaz Levin, Kerstin Meincke, and Bhooma Padmanabhan have conjured up multiple lenses, inviting audiences “to have a more complex image of the world”. The curatorial context is set within the overlapping frameworks of colonialism, those marginalised in the process of nation-building, mining, consumption, socio-environmental disruption, loneliness within crowded habitations, and protagonists without autonomy. Set against a pandemic that is forcing us to find new ways to interact, the exhibition is a window into the ever-shrinking, isolated world of artists and curators. Online, the works take one into the interiority of worlds and at times to expansive landscapes. The screening rooms transform into intimate viewing windows for the films. There are two issues of a journal of podcasts, essays, and visual projects. The physical venues are dispersed across small spaces, private and public, in the city, and are a relief from the home and the screen, yielding to the physical need to touch and see the light captured in images with different sensorial experiences. 
Gauri Gill’s ‘1984’ notebook.  Madras Literary Society, a colonial-era library, invites one with the smell of old books, some untouched for years. In a room along the back corridor are two large tables with B&W prints held in place by grey pebbles. These are from the notebook ‘1984’
,  by photographer Gauri Gill. The photos, drawings, and texts, as well as accounts, stories, and reflections by artists and writers on the anti-Sikh pogrom of 1984 hark back to a past that has repeatedly played out in different contexts and locations to a point where it is all too familiar. The photographs are reminders of the past and come alive in the present as politicised brutality. Using photo-stories of many such moments, the exhibition takes image-making beyond the indexical, leading one into a labyrinthian journey of history.
 In the 19th century, photography as a documenting tool was rigorously used, and its presence was strongly felt in the colonies. In the then Madras, experiments with photography were undertaken in Madras School of Arts, today the Government College of Fine Arts. The medium encompasses an interesting history of seeing, capturing, and conquering. From its early role as tool for documentation, photography moved into the realm of imagination, blurring fact and fiction, attempting to articulate the intangible through the tangible. In ‘Maps of Disquiet’, the nature of photography as evidence is invoked and simultaneously challenged, as it chronicles diverse accounts. 
‘Chicken Run’ by Parvathi Nayar and Nayantara Nayar. One of CPB’s commissioned projects is the Keeladi excavation of the ancient Vaigai civilisation near Madurai in Tamil Nadu. In ‘Excavating an Imagination’ at Forum Art Gallery, the sequence of large photographs and texts examines the nature of imaging a significant site and the methods of investing it with contemporary meaning. The collaborative project by Andreas Langfeld and Sarabhi Ravichandran questions the fictional nature of image-making within the scientific process of documentation. Photography here can become a tool to build intended narratives, as opposed to the single notion of ‘truth’ it epitomises, in the way it captures the physicality of objects, sites, scales, landscapes, people and their bodies. Senthil Kumaran Rajendran’s ‘Tamed Wild Tuskers’, also at the gallery, gives one a glimpse into the lives of Kurumba, Kattu Nayakkar, and Malasar tribal mahouts who work with elephants in the Western Ghats. The B&W photographs narrate the complex relationship between forest, people, and animals.  The mahouts train the tuskers to become
kumkis  that can control other wild elephants, building lifelong relationships of trust through rituals of feeding and grooming, communicating through words, sounds and touch. Senthil poignantly registers these nuanced emotions with the tonal intricacies of his images.
 
A still from Babu Eshwar Prasad’s ‘Fast Forward to Zero’. Babu Eshwar Prasad’s works at Ashvita art gallery lead us through panoramic landscapes of mines, brick-making fields, and industrial spaces. In one of the composite images, the beautiful landscape is selectively focused through the viewfinder of a camera obscura, omitting the mining site below. The landscape inside the larger frame is set on a lavish balcony overlooking the wounded underbelly. In the fantastical scenarios that Prasad has summoned, the extensive nature of extracting and altering can be observed in the horizontal layout of the photographs and in the movement of the film from one end to another, as if viewing a single expanse from the window of a moving vehicle. The minute detailing and even resolution reminds one of satellite imaging.  Online, Harun Farocki’s
Workers Leaving the Factory (1995)
 focuses on the organised labour force, the title invoking the 1895 film by the Lumiere Brothers,
Workers Leaving the Lumiere Factory , a 45-second work that was the first motion picture produced and shown in public. That film was shot with a fixed frame, capturing the moving image of men and women leaving the gate of their factory in Lyon. Farocki compiles footage, starting with the Lumiere film, with other B&W movies, musicals and documentaries of workers leaving the factory to visually evoke the drama around exploited workers, the binaries of power, the lack of jobs, and the never-ending wait outside factory gates.
 
Exhibits at Roja Muthiah Research Library, one of the venues. As a tool of modernity, the camera privileges an anthropocentric viewing of the world. From the image capturing and transferring techniques that developed after early innovations in understanding properties of refraction and photosensitive chemicals, photography has journeyed to find collective social meaning, evolving into a tool of self-expression, accessible to all. As an archive of time and space, if carefully mediated, it can trigger crucial engagements. The curators of CPB’s third edition have responded to the critical questions of the times. Living in times of image saturation, stringing together visuals and facilitating the process of experiencing them is more than just a curatorial challenge. It is an invitation to reorient oneself to view history and its presence in more ways than as a ‘singular event’. The performativity of the image has played out in interesting ways in this exhibition, especially in tackling the notion of imaging the future. A photograph is also a prophecy, a map to navigate the unknown. Going back to the shamanism in Kaisen’s film, if we see it as a process of cleansing, a way to come to terms with our fractured worlds, then what does it mean to be outside conventional notions of time and space? How do we orient ourselves with history? ‘Maps of Disquiet’ emerges as a possible compass for this journey.

1127,"January 25, 2022",18:57 IST,entertainment,art,Telangana artists paint on a scroll to celebrate the unsung heroes of the freedom struggle," On January 26 when India celebrates its 73rd Republic Day, a gigantic, 750-metre scroll will adorn the open gallery at Rajpath, New Delhi. As part of Kala Kumbh - Azaadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav, the scroll filled with drawings and figurative narratives by 500 artistes from across India, including a team of eight artists from Telangana, is an artistic tribute to the unsung heroes of the freedom struggle. The Telangana artists include: Kandi Narsimulu, G Pramod Reddy, Gunram Mallesham, Mahesh Pottabathini, Naresh Kumar Pallati, Annarapu Narender and J Venkateshwarlu. 
Team of artists
This team has painted 75 meters in the scroll depicting Telangana’s freedom fighters who used art and literature to inspire people during the Freedom movement. “We were also asked to paint themes highlighting Telangana’s culture, its people and monuments,” says Mahesh. “The compositions are different, but with the sky as a common element across 75 metres, the works feel like a continuous unit.”
 How it started Organised by National Gallery of Modern Art in New Delhi, the scroll was painted earlier during an art camp conducted at Chitkara University campus in Chandigarh in December 2021.  Retired art teacher Naresh Kumar Pallati recreates September 17, 1948 when Hyderabad State integrated into India. The work shows a battle tank entering the city with a family on a rickshaw. Nizam VII Mir Osmal Ali Khan of Hyderabad welcomes the then Home minister Sardar Vallabhai Patel, against the backdrop of the Indian flag and Charminar.   Naresh explains, “I had heard many tales of Nizam’s generosity from my grandfather. While it is a fact that Nizam took time to surrender Hyderabad, it was due to Kasim Razwi, his
Sipah Salar ( military commander). Nizam’s good intent shows when he helped during the Indo-China war.”
 Ode to women warriors  Mahesh Pottabathini created the portrait of Arutla Kamala Devi, the activist of the Telangana Armed Rebellion. “She and her partner created a guerilla force to fight against the
Razakars  . Her story is fascinating. It is a show of strength for women in combat as there is also a painting of Mallu Swarjyam, who was considered the iron lady of the Telangana armed struggle. We rarely talk about the women leading the march in combat during the freedom struggle. We feel proud to have painted these legendary women and brought them into focus.”
 Telangana’s icons  This platform is a great opportunity to display our works in front of such a large audience,” shares J Venkateshwarlu. The artist painted the historical arch Kakateeya thoranam, and Telangana’s symbols such as
Jinka (deer),
jammi chettu ( Prosopis cineraria),
tangedu puvvu  (dandelion) and
pala pitta  (Indian Roller bird) reflecting the state’s culture and tradition. “Painting on such a gigantic scroll was a new experience for the artists. We used to first sketch and then fill acrylic waterproof colours in it,” he adds.
 Inspiring poets  The song
Palleturi pillagaada, paalu taage jeeta gada by noted poet Suddala Hanmanthu has been artist Gunram Mallesham’s iconic freedom song. “Even now the song gives me goosebumps; I have been hearing this song since my childhood and am glad I got an opportunity to paint the person who wrote such stirring lyrics” he says. His portrait of Suddala celebrates the poet’s writings that gave voice to the voiceless. “Suddala was a seasoned writer, poet and
burra katha  artiste. He resigned his job as a school teacher to inspire people through poetry and raise a voice against oppression. ”
 Poets in focus 
Artists paint Dasarathi Krishnamacharya and Kaloji Narayana Rao. Artist Shiva Kumar Gadiga painted poet Dasarathi Krishnamacharya and poet-activist Kaloji Narayana Rao. He recollected his college days in Warangal when he had read poems of the duo. “Most poets are unsung heroes of freedom struggle as they work behind the scenes inspiring people through their writings. These remarkable personalities have to be celebrated,” says Shiva, whose themes include political and personal issues inspired by his natural surroundings. “This was the first time that I painted a freedom fighter,” says Pramod Reddy, who painted revolutionary tribal leader Komaram Bheem. “I tried to understand his personality through books and his fiery speeches,” Pramod also painted Tholubommalata, a shadow puppet theatre tradition of the erstwhile combined state of Andhra Pradesh and a work on Lord Rama and Hanuman. “The role of mythology is significant in motivating people,” says the artist who mostly does mythological works. Pramod continues, “It was fascinating to see eight artistes with different painting styles come together on one platform. Folk festival in focus  Annarapu Narender, who usually paints three-dimensional figures, painted Bonalu, the traditional folk festival of Telangana. The artist also worked with NCC students by sketching Bhagat Singh and Subhash Chandra Bose which the students filled with colours. “The camp felt like home. Although we were meeting the artists for the first time, it felt like we were meeting our relatives in a new place. The cultural activities held at night gave us so many nice memories,” says Narender.", Neeraja Murthy,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/telangana-artists-paint-on-a-scroll-to-celebrate-the-unsung-heroes-of-the-freedom-struggle/article38324582.ece
1128,"January 24, 2022",20:26 IST,entertainment,art,Glimpses of coastal life with artists Mohan Naik and Sivabalan," There is far more to a beach destination than surf, sand, sunshine and an unbroken coastline as far as eye can see. Artists Sivabalan and Mohan Naik capture the domestic life of residents and not tourists, in their canvases that are a part of ‘Stories of the Land’. This virtual exhibition hosted by Bengaluru’s KYNKYNY art gallery and curated by Namu Kini is exhibiting around 14 canvases by each artist. “Everyone cherishes moments of nostalgia where memories fill you with warmth. It is incredible when an artist can evoke that emotion and touch your heart with his work. All artists are trying to tell stories; Mohan Naik and Sivabalan take you back to a simpler time with their work,” says Namu, co-founder of KYNKYNY.com. Mohan Naik who hails from a farming family in South Goa says his childhood memories are manifested on his canvases. “As a child, I used to be fascinated by shepherds and their flock, but now, that landscape is changing and you hardly see them,” he says. The artist who has used oils and acrylic in this series, says he worked on them for the better part of a year. Mohan, who graduated from the Goa College of Art, says unlike many of his peers who prefer a Westernised art form, he chose to pursue traditional Indian craftsmanship. “This is reflected in my techniques and figures, which are quite unlike others.” Forest glades and pastoral scenes in pastel shades and earthy tones are the hallmarks of Mohan’s work.  For Sivabalan, his mother’s
rangoli (kolam ) designs were his first brush with art. “She used a lot of geometrical shapes with contrasting colours and her patterns were different every day. They stood out from the rest of the homes on our street,” says Sivabalan.
 With the temple town of Kumbakonam being his hometown, Sivabalan grew up in the hustle and bustle of rural life. “I was observing people in their environment and they fascinated me. I began travelling across South India and started capturing those rare moments that are a part of our culture. That became my signature style,” says Sivabalan, adding, “Just by looking at my paintings, I can easily relive those memories and places.” Roadside vendors, friendly neighbours and affable strangers, temple elephants and everyday scenes from any small town in India come to life in the bright watercolours that Sivabalan has employed in this series. “Everyone’s idea of rural life is different. By depicting forms rather than faces, I hope to capture those feelings that inspired me to paint.”Starting from ₹ 40,000 to ₹ 3 lakh, canvases from the ‘Stories of the Land’ series will be on display till January 31. Those wishing to view the paintings in person or over a video call can log on to kynkyny.com for more details.",Ruth Dhanaraj,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/glimpses-of-coastal-life-with-artists-mohan-naik-and-sivabalan/article38319886.ece
1129,"January 21, 2022",16:11 IST,entertainment,art,"When governments restrict creation, guerrilla art gets energised: Afghan artist Amanullah Mojadidi"," He is heavily but aesthetically tattooed in French, Sanskrit and Japanese. But that is only the exterior embellishment to the demeanour of prominent U.S.-born Afghan visual artist Amanullah Mojadidi. The artist, who divides his time between Paris and Kabul, is not exactly a torn soul. On the one hand, he is opposed to the “totalitarianism of the Taliban”, which he describes as “an incredibly restrictive movement.” On the other, he shows measured pragmatism and cautious optimism even as Taliban 2.0 now appears to be firmly ensconced in the power apparatus. The 50-year-old with a brooding persona, piercing eyes and flowing beard has pilloried warlords, Western militias and governments with his tongue-in-cheek yet overt artworks. Credited with playing an important role in the resurgence of art in Afghanistan, he has worked with young Afghans to promote graffiti as art. Fresh from his return from Italy, where he curated a major art exhibition and public programme on Afghanistan, Mojadidi takes time off to talk about the situation in his home country and how it impacts him. Excerpts: What do you think Afghanistan will reverberate with — the lilt of the rubab (string instrument that is the mainstay of Afghan classical music), or the shrillness of a fanatic regime? In its earlier avatar, this regime had dynamited out of existence two 6th century statues of Buddha and plundered the national museum. I think it will settle into something in between. The rush to condemn the Taliban is certainly not without reason, but if we look at other extremely Islamic states in the world (such as Iran or Saudi Arabia), we see places where art and culture are heavily controlled by the state, but nevertheless there is artistic and cultural production taking place. I think once the dust settles, we will eventually see something similar in Afghanistan. What exactly it will look like remains to be seen. As an artist, how has it impacted your creative pursuit and worldview? I must admit that I find myself thinking a lot about Nuristan, the last province in Afghanistan to be forcefully converted to Islam in 1895. I’ve painted two works (painting not being something I often use or am very skilled at but it feels right for these works) — one called ‘Nuristani Tree Spirit #1’ and another ‘Nuristani Dancing Man #1’. These are simple paintings. ‘Tree Spirit’ is an abstract rendition of a white entity emerging from between trunk and crown; the animism speaking to an older shamanism that pre-dates Islam in the region. ‘Dancing Man’ is a very tribal, almost cave painting rendition of a naked man dancing. I’m now working on ‘Nuristani Dancing Woman #1’. Their freedom to be nude and dance speaks out to the totalitarianism of the Taliban. In August last year, UNESCO appealed for the protection of Afghanistan’s cultural heritage. In fact, 12 art trade associations from the U.S. and Europe have joined hands to prevent Afghan art from being trafficked in the West following the Taliban takeover. Do you think there is a real threat? I don’t think we will see the same kind of attitude as earlier by the Taliban towards Afghanistan’s cultural heritage. Just the other day, the Taliban announced that all Afghan cultural heritage, Islamic and pre-Islamic, is important and must be protected. Are these mere words to appease the international community? Maybe. Only time will tell.  The U.S. in particular, and Western democracies in general, showed incredible pusillanimity by abruptly withdrawing from Afghanistan. There are even reports that the U.S. is working on a road map for according recognition to the Taliban government. There is concern over possible blowback. What’s your take? What I find interesting about the world’s attitude towards the West, and the U.S. in particular, in Afghanistan is that everyone screams murder when the U.S. invades the country and then everyone screams abandonment when they leave. Could they have left differently so the withdrawal impact might have been more manageable? Yes. But in my opinion, even if they withdrew slowly five years ago or five years from now, the result would have been the same. Afghanistan’s Ministry of Education directed all secondary schools to resume classes from September 18 last year. However, it is ominously silent on a return date for girls, which is contrary to the promises made by the Taliban. Women are being barred from going to work, and they have staged demonstrations to seek employment and education. What will happen, you think? I think this is perhaps going to be one of the issues that will need the closest attention. The Taliban just banned forced marriage in the country, and so this could be a sign that they are not going to work entirely against the rights of women. But what they perceive as the rights of women, and whether education and work are part of those rights, remains to be seen. Do you find any fundamental difference between the Taliban in 1995-2001 and its latest incarnation? Ostensibly, Taliban 2.0 is behaving more responsibly. However, it may be mere tokenism.  No doubt, there are differences
.  But they will certainly still remain an incredibly restrictive movement
, and will no doubt limit and/ or turn back many things that have taken place in the past 20 years. However, as I said earlier, I think when the dust settles, there will be something different. It may not be what we want, but it won’t be what we expect either.
 You have said earlier that religion is losing its integrity, becoming less pure. How far is that relevant in the context of Afghanistan? I don’t think less pure is really accurate, but rather less than what it was originally meant to be: each person’s individual capacity to communicate with a universal spirit. I think the biggest problem with Afghanistan and any other Islamic state in the world is that they are exactly that — Islamic states. As far as I’m concerned, a government should be secular, its people should be whatever they want to be religiously, and practise whatever makes sense to them. Did you ever face a direct threat from the Taliban? Have you exhibited your work in Afghanistan? You said you are indulging in a sort of guerrilla art. What does it mean?  I never had threats from the Taliban, but did have a small issue with the government for which I had to keep a low profile so they wouldn’t find me until it passed. I think when governments set restrictions on creation, guerrilla art becomes energised.
 For this reason, I am actually very curious to see what might come to be created under the current Taliban regime.

1130,"January 19, 2022",16:55 IST,entertainment,art,Senior Chennai artist K Shyam Kumar’s drawings and sculptures are on display after 15 years," K Shyam Kumar’s drawings command the viewer’s undivided attention. Each painting is exquisitely detailed, a continuum of lines and dots that forge into forts, pyramid-like structures and humanesque faces. Part of a pen and ink series titled The Steps for Mukhti, the drawings are on show at an exhibition, My Planet, at the Varija Art Gallery in DakshinaChitra. The show features 15 drawings and 25 sculptures in bronze and granite. These drawings, which are on layered and textured surfaces, are part of his works from the 2000s.  The Chennai-based artist and sculptor, who prefers to work in seclusion, has not had a solo show in 20 years. “I take at least four months to six on a painting,” he says, of his long-drawn out creative process. Shutting off from the noise of the world, Shyam often withdraws into his own, consumed by the work. “It all begins with the dot,” he says of the drawings, which contain thousands of dots each. “It demands utmost patience and for me, it is a meditative process.” 
One of Shyam Kumar’s dotted drawings  Shyam, who holds a post-graduate diploma in Sculpture from the Government College of Arts and Crafts, Chennai, began his art practice as early as 1979. He says he is intrigued by the infinity of the cosmos, its darkness and the void.Critics regard his works a blend of mysticism, fantasy and science fiction. One of his earliest works, a terracotta sculpture that he made as a student, was an elongated figurine, resembling Steven Spielberg’s
E.T , which drew mixed responses at the time.
 
A stone sculpture Though Shyam works with stone and bronze for his sculptures, terracotta is his enduring passion. He has just completed an eight-foot-tall terracotta sculpture at Dakshinachitra, which is waiting to be fired. At the show, while the granite sculptures seem to be in a meditative trance, eyes closed, the bronze ones have their eyes open. “If you notice, none of the sculptures have ears,” says Shyam, adding they are representative of his own self in isolation, refusing to let in the clatter of the world.

Among the tortoises that stand to gain from the art show are a pair of Galapagos tortoises aged above 120 and a pair of Aldabra tortoises that are over 90. Hyderabad-based artist and curator Bolgum Nagesh Goud will be presenting Kurma, an exhibition of tortoise sculptures painted by 15 well-known Indian artists, at the State Gallery of Art, Hyderabad, on January 21 and 22: “We have already sold 12 of the sculptures to buyers who showed keen interest. We will be donating ₹2.5 to ₹3.5 lakh, once the sale is completed,” says Goud. 
Artist and curator Bolgum Nagesh Goud The artists who have painted the three-dimensional fibre glass tortoise sculptures measuring 27x13x16 inches are Jagdish Chinthala, Bose Krishnamachari, Laxman Aelay, Srinivas Reddy B, Subrata Das, Sachin Jaltare, Ramesh Gorjala, Vinita Dasgupta, Ganapati Hegde, Siddharth Shingade, Meenakshi Jha Banerjee, Bandana Kumari, Arpitha Reddy, Bhushaiah and Nagesh Goud. In 2020, Goud curated the exhibition Gaja that showcased 25 painted sculptures of elephants. “We contributed ₹3.5 lakh from the sales proceeds for the upkeep of elephant Sita in the Nehru Zoological park,” he recalls. The new show Kurma emerged as a follow-up to Gaja and thematically alludes to the second avatar of Lord Vishnu. “I asked my artist friends to paint the sculptures to the theme of the Samudra Manthan story from mythology,” says Goud. 
Painted tortoise sculptures for the Kurma art exhibition, Hyderabad While the sculpture he painted bears images of Kamadhenu, Airavata, Lakshmi, moon and the Kalpavriksha that emerged from the churning of the ocean, others artists have given their own interpretations to the theme. For instance, Ramesh Gorjala depicted Ashtalakshmi while Bose Krishnamachari and Jagdish Chintala who are known for their bold abstract touches, let their colours do the talking. Taking a cue from Nature, Ganapati Hegde’s painting depicts the 10 avatars through leaves. Plans are afoot to open Kurma for viewing at the State Gallery of Art on January 21 and 22, from 12 noon to 6 p.m., adhering to COVID-19 safety protocols. In addition, the exhibits can be viewed on Nagesh Goud’s Facebook and Instagram accounts from January 21.", Sangeetha Devi Dundoo,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/kurma-an-art-showcase-is-raising-funds-for-the-tortoises-at-nehru-zoological-park-hyderabad/article38290054.ece
1132,"January 13, 2022",11:32 IST,entertainment,art,"So, you want to be a video game artist... Paul Jones’ career guide will have you level up"," There was a time veteran video games artist Paul Jones was working 84-hour work weeks. He recalls how the stress of working in this contentious creative industry had him stressed out and saw his mind and body start to give up. Not wanting his health to decline further, Jones took matters into his own hands and years later, he shares that though he is the furthest thing from a sporty person, he gets frequent sports massages.  Jones, an artist at heart, has now released
The Ultimate Career Guide: Game Artist,  the world’s first “professional and artistic pipeline” for the games industry. He says if you have ever wanted to make a case for becoming a video games artist, no time like the present. Home-bound routines of the past two years have segued into an unprecedented gaming boom which led to a lot of curiosity around careers in this burgeoning industry.
 (Stay up to date on new book releases, reviews, and more with The Hindu On Books newsletter. Subscribe here.)  Having long observed a gap in online and offline discussions around creating a career in this space, Jones he was putting together
Game Artist . So the timing of the book’s release is pretty remarkable, he agrees on a video call from his home in England.
 Jones has more than 25 years of experience in the industry; his portfolio spanning some of the most personable games such as the largest-ever crowdfunded game Star Citizen (for Cloud Imperium Games where he is an art director). Prior to this, Jones also worked on titles including LEGO City Undercover (TT Fusion’s largest open-world LEGO game), Batman Arkham City (Rocksteady), Unreal Tournament 3 and Unreal Championship 2 (Epic Games), and Battlestar Galactica (Warthog).   (Sign up to our Technology newsletter, Today’s Cache, for insights on emerging themes at the intersection of technology, business and policy. Click here to subscribe for free.) Having worked for many smaller studios as well, Jones laughs and says he “prefers the underdog.” He recalls, “When I worked for Epic, there were only 50 of us, and when I worked for Rocksteady, only 12 people worked on the environment team for Batman: Arkham City (now environment teams comprise up to 100 artists). So the company cultures at these places are more nuanced and tighter because indie studios push the boundaries and move out of the stereotypes of what video games have presented for decades.” That said, Jones made sure the book would benefit artists in both the indie and the AAA spaces.   Though Jones has been in the industry for two decades, for
Game Artist , he went into the process with a “beginners’ mindset”, to put himself in the shoes of the reader and answer every question one might have. It was originally templated at two works: one of his journey and the other of the general career path, so he ended up merging the two, offering up slices from his own experience to supplement the narrative. Jones has also interviewed his long-time friend and collaborator Jerry O’Flaherty who is the art director of Gears Of War (2006) to bring more dimensions into the book.

Epic Games on Unreal Engine 5, and why it has the right building blocks for the open metaverse Whether one is a budding junior artist or a veteran art director or working in management, Jones breaks down what each tier of the game art world has to offer in terms of mentorship, upskilling, applying for jobs, networking, weekly work-life, and mental health. He lines up establishing a ‘healthy self’ while working with climbing a mountain – in that it is always an uphill battle. As with all industries, the obstacles one potentially faces include creative block, negative environments and team conflict, as well as physical health aspects such as sitting at your desk properly.  Jones wants to humanise the experience of working in the games industry as well; in the book, he shares not just the mistakes he has made over the years but also how he developed from them. “I used to be a bit of a perfectionist then realised the need to back off,” he recalls. “Of course, there are varying levels in the severity of mistakes so the book covers how to work with that. It comes with the territory of working with so many people in a ‘crunch culture’.”  Having been in this world for well over two decades, Jones has seen a lot of change in different areas.  One of the biggest debates in game design and artistry is to do with gender; be it designing women characters or how women game designers are placed in the industry. Game companies such as Activision Blizzard is currently in the hot-seat for their mistreatment of female employees and over-sexualisation of female and LGBTQ+ characters.    Given
Game Artist taps into fostering healthy work environments, Jones thinks aloud, “Why even is there a gender pay gap at some game design studios? If your company has a good culture and talent, it shows in the games that push away from stereotypes. We need more women in management roles; too often we see women in junior roles transitioning out of the industry because they happen to work in a ‘dude club’ with a lot of sexism. It’s not just about recruiting the right people, it’s also about retaining them.”
  Just as with any entertainment industry, there runs a high chance of rejection from not just studios but fans too. Recent games that have fuelled some nasty fire among fans include Keanu Reeves-starrer Cyberpunk 2077, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla and Battlefield 2042. So, should an artist worry about the failure of a published product? Jones says this is a mixed bag depending on the visual substance of the game, but the underlying response is they should not. “If you decide to move onto another company, you still have your good artwork. So an art director can look at your work and that title and say ‘that project bombed, but the art was good’.”  Though most artists in the game industry feel they should be entrepreneurial with their skills, Jones does not consider himself a ‘businessman’, so to speak — he remains an artist at heart. “From the outset, I wanted
Game Artist to be a helping hand... like the book is your Sherpa. With social media, I’ve seen more people speak out about the need for attention towards mental health in the workspace and why we need to change a lot of the dynamic,” he explains, adding, “That said, I inserted that right at the start of the book with the junior artist section; even if people who read it don’t follow it, a seed has been planted in the back of their mind.”

1133,"January 13, 2022",11:16 IST,entertainment,art,Around the world with Nirupam Konwar’s watercolours," There is a reason pop culture often depicts artists as painting in the great outdoors. “Nothing equals capturing an original setting in natural light,” says artist Nirupam Konwar talking about his series, ‘Travel Chronicles,’ on displayat the MKF Museum of Art in Bengaluru. Nirupam who hails from Assam, fell in love with painting and watercolours as a child when his parents enrolled him for art classes. However, his brush with the international art scene began when he submitted a couple of his canvases to a International Watercolour Society contest in 2014. “Until then, painting was a hobby for me. When I was placed fourth in this contest, I was motivated to continue working with watercolours.” The artist who graduated from Guwahati Art College with a degree in Fine Arts, entered the gaming industry as a developer and today works a senior concept for an educational platform. 
Artist Nirupam Konwar In 2017, Nirupam was invited to Italy for a demo on watercolours. Workshops and shows in Taiwan, France and Germany followed soon after. “There was a dockyard in Sperlonga, Italy, which was beautiful — it was the first time I was attempting to paint a seascape and I loved the experience of working outdoors. Right there I understood that it was something I wanted to do for life.” According to Nirupam, the best way to capture an image is on location. “I can’t use watercolours indoors, neither can I paint from memory — I have to be on site. I capture 80% of the painting outdoors and then add smaller details later,” says the 34-year-old, who admits there have been instances when he has had to photograph the scene before the natural light waned. “There is something magical about watercolours. It is a free flowing medium and you never know what the final output will be like. It is a challenging medium to work with because mistakes are not too easy to rectify, unlike oils and acrylic. I simply love it.” 
Paintings by artist Nirupam Konwar For Nirupam, travel holds more than spectacular landscapes that inspire a painting. “We don’t accomplish much by sitting at home. We should step out of our boundaries, our comfort zones, and see firsthand what is going on outside. My goal is to paint reality and not from memory; for that I need to be out and about.” He began capturing the beauty of the North Eastern states of Assam, Arunachal and Meghalaya. “The hills there are beautiful and I love working amidst Nature. When I relocated to Bengaluru, Lal Bagh and Cubbon Park were some of my initial subjects. Gradually I moved on to cityscapes and the like,” says the artist who was named brand ambassador for two Russian watercolour companies in 2018. With prices starting from ₹ 25,000, around 20 canvases from Nirupam Konwar’s series ‘Travel Chronicles’ created over the past five years, will be on display at the MKF Museum of Art in Bengaluru till January 23.",Ruth Dhanaraj,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/around-the-world-with-nirupam-konwars-watercolours/article38264450.ece

A part of the proceeds of the exhibition go towards government-recognised Mumbai-based NGO Alert Citizen Forum (ACF). In its sixth edition, the annual exhibition showcases over 100 artworks of 40 senior and young artists from across India and two artists —Ameet Pai and Komal Gupta settled abroad (Switzerland and London). The work selection process was a detailed one that took almost three months to complete, points out Satyendra. With the rising Covid-19 cases, the earlier planned grand opening ceremony had to be scaled down with bare minimum number of guests and mandatory temperature checks and mask protocol at all times.  “The art ecosystem,” feels Satyendra Rane, “is geared to favour established artists, and for us at Sahayog, it has always been important to provide a platform that would give unknown faces and talents a chance to shine alongside the known ones. We have a history of bringing forth artists who may be from different professions but are also inclined towards art.”  The participating artists include Adyot Rajadhyaksha, Amberhuues Tania, Anupama Mandavkar, Arpita Kolhatkar, Arpito Gope, Arvind Kolapkar, Bhagyashri Choudhari, Deepa Hekre, Dr Shankar Sharma, Ganesh Hire, Ganpat Bhadke, Harshada Tondwalkar, Ishwar Shetty, Joe D'souza, Kariyappa Hanchinamani, Kasim Kanasavi, Monica Kharkar, Mukund Ketkar, Nandita Desai, Nishtha Jhunjhunwala, Niyati Gope, Onkar Murthy, Prasad Mane, Prashant Jadhav, Priya Kadu, Revathi Shivakumar, Sachin Kolhatkar, Satyendra Rane, Shahed Pasha, Shreela Ghosh, Shubham Kesur, Sneha Nikam, Sumant Shetty, Sunil Vinekar, Surendra Jagtap, Ujwala Kumar, Vaishali Kanade and Vidhi Doshi.",Special Correspondent,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/sahayog-contemporary-art-exhibition-2022-provides-safe-platform-for-artists-young-and-senior/article64825426.ece
1135,"January 07, 2022",15:01 IST,entertainment,art,"‘Life is for celebration,’ says artist Rekha Rao"," Time and again artist Rekha Rao has emphasised that colour is her forte. Her upcoming exhibition in Bengaluru comprising a selection of her work over the past 10 years is testament to her ethos. “There are layers of colour in each of my paintings and at first glance, they may seem colourful. However, closer observation will show each painting does not have more than two main colours,” says Rekha Rao.  Curated by Renu George of Gallery Time & Space in Bengaluru, the 35 to 40 canvases, drawings and fine pen sketches on display have been inspired by various events and incidents from the artist’s life. Rekha, who shuttles between Bengaluru and Mumbai, says, “When I look at the canvas, something occurs in my mind and I begin to paint. I don’t plan the colours, I just think of the subject or a concept and then what happens, happens.” ”Poetry and literature inspire me nowadays and I believe that life is for celebration. If one were to look at all the bad things that are happening, one would only feel depressed.” Like her 2019 series titled, ‘Melancholy State of Happiness,’ Rekha says there is more to each canvas than meets the eye, in this show too. “At first glance, it may seem a bright, cheerful picture. But if you have the patience to look the piece closely, many ideas and thoughts come into your head which may not be all that pleasant.”  Rekha, who works primarily with acrylic and oils on canvas and high-quality paper, also dabbles in digital art. “Technology has opened up newer ways for artists to express themselves and it is exciting. But at the same time, working with canvas and paper has a charm of its own that technology cannot recreate — rather like writing by hand and keying into a computer. What is created on canvas cannot be replicated, even by the artist.” Hailing from a rich legacy of Indian art, Rekha who pursued art history at Elphinstone College in Mumbai says the Jahangir Art Gallery was a favourite haunt of hers as a student. “On many days after college, or sometimes even between classes, we would just go and sit in the gallery which was a prominent place for artists from all over India to come and exhibit their work in those days. By the end of four years, besides a degree in the History of Art, I had absorbed some of the best and most beautiful work of the time.”  “Today, my studio is filled with paintings and I am blessed to be able to spend my days with books, art and music.”  A solo show on the select works of Rekha Rao Hebbar will be on display at Gallery Time and Space from Jan 8 to 17, 2022.",Ruth Dhanaraj,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/life-is-for-celebration-says-artist-rekha-rao/article38166249.ece
1136,"January 07, 2022",10:40 IST,entertainment,art,Art of healing and hummingbirds," It’s Time to Heal, reads the title of Kadari Art Gallery’s new exhibition in Hyderabad. We might be staring at the third wave of COVID-19 in India while hoping that things do not get gloomy in the coming weeks, but the sight of the 100-plus watercolour paintings of hummingbirds at the gallery does have a calming effect. Artist Rasika Reddy began working on the series in the early stages of the pandemic, to take her mind off the uncertainty and gloom all around. “We were all at home figuring out what to do, beyond the regular activities of cooking and cleaning. A sense of helplessness set in as the pandemic raged on in New York,” recalls Rasika Reddy, the Hyderabad artist who now resides in the USA.  She picked up her brushes and drew a bird, then two, and enjoyed the process. She read up about birds and was intrigued by hummingbirds: “The birds are adaptable [and their music is] known to be healing and joyful - the attributes we need to go through the pandemic.” She had earlier worked with media ranging from oils to acrylic but chose watercolours for this series. In the early stages of lockdown when the supply chain for non-essentials was briefly hit, she borrowed colours and brushes from her granddaughter’s colouring kit and began painting, until she could get her own tools. Rasika painted hummingbirds and shared them on Instagram. “I have never been too active on social media, but I took to it since that was the only way to reach out.” The feedback she received spurred her on to paint more.  Soon, she was painting a bird a day. “The idea behind the series was nothing earthshaking; it was intended to put a smile on the face of the viewer. I painted around 240 birds and intend to do more. There are nearly 350 species of hummingbirds.” Some of the paintings focus solely on the birds framed against a white background, while others place them on a branch of a tree or amid the foliage. Rasika wanted nature-identical hues and experimented by mixing and matching colours. “The colours of the birds and their surroundings are ridiculously beautiful. Each day, as I painted, I noticed that it was also a source of joy to my family.”  Initially, she found herself on a learning curve with watercolours. “The technique used to highlight something is different from that of acrylic. While we paint a few layers to highlight something in acrylic, for watercolour, we darken the surroundings of the area we want to highlight. I learnt this from my son who is an amateur painter.”  Rasika did her masters in philosophy from the University of Hyderabad and moved to the US. She pursued arts at Brooklands College and West Surrey University for Art and Design when she lived in the UK intermittently. In her earlier series, she has explored themes inspired by Indian culture, gender and karma using different media and techniques and states that the commonality would be the meditative quality of her work. The hummingbird series, too, she reckons, had a prayer-like and meditative effect on her.

1137,"January 04, 2022",15:29 IST,entertainment,art,Artists bring early memories of the pandemic and more to fore," Artist Raka Panda’s paintings, titled Landscape, are not an artistic impression of a breathtaking landscape. Instead, depicted are a nameless and faceless sea of people seated together or standing by, not knowing when or how they will reach home. The memories of India’s first lockdown in March 2020 come rushing back as one views Panda’s artworks at Hyderabad’s Kalakriti Art Gallery’s ongoing exhibition titled Myth, Memory & Marvellous Realities. With artists Amit Lodh, Balaji Ponna, Biplab Sarkar, Kiyomi Talaulicar, Laxmipriya Panigrahi, Muktinath Mondal and Vijay Kumar, Panda focuses on the fluidity of memory and how it morphs to create new narratives. The memories of the first stage of the pandemic apart, artists draw from the unhurried lifestyles in their hometowns, kitschy and comic book colours of day-to-day life, nature in its pristine beauty and transform them into figurative and abstract artworks.  In a minimalistic manner, Kiyomi Talaulicar directs our attention to our dependency on masks and the faith reimposed by a handshake, which has become elusive in the age of social distancing. Artist Biplab Sarkar’s ‘Mirror of Small Things’ presents images of men, women and children during the pandemic — people walking home, frontline workers geared up for their tasks, or a photographer capturing every mood. Sarkar also comments on the plight of the airline industry in uncertain times and how life has turned into a hazy, brooding mass of black and grey. While memories of COVID-19 drive the narrative in some of the paintings, others look at nature and lifestyles. Laxmipriya Panigrahi’s watercolour series, This is Vitality, portrays wilderness and wildlife in all its glory, with a play of light, shade and an eye for minute details. Amit Lodh’s series has a comic book-like quality as it celebrates different facets of life in vivid hues.   The visual experimentation is also evident in the gallery’s other exhibition, Lost & Found: A Visual Journey, that features works of Claire Iono, Dhruti Mahajan, Ishrath Humairah and Karishma Wadhwa, often veering towards abstractions. These artists explore geometric abstraction as they play with myriad textures, colours and forms that are vastly different but seem to be in harmony on their canvases. Humairah’s palette varies from the burnt orange of sunsets to emerald greens and grey-blacks, with the landscapes creating a moody atmosphere. Wadhwa’s multi-textured paintings, despite their abstraction, can represent a sea of humanity. Mahajan experiments with geometrical forms while Claire Lono uses abstract landscapes to create surreal passages of time.

1138,"December 31, 2021",13:58 IST,entertainment,art,How going digital and increased community engagement helped Indian museums adapt to the new normal," Open since May 2021, the Kerala Museum, one of the oldest in Kochi, located amid greenery in the heart of Edappally, has become increasingly busy during weekends. “With almost two years of being cooped up indoors, glued to their screens, visitors seem to like the idea of being back in a green, open space, where they can take in the quietude and bring children too,” says Aditi Nayar, the museum’s director. (Sign up to our Technology newsletter, Today’s Cache, for insights on emerging themes at the intersection of technology, business and policy. Click here to subscribe for free.) Things, however, seem how they used to be. COVID had devastating consequences for museums. Footfalls vanished, revenues plunged, and even the well-funded ones had to slash their payroll. But it also has forced museums to rethink their fundamental purpose and identity. ‘What should a museum be in the post-pandemic world?’ is a question that museum directors across the world ponder on. It has been a few months since museums have reopened in India. Two key things that have helped them adapt to the post-pandemic world are having a strong digital presence and increased community engagement. 
Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya museum in Mumbai Spread over three buildings with 39 galleries, an in-person tour of the Salar Jung Museum in Hyderabad takes about half a day. But now, you need not even be in Hyderabad to view its vast collection. As of July this year, the museum has digitised more than 47,000 of its artefacts. On October 18, it launched an audio-guide app that invites a plug-and-play approach to a more physically-distanced tour. It partnered with Google Arts and Culture to showcase its prominent setup such as the interactive dissection of Raja Ravi Varma’s ‘Disappointed’ and a comprehensive breakdown of ‘Indian Epics in Art’, comprising folk images from the Chitrakathi tradition of Paithan, Maharashtra. 
HYDERABAD, 31/03/2012: The Salar Jung Museum is an art museum located on the southern bank of the Musi river in the city of Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India. It is one of the three National Museums of India. It has a collection of sculptures, paintings, carvings, textiles, manuscripts, ceramics, metallic artefacts, carpets, clocks, and furniture from Japan, China, Burma, Nepal, India, Persia, Egypt, Europe, and North America. The museums collection was sourced from the property of the Salar Jung family. The Salarjung Museum is the third largest museum in India housing the biggest one-man collections of antiques in the world. PHOTO: M_SUBHASH. Salar Jung was not the only museum to collaborate with Google Arts and Culture. The Museum of Art and Photography (MAP) in Bengaluru, for instance, has 12 exhibits. Though MAP’s launch was deferred to 2022, it has been hosting a slew of online events over the last two years.  Indian Music Experience (IME), another museum in Bengaluru, meanwhile, has three online exhibitions on Google Arts and Culture, including one dedicated to the late sitar legend Ravi Shankar on his 100th birth anniversary last year.

Amid Coronavirus lockdown, how museums are sprucing up their collections and keeping history virtually alive Starting from ‘Birdsong’, which will be IME’s first physical exhibition in 2022, every exhibition the museum organises will also be available online, promises its director Manasi Prasad. Exhibitions apart, IME also had classes, concerts, workshops and talks online. Though their online programming started well, the audience for concerts and workshops declined this year, probably due to screen fatigue. Despite this, IME plans to continue its online offerings. “People don’t log into an event while it’s happening. But they watch it later. [These videos] are resources they can refer to whenever they want,” says Manasi. The following for IME’s social media pages grew by over 50% during the pandemic. Since the pandemic, Manasi says, IME has been increasingly observing and engaging with its online audience. “Whatever exhibits we did were confined to people who visited IME. But the idea of using online platforms to take the content to audiences everywhere is something that we learned during the pandemic.“ The Kerala Museum in Kochi is currently digitising its art collection. The exhibits will go online by the end of January 2022. Descriptions of the original works of art will be available for public viewing, along with curated stories of each of the 200 artworks on display. “As of now, we are exploring a hybrid space, where the physical and the digital meet,” she adds. This is the route all the museums we spoke to seem to be taking. “All the well-funded museums are strengthening their digital presence. They are shifting most of their exhibitions online. This would not have happened or would have happened very slowly without the pandemic,” says Reena Dewan, the former president of the International Council for Museums (ICOM) India and the director of Kolkata Centre for Creativity (KCC). Museums are starting to realise the significance of community engagement upon resumption after lockdowns. From being exclusionary spaces involving people from the art community and academia, they are opening up for participation from the public.  IME, for instance, hosted a free open-mic during this year’s Navaratri wherein anyone from the public could perform. This is just a small example of their long-term community engagement plan. IME has partnered with the British Council to create a series of youth engagement initiatives. The museum has a Youth Advisory Board, wherein teenagers participate in the decision-making. This board advises the museum on how to improve its programming. One of its suggestions, for instance, is to do something on K-Pop. Adopting art As a part of its Project Svaritha, IME introduces its vast music resources to children with neurodiverse needs and those from socially disadvantaged backgrounds. Its Future Museum Professionals Internship program trains six interns in curation, design, and development of an online platform. “The idea is just to make the space more inclusive,” says Manasi. The Kerala government is promoting a movement to make museums function as interactive spaces for the youth. Keralam Museum, an organisation formed to build and modernise museums, has realised 11 of the 31 projects it initiated. “While well-funded museums, state- and private-owned, are burgeoning their digital presence and implementing community outreach plans, many small museums struggle for survival, says Reena. This is where collaborations helped. During the World Heritage Week between November 19 to 25, for instance, KCC in collaboration with Paschimbanga Sangrahalaya Samiti organised the Cluster of Museums Exhibitions. The programme aimed to reimagine the future of museums through discussions, exhibitions, performances, workshops and film screenings over the week.  “We invited 16 museums from Bengal, including the small ones. Usually, these small autonomous museums are reluctant to be a part of such events. But thanks to COVID, they were more open to collaboration and networking,” adds Reena, “And it created a ripple effect. Now, people in Gujarat and Jammu University also want to host these kinds of events involving the smaller museums.” Museums are no more mere spaces for exhibition and performance. As they adapt to the new normal, they find it necessary to talk to the community and talk to each other. The pandemic has also nudged people to look at these cultural spaces with renewed appreciation. Despite the slow recovery in revenue, the museum directors we spoke to said people’s need to experience art and culture in a physical space has only increased. Culture is as important as health,” says Sabyasachi. “If you ignore culture, you are ignoring a significant part of being human. Because culture is what injects sense and sensibilities within a person.”  (

According to Myna, the developments in 2021 ranged from artists producing more, growth of a new art market, the impact of technology on art to pandemic-related visualisation in artworks.   “The pandemic brought people across the globe closer emotionally; we are facing a common enemy. People supported the artists in many ways and that is reflected in the art market,” she says adding that Sotheby’s recently surpassed its previous auction prices and declared NFT (non-fungible token) sales had reached $100 million in 2021. “This is true for the domestic art market too.” India can look forward to the country’s first NFT auction (by an Indian auction house rather than an NFT marketplace) to be conducted by Mumbai-based Prinseps in January 2022. It will not only be testing the market but also make more collectors familiar with the metaverse. The auction will include works of Gobardhan Ash from the 1950s; a buyer can buy either a physical version or an NFT of the same work. Closer home, Lokame Tharavadu (The World Is One) at Alappuzha in Kerala marked a determined resolve to return to the physical art show. One of the first and the largest exhibitions in the world to be staged physically in 2021, it managed to operate smoothly within COVID-19 protocols.   Also Read |
How India’s artist community collaborated offline to empower the industry during the pandemic Spread out over seven venues in the seaside town, it overcame several hiccups such as the sudden change of launch dates due to the imposition of lockdown and delay in arrival of art works. It showcased 3,000 works of 267 artists from Kerala.   The one positive that emerged from the pandemic, says curator Bose Krishnamachari, is “a realisation of how important IRL (in real life) art experiences are. Physicality is one of the most important elements of visual art.”  He points out that before digital technology came into the picture over the last 30 years or so, people experienced art physically and in person. “Today audiences have a range of tools and mediums with which they can access exhibitions and artworks but there is nothing like being in the physical presence of people and art works. That is why the public have been flocking to ‘Lokame Tharavadu’. I hope it becomes a regular feature in the Alappuzha cultural scene.” For artist NS Harsha, such physical exhibitions are a good example of the collective human pursuit to ‘face’ the given situation and react. “Now that the world has experienced the levels of isolation, I hope we start valuing the preciousness of physical interactions even more now.”  2021 was a year when love and friendship were rediscovered and sought out like never before. This is the underlying theme of ‘This is Why we cannot title an exhibition after Love’, a show by artist and curator Prabhakar Kamble in Mumbai’s Gallery Art & Soul. “We realised what we lost in the pandemic and what we desire the most in life: love and friendship. It was found when people were in trouble,” says Prabhakar who organised the supply of art materials and goods to artists holed up in their homes in rural Maharashtra and Mumbai.  Last year, Prabhakar had evocatively presented the dire condition of migrants, in an online show called Broken Foot at Mojarto.com. “Compared to 2020,” he says, “there is more optimism in 2021.”  Also Read |
How the Spanish-made Covid Art Museum conveys the emotive consequences of the pandemic  The fears triggered by the spread of the coronavirus wracked Mumbai-based artist Lakshmi Madhavan. Her questions, “Will I ever see my grandmother again? Is it safe to visit her?” resulted in ‘Hanging by a Thread’ (
Ammammayude Mundu Veshti ), an installation that invokes her deep connect with the traditional hand-woven cream and gold fabric of Kerala that her grandmother wears.
   On show at Port Museum, one of the venues of
Lokame Tharavadu, the installation is a significant indicator of how much COVID-19  seeped into the artist’s expressions. “All of us experienced the pandemic in one way or another. The stimulus may not have crept in very obviously but it definitely was present at a subliminal level,” says Lakshmi pointing to the fact that artists worked on smaller canvases, as many were not working from studios.
 Harsha believes that the response to a given life situation is subjective. “One can bring in the images offered by living experiences or consciously turn away to look at a flower. Even the gesture of turning away is an artistic statement, isn’t it?” “Since Christie’s auction earlier this year made headline news, there has been an approximated $2.5 billion worth of NFTs (non-fungible tokens) that have been bought and sold,” says Ameya Dias who leads an art consultancy firm based in Mumbai. “In comparison, the current activity is limited and though there are some front runners such as Nature Morte gallery and Prinseps auction house, the overall market in India is just about starting to get familiar with the concept of NFTs.”   Also Read |
How NFT art has evolved the role of the ‘artist’  Lakshmi’s ‘See, Saw, Seen’, a work on show at Kashi Art Café in Fort Kochi, was created for the Kochi Art Week, organised by the Kochi Biennale Foundation. Six of the 47 frames were digital works for the NFT market.  Lakshmi says, she opted for digital art because of the hours she spends before the screen. “One can experience my work even without coming in front of it. Now there is talk of Metaverse; technology will allow us to experience snow in a hot clime. Art has to adapt.”   In the future, she feels, the art world will operate on a hybrid model. “NFT is there. We have the economics of it; the paintings are selling,” says Lakshmi. A positive aspect of NFT, she says, is democratisation of art. “High-end art can have a lot of gatekeeping but, when it comes to NFT, it is more transparent and the artist gains with every sale.”  Also Read |
Keen on going into NFT art? Here’s what you should know, according to the experts Artist Joseph Chakola, who minted a few NFTs, says the second lockdown saw NFT being hotly discussed in Clubhouse internationally. “A group called NFT Malayali was born out of it.” Explaining it as a proof of ownership of a digital asset, he adds, “Though these are still early days, it is definitely going to be a significant part of the art world from now on.”  Anantha Nadamel, who
founded NFT Malayali in April 2021 , says it was formed mainly to educate artists about this new mode of transaction. He sold his first art work for 0.165 Eth (Ethereum) and now commands a floor price of 1 Eth (approximately ₹3 lakh.)

1140,"December 24, 2021",22:17 IST,entertainment,art,To ‘disrupt and discover’ like Satish Gujral," The world knows Satish Gujral (25 December 1925 - 26 March 2020) as the acclaimed muralist, sculptor and architect but to me, he was a truly expressive father. He would hug and kiss his children, his smile telling us that we were his universe. He was the quintessential storyteller too and would never tire of telling stories of life in Mexico (where he trained with the radical Mexican muralist, Diego Rivera), the beauty of Jhelum river, the camaraderie at his art college in Mumbai.  My earliest memory is of him driving his Fiat, with me on his lap. We would be going to my mother’s pottery factory in Okhla where he was working on his famed mural for the Baroda House. Once there, I would be left alone to play with the clay, spin away at the potter’s wheel. We were living then in Tilak Marg in a typical Lutyen Delhi bungalow allocated to him by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, in recognition of his art. It was a typical
sarkari house and my father had converted the garage into his studio. Palettes, rows of easels and many tables decked with murals filled this space. There was also this drum of oil, which became my throne each afternoon. Soon after school, I would rush home, parking myself next to him to observe him work. The deal was that I had to remain quiet, so we spoke with our silence. Mohit and Alpana, my elder siblings, were both away at boarding school and I grew up almost like an only child, my father’s constant companion.
  Our home was a melting pot. where culturally cognizant people of all creative dispositions would meet. From dancer Indrani and her architect husband, Habib Rehman to cultural activist Pupul Jayakar. Modernist Krishen Khanna would be in and out of the house. The art scene was less pocketed and much less competitive. Ideas flowed freely, as did opinions. His contemporaries, who would later be called the Bombay Boys, M F Husain, G R Santosh and SH Raza, would share their journeys with each other. My parents hosted gala parties and were like beacons to free-flowing thinkers. Their home in Pakistan always filled with freedom fighters, poets, authors and activists. Father would be moist-eyed when he recalled how he swam the breadth of the fast-flowing Jhelum river as a child. How his elder brother and former PM of India, I K Gujral, joined their father in the freedom movement. He often spoke of his closeness with painter Frida Kahlo, who became his best friend in Mexico. My biggest art acquisition from his work is also an accidental one. It is called Nancy and is a very muscular, pronounced portrait of his American girlfriend in Mexico who, in reality, was a stunning blonde with blue eyes. I discovered it when sorting the storehouse within the studio and was so enchanted that I told my mother I was hanging it in my bedroom. It was the first interior space I ever designed.  That was a much simpler world where artists were truly absorbed in their art, not the fruits of their success. From him I learnt not to allow success to limit my creative flow, which would make me repeatedly go to what ‘worked’. Instead, he asked us to explore, let the mind roam free, disrupt, discover and keep tampering with success. He had an indirect way of influencing all of us through example. My father was the axis around which our world spun. His work extended to multiple disciplines, and when he turned to architecture, our dining table would have all his architectural models parked on them. While the world marvelled at his projects like the Belgian Embassy or the UNESCO building, I discovered his mastery over scale only recently when I visited Ambedkar Bhavan in Lucknow, a bit bastardised now by the Government’s ghetto style. There was much happening in our house, so many mediums - wood, metal, canvas, burnt wood - being explored. The only religion practised was art and the only way to think was creative. My parents were one unit and my mother, his bridge to the world. They did everything together and shared this extremely close and also volatile relationship. Right till the end. She would interpret for him at each meeting. He, as we know, had lost his hearing as a child and ASL was not part of the pre-Partition world. Hence his family developed their own means of communicating with him, a vocabulary my mother elaborated further. I call it my father tongue!

I was filled with a sense of wonder at the beauty all around me. There was no electricity and throughout the day, especially at night we could hear the sounds of forest creatures. Those memories and that sense of nature is what I try to capture in my work,” says Bengaluru-based artist, Ganapati Hegde, who hails from Kumta in coastal Karnataka. With Nature as his muse, Ganapati is known for the incandescence that marks most of his work. “Bird or beast, flora or fauna — they all find place in my art. It is our duty as human beings endowed with intelligence to protect these hidden treasures of nature and as an artist I depict them in my own way.” 
Artist Ganapati Hegde -- Special Arrangement In his bid to connect with nature, Ganapati juxtaposes the behavioural aspects of human beings with animal postures and characteristics. The artist says the series ‘Into the Forest’ which is currently on display in Bengaluru was created during the lockdown.  “There are two aspects to my work in this series — how we experience nature and how nature interacts with itself,” says the artist, adding, “For instance, my painting called ‘Love Play’ which depicts dragon flies mating shows how important the insect kingdom is for the future. If they are destroyed it will affect the food chain of all living species.” His piece, ‘Look at Me’ shows a frog looking at an iPad is similar to his other works depicting a chameleon on a sofa or a pig on a swing. “With these images I try to capture a feeling of laziness, isolation and daydreaming. It is a throwback to days when I had to stare at a screen while using a laptop for work.” 
'New Beginning' by Ganapati Hegde -- Special Arrangement Ganapti who worked on multimedia, animation and product design projects gave it up in 2018 to pursue his passion as a full-time artist. “My work is not satirical and I do not wish to offend anyone when I give my subjects a persona. It is purely a personal perspective of a person in front of an electronic device and I thought it may resonate with others.” “I use acrylic and oil, ink and colour pastels to achieve the combinations seen in this series.” With prices starting from ₹ 45,000, the 20-plus paintings in the series ‘Into the Forest’ by Ganapati Hedge are being showcased at KYNKYNY till Dec 31, 2021.",Ruth Dhanaraj,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/revel-in-the-beauty-of-forest-life-with-artist-ganapati-hegde/article38021265.ece
1142,"December 23, 2021",16:33 IST,entertainment,art,Twenty-two Korean and Indian artists present unusual mediums in this virtual art show," Choi Ji Young’s translucent canvases of people walking up an alleyway and waiting for the subway in an urban city setting leads this vast display. Click, zoom and scroll through adjacent walls to find surrounding works spanning mediums: from Korean rice paper to fabric and thread on canvas, there is a lot to see. In a virtual, pristine white, cursor-enabled “navigable” box, stand 22 such works — 11 from India, and 11 from Korea — by young, emerging artists. After a pandemic-induced break last year, this collaborative art show by InKo Centre in association with the Indian Art Museum in Seoul, titled Emerging Canvas is back for its seventh edition. Curated by Cupid Lee from Seoul and Vaishnavi Ramanathan from Chennai, the show had over 50 artists send in their portfolios. From this, 11 each were selected for the final display. The show that focusses on artists working with two-dimensional media (painting, drawing, printmaking and so on), attempts to identify talent that is yet to find a formal platform in the art world. There is no definitive running theme that ties the works together. But the spotlight was trained on “hopeful works” that look back on daily life lost because of the pandemic, or the dream of a bright future in an uneasy reality, says Cupid who curated the Korean section of the display.  Vaishnavi, who curated the Indian section of the exhibit, adds, “Both of us focussed on young emerging talent while taking into consideration the larger social, political and artistic backdrop against which they work.” The possibility of refreshing ideas is what Cupid was specifically looking for: “Art is always craving a fresh start,” she adds.   The collection is a mix of abstract, realist and surreal works. Gimesoo’s Forgotten World 1 catches attention with its dark blue and green tones, depicting a beautiful street view veiled in the night. A few canvases away is V Saranraj’s Oppari Singers’ Portraits — realistic etchings on the musical instrument,
parai . Whereas Sagar Naik Mule’s Mind Of My Father is an unusual portrait that uses river mud, red soil, fish scales, dry mushrooms and pen on paper as mediums.
 “Saranraj from Tamil Nadu captured my attention for the way he engages with the people he portrays in his work. I was also impressed by the way he uses materials and techniques that organically emerge from the life of the people he portrays, to convey a broader vision of humanity,” says Vaishnavi. Vishwanath Kuttum on the other hand connects present day incidents, both from everyday life and larger socio-political events, with his childhood in the Andaman Islands in his work. And, Bang Gyu Tae, an artist who overcame developmental disorders as a child, paints his world with simple yet bright colours on canvas. “Choi Ji Young, Lee Min Kyung, and Kang Jong Gil are also excellent young artists who received doctorate degrees from Hongik University, one of the best art universities in Korea,” says Cupid.  How did a completely virtual display affect the show’s curation? Cupid says that high definition photos are used for the show — “So you can check the details of works that cannot be seen with the naked eye. The virtual art museum lets you appreciate works without being restricted by time and region.” In a physical show one has to be mindful of whether the works can be transported easily or accommodated within the given space. “In an online show, there is considerable freedom with regard to these aspects,” Vaishnavi adds.

1143,"December 23, 2021",13:12 IST,entertainment,art,National Award-winning sculptor Maria Antony Raj on his work inspired by animal behaviour," A colony of ants is frozen in motion. They seem to trudge across a wall and around what appears to be three golden domes and work together, typical of their behaviour. But here, they are made of copper and brass.  National Award-winning artist Maria Antony Raj’s sculpture, titled Ants, says volumes about his preoccupation with natural phenomena that inspire human behaviour. Ants and his other sculptures that have been in the making for the last 15 years, now stand in DakshinaChitra Museum’s Kadambari Art Gallery for public viewing.  The artist, who resides and works from Cholamandal Artists’ Village, is a man of very few words. But his work speaks for itself.   A sense of fragility emanates from his sculptures that look closely at animal behaviour, that is often, unknowingly, mimicked by mankind. His fascination for anthills is what inspired him first to conjure up figures that resembled the shape, but comprising varying elements. “The ant has always been seen as a social role model to humans. From folk tales and proverbs to moral stories, the ant is portrayed as hardworking, honest and cooperative. Though small, the ant has succeeded,” says Maria. The way in which ants share food and work in union, is another metaphor that often presents itself in his work.   On the other hand, his series titled Butterfly features delicate, visual takes on how birds and insects interact with the
magarantham (pollen) in flowers. Entirely made with brass, copper sheets and wires, these are also mobile sculptures that Maria says “have just the right, subtle movement, but have not lost their form in the space.”
  Of late, the artist has been engaging a lot with mobile sculptures. “When the sculpture is kept at a fixed place, it seems to be still and aloof. I always think of ways to make it more communicative,” says Maria. Butterfly etches out an oft-seen scene at the park, of butterflies in pursuit of a flower to comfortably settle on. While the petals are done in brass sheets, the anther and pollen are made of copper wires. He says his “deep approach” towards such simple occurrences is what lends itself to a sculpture. And why does he stick to such themes? “Globalisation and the current struggle to retain cultural values, leads me to keep it simple.”  Butterfly:an essential of life
 is on display at DakshinaChitra Museum’s Kadambari Art Gallery till January 30. ",Gowri S,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/maria-antony-raj-on-his-award-winning-sculpture/article38018960.ece
1144,"December 21, 2021",21:50 IST,entertainment,art,Ahmedabad-based artist-designer duo interprets emotions on rock for ‘Design Miami’," What happens when rocks get emotional? Ahmedabad-based Apical Reforms Studio explores this idea in its art installation exhibited at the 17th edition of “ Design Miami”, held recently at Miami Beach, USA. The only Indian design studio to showcase its works at the art-design fair this year, artists and co-founders of Apical Reform, Darshan Soni and Amrish Patel say the event was an opportunity to understand and appreciate global design trends.  Design Miami, an annual design fair held in Miami, Florida, exhibits works of collectors, gallerists, designers, curators, and critics from around the world. The idea of the fair is to celebrate design culture and commerce by collecting, exhibiting, discussing, and creating collectible designs at the venue. Featuring over 35 gallery and curio exhibits, the theme for this year’s exhibits was ‘Human Kind’. Some of the artists featured at the show are British visual artist David Shrigley, American multimedia artist Alex Israel and British painter Jadé Fadojutimi, and New York-based artist and sculptor Hugh Hayden.  “Our work, ‘Emotional Rocks’ interprets intangible emotions on hard objects. Emotions are forces capable of impacting individual or collective lives. They provide a sense of quality and meaning to existence. This art installation perceives emotions as powerful forces that can soften even the toughest,” says Darshan, who is also an architect.  Conceived and executed by Darshan and Amrish, the work comprises benches with reflective surfaces and glossy pebble-like forms, some of which seem to be melting. “As artists, we have tried to express these collective emotions through ‘Emotional Rocks’. How we as humans are constantly changing and how our perspective of life is changing,” Darshan adds.  Collectible design often combines art and functionality. “Occupying a tenuous space between fine art and day-to-day activities, functional art refers to aesthetic objects that serve utilitarian purposes. This genre is remarkably inclusive; it encompasses everything from furniture, lighting, staircases, to a lot more. Through a thorough understanding of materials, environment and purpose, amalgamated with sound aesthetic sensibilities, we have designed works that are pleasing, comforting and efficient in their function,” says Darshan. While the design culture, on a global level, is tapping into technological advancement and material exploration, India still has a long way to go, observes Darshan. “The design environment is evolving in India. The internet has made it easy to reach, learn, and be aware of what is happening worldwide. But many more materials and technologies are not yet accessible to designers in India,” he adds. Apical Reform is gearing to showcase its kinetic artworks in Geneva early next year. It would also showcase one of its functional artworks in Paris, which will continue in Japan for another nine months at three different locations.

1146,"December 20, 2021",14:01 IST,entertainment,art,Madhukar Mucharla and Jayeeta Chatterjee expanding their definitions of art,"  Exploring identity and keeping alive traditional crafts are elements that bind young artists Madhukar Mucharla and Jayeeta Chatterjee, both pursuing their residency programmes at artist Chippa Sudhakar’s Banyan Hearts Studios (BHS) in Hyderabad. The two artists in conversation with
The Hindu MetroPlus:  Leather as a medium of expression Currently pursuing his residency programme at Banyan Hearts Studios, Madhukar is one of the emerging artists to watch out for in Hyderabad’s art firmament. The innate truth in Madhukar’s works emerges not only through his choice of material but also from the issues he addresses. Using leather as a medium of expression, he tells stories that reflect the inequalities around marginalised communities. Sewing leather which is at the core of his art practice is deeply personal for Madhukar who grew up watching his father make leather products and footwear in his village Nandiwanaparthy near Hyderabad. With leather being at the centre of his ancestors’ occupation, he had pondered, since childhood, on the reality of unequal lives.   After completing his BFA degree from Potti Sriramulu Telugu University, he pursued the MFA from Jawaharlal Nehru Architecture and Fine Arts University (JNAFAU). It was then that his organic interest in art led to a project — for his Masters course — on people who work with leather. “I did some experiments and wondered why not create contemporary works with leather. I hoped to make my art speak for the Dalits,” he says.  An invitation to participate in the Kochi-Muziris Biennale in 2018 helped him find own his cultural identity as he was encouraged to go back to his roots, understand his family history, why and how leather was used by his ancestors and how society treated leather workers as they were traditionally considered impure. He shares the impact: “Knowing my ancestors led me to Dalit history.” His 18 works at BHS, including portraits, give voice to the oppressed people, migrant labour, manual scavengers and social reformers.  At his workspace, Madhukar has a cane ladder and sheets of leather in different tones, sourced from Chittempad in Telangana. He first draws figures on the floor, spreads leather pieces on it, then climbs the ladder to check the visual. If he is satisfied, he proceeds to cut patterns on leather and stitch them.   He celebrates the lives of Ambedkar and Jyoti Rao Phule with his leather portraits. In the ‘
101 kobbarikayalu  (coconuts)’ installation, he has used poster glue to create the fibrous white kernel and outer coat in leather. “Politicians often vow to break 101 coconuts to god if they come to power. No matter who wins, the status of the poor doesn’t change,” he says of the work.
 Madhukar hopes to go to Baroda to hone his artistic skill. “My father feels proud when he sees me create art with leather. He asks, ‘making footwear is itself tough but how are you able to create such big works?’ It’s a proud moment for me,” he smiles. Homemakers’ identity   With teacher parents, Jayeeta Chatterjee from Kolkata is the first artist in the family. Having done her first residency from Khoj in Delhi, BHS is her second internship. “There is some special connection between wood and me,” says Jayeeta experimenting with
 nakshi kantha  stitching on woodcut print on cloth. Her present works from the Homemaker series began when she lived alone while pursuing her Masters in Baroda. “I was missing my family and experienced loneliness. As I had to manage the chores too, I began valuing the work done by my mother,” she says.
 
Jayeeta also pondered on the role of a homemaker in the family and began to document homemakers in Baroda. When she went back home, she would document the lives of homemakers living in Bolpur near Santiniketan. “Homemakers work 24/7 but they are not recognised; I want to explore their identity and tell stories through my compositions and stitchings,” she says.
   Jayeeta’s main project is to revive the
nakshi kantha  work, the dying craft of the Bengali traditional stitching technique. She began to research it after learning the technique from the women of Mahadipur, Loharpur and Malda. “The
 nakshi kantha  designs are being used commercially on saris and
kurtis but originally these designs were done on a quilt and would take six months to complete depending on the pattern. Soft fabric is a prerequisite for the design. But I found women recycling saris and dhotis to do the designs during weddings.”
 After her residency in Hyderabad, Jayeeta plans to continue her creative engagements in Baroda.", Neeraja Murthy,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/madhukar-mucharla-and-jayeeta-chatterjee-at-banyan-hearts-studios-bhs-expand-definitions-of-art/article37995754.ece

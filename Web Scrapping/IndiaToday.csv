It is being viewed as part of the party's strategy to counter AAP. The BJP and Congress leadership have already downplayed the AAP impact in this hill state.Desperate to return to power, the Congress leadership in Himachal has also been confirmed to pull its socks after the AAP started poaching its leaders.

However, the recent developments point out that breaking the decade-old tradition of not letting any party repeat the government besides attracting the people of this state will be an uphill task for AAP, which lacks a credible state domicile face.""These people (BJP) are not afraid of me but the people. Dear BJP leaders, there was no need to replace the chief minister and to touch the feet of tainted leaders of other parties had you walked honestly for the people. People are trusting AAP, which will give an honest and patriotic government to Himachal,” Arvind Kejriwal said in a tweet on Saturday.Interestingly, Arvind Kejriwal used the word 'patriotic government' in his tweets after the BJP leaders accused AAP of hobnobbing with Khalistani elements.The development comes after Himachal refused entry to Punjab vehicles carrying the stickers of Khalistani flags and photos of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. Congress also organised a Tiranga Yatra in Shimla to oppose AAP's entry.The state-based psephologists are also of the opinion that the state has less floating vote share as compared to neighbouring Punjab.

At present, there is a shortfall of 1,500 MW in power demand and supply.The issue was discussed in the cabinet meeting to ensure that there is no load shedding in the state and 24 hours power supply. The state cabinet has approved the purchase of electricity. It will be available at a lower rate than the center rates.This decision will cost Rs 100 to Rs 150 crore rupees. Last year, the expenditure was Rs 192 crore.Raut said authorities are working everywhere in the country to get coal. The country's coal minister and energy department are working together with us.Coal reserves, on the other hand, are declining as demand for electricity increases. Sometimes railway tracks are not available for coal. Only 17 TMC of water is available in Koyna. Electricity costs ten to twelve rupees. But now there is no electricity in the market. In Gujarat, power is cut off one day a week, Raut said.Raut said that the state had signed an agreement with the company for 700 MW at Rs 5 per unit.Energy Minister Nitin Raut added said that the heat wave is in the state, due to which the transformers are failing due to rising heat in it. Now, when there is a power crisis, it has to be taken from private companies.Nitin Raut said that the extra power that is needed now has to be taken from private companies during the power crisis. Now there is a shortage of coal.The contract was signed in 2007 at a cost of three and a half rupees. The Center has set a rate of Rs 12. ""You can buy 50 percent more than that,"" Raut said.",Mustafa Shaikh,https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/maharashtra-govt-to-purchase-power-from-private-players-1935177-2022-04-08

59,"April 8, 2022",18:39 IST,India, ,Gorakhnath temple attacker can be part of larger conspiracy hatched by ‘virtual plotters’: Former Lt Gen,"A man wielding a sickle and chasing cops outside the Gorakhnath temple in Uttar Pradesh sent shockwaves through the country. The attack has striking similarities with the terror modules of Hezbollah and HAMAS of the middle-east, according to experts, who say that such terror attacks, using knifes, are common in Israel.However, Lieutenant General Abhay Krishna (Retd.), former General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the southwestern, eastern and central commands of the Indian Army, says that it is too early to trace this attack back to such modules in the middle-east. It also cannot be ruled out as a future trend by terrorist organizations, he added.“There may be a possibility that the individual may have been radicalised or recruited online, like digital recruitment done by ISIS or Hezbollah. The accused, Ahmad Murtaza Abbasi, could be a potential target of these terrorist organisations for several reasons. Recruits termed as “virtual entrepreneurs” or “virtual plotters” are recruited online by terrorist organisations through social media platforms and are incited, funded and possibly trained remotely for terror acts,” Lt Gen Krishna told India Today TV.Also Read: | Gorakhnath temple attacker was honey-trapped into aiding IS, say police“There might be a possibility that other vulnerable and educated youths are also being recruited online by terrorist organisations to carry out attacks on other possible targets similar to what is being done by Hezbollah in Israel. After further facts and linkages are brought to the fore by investigating agencies and after a follow-up trend of such incidents, more convincing opinions could be formed. As of now, it has come to light in the preliminary reports that the culprit was influenced by banned Islamic preacher Zakir Naik and has a possible link to ISIS. This incident could be one of the stray incidents in the wake of an outburst of one of the communities on the Hijab issue and “The Kashmir Files”,” he added.The background of the attacker stunned investigators that an IIT graduate, with a brilliant mind, can be so radicalised.“An educated person is the most vulnerable to mental steering if explained with logic or if his perspective about things, including any ideology, is influenced. Therefore, the doctrine followed to get these vulnerable and educated young people may be to first identify them, then use social media platforms to establish contact with such individuals, followed by forging of nascent relationships and religious indoctrination,” the army man said.Also Read: | UP govt terms attack on cops at Gorakhnath temple an 'act of terror'“Then comes communication with prospective recruits via email and sending instructions on how to use encrypted communication platforms, including encrypted mail and instructions to minimise detection. A sleeper cell is formed by recruiting trusted and committed individuals. Potential targets, with political and religious prominence, are put under surveillance. One can presume that the Gorakhnath temple was chosen because the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh is also the chief priest of the temple and because of the role he played in the Ram Mandir case. A significant sum of money is also promised to online recruits and transferred beforehand or after committing the terror act,” he added.The attack also raised questions about the training of the policemen, especially at constable levels, who are deployed at such crucial places.“The police should incorporate adequate expertise, infrastructure and training of its personnel in the cyber and information warfare domain to tackle such attackers. Close coordination with sister intelligence agencies is also a must to thwart the online recruitment activities of terrorist organisations through social media platforms. Therefore, one can assume that presently the Indian police forces do not appear to be adequately trained to handle such violence due to inappropriate equipment, procedures and training. There is also a supposed communication gap and non-synergy among organisations dealing with terrorism,” Lt. Gen Krishna (Retd.) said.“Moreover, such attacks are bound to succeed initially due to the surprise factor. However, the overall damage remains restricted due to the use of crude weapons. India’s ‘no free gun’ policy will definitely help in keeping such incidents localised and restrict the scale of damage,” he added.Also Read: | Gorakhnath temple attacker says he was angry over 'CAA, NRC, atrocities against Muslims'",Abhishek Anand,https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/gorakhnath-temple-attacker-may-have-been-a-hezbollah-recruit-retired-army-man-1935141-2022-04-08

This was after the CBDT chairman, in his deposition, informed the Public Accounts Committee or PAC that of the 59,707 returns of more than Rs 10 lakh among total of 21,55,368 cases, only 3,379 cases were chosen for assessment and scrutiny.The Income tax department told the committee that due to shortage of manpower to check 100 percent such cases in all Commissionerates, where agricultural income claimed is above Rs 10 lakh, the Finance Ministry has devised its own mechanism for picking up cases for scrutiny due to paucity of manpower to handle the same.A system may be designed to examine the 3,379 cases with due promptitude and based on these assessments, new scenarios may be included in the Computer Aided Scrutiny Selection (CASS) for refining the process of selection of cases for scrutiny.The Committee in its report titled ""Assessment Relating to Agricultural Income has flagged that the 3,379 cases chosen by CBDT includes cases of taxpayers reporting agricultural income less than Rs 10 lakh while focus of scrutiny should be on assessees reporting higher agricultural income.The Committee has recommended that the Ministry should consider devising a mechanism for categorisation of cases of agricultural income in three slabs i.e. above Rs 10 lakh, Rs 50 lakh and Rs l crore in CASS so as to better target high evasion risk cases.In its report the committee said, ""Such a measure will also facilitate scrutiny of different types of agriculturists with the limited resources available with the Ministry/CBDT and enable in preventing possible leakage of revenue.""The public accounts committee headed by Congress Member of Parliament (MP) Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury noted that the number of cases reporting high agricultural income is significant.The Government informed the panel that the number of ""cases selected for scrutiny is fine tuned with a view to striking a balance between available resources and various types of risk (which requires investigation) through Computer Aided Scrutiny Selection (CASS)."" The CASS is a centralised system for selection of cases of scrutiny based on information in Income Tax Return (ITR), IT forms, TDS/TCS, data as reported by third parties, data received through inter-departmental MoUs etc.The Committee has noted that a major chunk of agriculturists are reluctant to file income tax returns due to practical difficulties arising out of lack of awareness, frequency of going to IT Office and connectivity issues faced by farmers to travel to the Income Tax office.The panel In its report submitted on Tuesday said, ""This has resulted in non-availability of crucial information pertaining to agricultural production, land records etc. for the ITD database. There are also apprehensions of farmers that inclusion of their personal information in the Income Tax Database may disqualify them from accessing various welfare schemes of the Government.""The Committee opined that if data of agriculturists is included in ITD Database, it will aid in not only widening the tax base but also enable better monitoring and detection of cases of money laundering.The Committee takes note of Audit scrutiny based on a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed in the Patna High Court. Following the PIL, the Tax Department had initiated verification of returns in cases where assessees had returned income of more than Rs 1 crore from Agriculture.The Directorate of Income Tax (Systems) instructed its units to send Status Reports for the High Court after examination of aspects such as whether tax payer may have made a data entry error while filling up the return.The DGIT (Systems) then had identified 2,746 cases of agricultural income above Rs 1 crore in the ITRs of the assessment years 2007-08 to 2014-15. The assessment officers or AOs were instructed to verify the claims of exemption on agricultural income in such ITRs.The Committee flagged that out of 136 Principal Chief Commissioner of Income Tax selected by Audit where status reports furnished to DGIT (systems) were sought, only 26 in ten states furnished the status reports to Audit. The Committee in its report has highlighted that the Comptroller and Auditor General of India conducts the audit of receipts of the Union Government under Section 16 of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971 and non-furnishing of required details to audit is a serious lapse and needs to be looked into thoroughly.The PAC is one of the most powerful Parliamentary panels which scrutinises the audit reports of government revenue earning and spending activities created by the CAG.The pac has said that C&AG Report No. 9 of 2019 for the year that ended on March 2018 contains significant results of the compliance audit of the Department of Revenue- Direct Taxes of the Union Government and Chapter V of the Report deals with ""Assessments relating to Agricultural income.""Public Accounts Committee, decided to examine parts the CAG report pertaining to the ""Exemption without verification of supporting documents, Incorrect reflection of agricultural income in ITD Database, Status of Verification by the Department: and Compliance issues - Mistakes in Assessments.The PAC in its report has flagged serious concerns over the low levels of scrutiny and verification of ""agricultural income"" claims filed by tax payers which could be leading to evasion of taxes via utilisation of the exemption enjoyed by certain categories of agricultural income. As per section 2(IA) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (the Act) 'agricultural income' means (a) Any rent or revenue derived from land which is situated in India and is used for agricultural purposely (b) Any income derived from such land by agricultural operations including processing of agricultural produce so as to render it fit for market or sale of such produce; (c) Any income attributable to a farm house subject to fulfillment of conditions specified in the Act: (d) Any Income derived from saplings or seedlings grown in a nursery.As per Section 10 (1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, agricultural income is exempted from tax.The panel has expressed concern that while the CAG Report of 2019 flags that Audit review of the scrutiny assessments in the selected cases during 2008-09 to 2013-14 indicated that in 1 ,527(22.5 per cent) of the 6,778 scrutiny assessments, the claim of exemption on account of agricultural income was allowed without verification of supporting documents such as the land records, income and expenditure statements, crop information, proof of agricultural income and expenditure such as ledger account, bills, invoices etc. the report Further states that, Audit scrutiny revealed that of the 1,527 cases, land records were not available in 716 cases (l0.6 per cent) and proof of agricultural income and expenditure such as ledger account, bills, invoices etc. were not available in 1,270 cases (18.7 per cent).",Rahul Shrivastava,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/income-tax-return-parliamentary-panel-pushes-for-strict-assessment-of-agricultural-incomes-1934237-2022-04-06

It has been alleged by Amazon that on March 3, as many as 600 stores of FRL were taken away by Reliance.At the outset, senior advocate Gopal Subramanium, appearing for the US firm, had said as far as the resumption of the arbitration proceedings is concerned, there is no difference of opinion between Amazon and Future Group.""But there cannot be a sudden handover of assets,"" Subramanium had said, adding that the US firm needs an interim order ""against alienation of the assets in favour of any other party and the assets must continue to remain with FRL and operate with FRL until the matter is resolved by the arbitral tribunal"".He had said over 800 shops of FRL have been vacated and taken over by the Reliance group.Amazon had apprehended the ""disappearance"" of assets and sought an interim order from the top court to ensure the preservation of the FRL assets, besides the resumption of arbitration over FRL's merger deal with Reliance Retail.The bench had taken note of the allegations of the US firm that the ""applecart was being upset"" by its rivals and asked the Future Group firms -- FRL and Future Coupons Limited (FCPL) -- to respond to Amazon's interim plea.Senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for FRL, had said around 374 shops are with the group and it is not going to give those to anybody on its own unless some landlords throw them out.""My bank accounts are frozen and I cannot pay rent. Everyone is hoping that if the scheme gets through, Reliance comes in and everyone will get the money,"" he had said, adding that there is no money to pay the rentals and moreover, if the lending banks come into the picture, the IBC (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code) will come into play.",Aneesha Mathur,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/future-retail-amazon-reliance-dispute-supreme-court-orders-resumption-of-arbitration-1934183-2022-04-06

123,"April 6, 2022",01:32 IST,Business, ,Sri Lanka economic crisis explained in 10 points,"Protests against Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's handling of a deepening economic crisis in the island nation continue to rage. In another setback for the administration, Finance Minister Ali Sabry resigned a day after his appointment and ahead of crucial talks scheduled with the International Monetary Fund for a loan programme.The debt-heavy economy has led to shortages of food, fuel and medicines and prolonged power cuts. Let's take a look at why Sri Lanka is facing its worst economic crisis in decades.1. A severe shortage of foreign currency has left Rajapaksa's government unable to pay for essential imports, including fuel, leading to debilitating power cuts lasting up to 13 hours, according to a Reuters report.2. Ordinary Sri Lankans are also dealing with shortages and soaring inflation, after the country steeply devalued its currency last month ahead of talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a loan programme.3. Critics say the roots of the crisis, the worst in several decades, lie in economic mismanagement by successive governments that created and sustained a twin deficit - a budget shortfall alongside a current account deficit.4. ""Sri Lanka is a classic twin deficits economy,"" said a 2019 Asian Development Bank working paper. ""Twin deficits signal that a country's national expenditure exceeds its national income, and that its production of tradable goods and services is inadequate,"" the Reuters report said.5. But the current crisis was accelerated by deep tax cuts promised by Rajapaksa during a 2019 election campaign that were enacted months before the Covid-19 pandemic, which wiped out parts of Sri Lanka's economy.6. With the country's lucrative tourism industry and foreign workers' remittances sapped by the pandemic, credit ratings agencies moved to downgrade Sri Lanka and effectively locked it out of international capital markets.7. In turn, Sri Lanka's debt management programme, which depended on accessing those markets, derailed and foreign exchange reserves plummeted by almost 70 per cent in two years.8. The Rajapaksa government's decision to ban all chemical fertilisers in 2021, a move that was later reversed, also hit the country's farm sector and triggered a drop in the critical rice crop.9. As of February, the country was left with only $2.31 billion in its reserves but faces debt repayments of around $4 billion in 2022, including a $1 billion international sovereign bond (ISB) maturing in July. ISBs make up the largest share of Sri Lanka's foreign debt at $12.55 billion, with the Asian Development Bank, Japan and China among the other major lenders.10. In a review of the country's economy released last month, the IMF said that public debt had risen to ""unsustainable levels"" and foreign exchange reserves were insufficient for near-term debt payments.For months, Rajapaksa's administration and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) resisted calls by experts and opposition leaders to seek help from the IMF despite rising risks.But after oil prices soared in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in late February, the government eventually drew up a plan to approach the IMF in April.The IMF would initiate discussions with Sri Lankan authorities on a possible loan program in ""coming days"", an IMF spokesman said last week.Before heading to the IMF, Sri Lanka steeply devalued its currency, further stoking inflation and adding to the pain of the public, many of whom are enduring hardship and long queues.In the interim, Rajapaksa has also sought help from China and India, particularly assistance on fuel from the latter. A diesel shipment under a $500 million credit line signed with India in February.Sri Lanka and India have signed a $1 billion credit line for importing essentials, including food and medicine, and the Rajapaksa government has sought at least another $1 billion from New Delhi, as per Reuters.After providing the CBSL with a $1.5 billion swap and a $1.3 billion syndicated loan to the government, China is considering offering the island nation a $1.5 billion credit facility and a separate loan of up to $1 billion, Reuters reported.",India Today Web Desk,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/sri-lanka-economic-crisis-currency-economy-1933828-2022-04-05

Besides the usual stuff which is not worth repeating, someone had declared ""NFTs are bad investments"". A few weeks later either the same person or someone else overwrote on it, so now it reads ""NFTs are good investments"".Without getting in to NFTs specifically, the point is that good or bad investments are often judged by only one thing returns. But really that’s only one side of the coin. Risk is the often ignored but equally important element of investing. It’s probably ignored because its notoriously hard to measure and humans famously prefer cognitive ease.There really is no one-size-fits-all type asset allocation. Age, risk appetite (and other behavioural factors), personal finances and circumstances are all important building blocks for the right mix. So, an investment idea you picked up on a WhatsApp, even if it is recommended earnestly, may not be right for you.A sound asset allocation ensures an investor has exposure to multiple asset classes that are not correlated with each other. Most investors are typically overexposed to 1-2 asset classes in India those are usually real estate / fixed deposits and gold.The first thing to keep in mind is to determine the appropriate asset allocation and next one, which is much harder, is to make sure you have the discipline to stick to that framework.I think something that’s really important to guard against in these times is recency bias and FOMO.""Modern humanity is sick with FOMO Fear of Missing Out and though we have more choice than ever before, we have lost the ability to really pay attention to whatever we choose.""

And the thing is, “on tilt” can also happen in the opposite situation that is if the player won a hand due to great luck.Similarly, if someone you know or you make great money on a hot IPO / stock / cryptocurrency, don’t invest “on tilt” and pile in to the next one without considering its merits and risks.(The article is written by Atanuu Agarrwal, Co-Founder, Upside AI)",India Today Web Desk,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/risk-and-returns-in-investment-things-to-keep-in-mind-1933727-2022-04-05

The spurt in prices has triggered inflation fears and is putting a burden on common people.This comes as the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine has resulted in a steep increase in international oil and gas prices.There has been a sharp hike in vegetable prices. Prices of tomatoes, pumpkin, chilli, radish, and gourd have gone up rapidly, according to an ANI report. Vegetable vendors and traders have cited price hikes as the prime reason behind this sudden increase in vegetable prices.Price rise is also having a negative impact on the demand for chicken, cooking oil and branded basmati rice. While the global price of basmati rice has escalated, the rates of regional varieties have gone up, according to an Economic Times report.The country, which is dependent on the imports of edible oil to meet over 60 per cent of its domestic demand, has seen a sharp rise in retail prices of various types of cooking oils in the last couple of months due to the global geopolitical situation. The prices have continued to rule firm despite several government measures, as per a PTI report.The average retail price of sunflower oil rose as high as Rs 184.58 per kg as on April 4 compared to the rate of Rs 161.71 a kg on January 1 this year.Similarly, the average retail price of soyabean oil has increased to Rs 162.13 per kg from Rs 148.59 per kg, while that of palm oil has risen to Rs 151.59 per kg from Rs 128.28 per kg in the said period.Mustard oil saw an increase of Rs 2.78 per kg to hit Rs 188.54 in the said period.Petrol and diesel prices were on Tuesday hiked by 80-85 paise a litre each, taking the total increase in rates in the last two weeks to more than Rs 9.20 per litre.This is the 13th increase in prices since the ending of a four-and-half-month-long hiatus in rate revision on March 22.On March 22, the domestic LPG gas price was increased by Rs 50 per cylinder.Milk prices have already been hiked by Amul, Parag and others.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is likely to maintain the status quo on interest rates in its forthcoming monetary policy review but may change its stance in view of retail inflation piercing its upper tolerance limit, PTI reported, quoting experts.The RBI Governor-headed rate setting panel -- Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) -- will be holding its first meeting of the 2022-23 fiscal from April 6 to 8. The outcome will be announced on April 8.Chief Economist of ICRA Limited Aditi Nayar said in the April 2022 policy review, the MPC is expected to revise up its Consumer Price Index-based inflation forecast.READ ",Debjit Sinha,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/household-budgets-on-rise-as-petrol-diesel-to-vegetable-oil-milk-prices-spike-1933716-2022-04-05

This will hit construction, manufacturing and import activities.Read: How the Russia-Ukraine war may affect India’s platterCarmakers have announced a price hike from April 1 owing to high raw material and logistics costs coupled with the current geopolitical situation.An increase in the prices of commodities such as steel and aluminium, along with an increase in the costs of other raw materials, is also abetting the price rise.From home-grown automaker Tata Motors to luxury car makers, cars in all segments are set to cost more.The semiconductor supply chain across the Black Sea region has been hit and the situation continues to pose a threat to the automobile sector.Important metals such as palladium used in semiconductors are supplied by Russia, while Ukraine supplies special gases such as neon and helium required for chip making.Over the past few months, Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors, Hyundai, and Honda have been registering a drop in production.The global crisis and rising fuel costs have resulted in cars becoming expensive for the consumer.Russia is one of the top three suppliers of fuels -- oil and gas -- in the world. With sanctions imposed on it and with the US, the UK and some parts of Europe banning Russian oil, a domino impact has been felt across the globe.India buys about $1 billion of oil from Russia, though its oil import bill is over $82 billion (for 2021) - a 108 per cent rise from 2020.The first casualty of the fuel price rise is vegetable and fruit prices. Once the fuel prices go up, it results in higher transportation costs, which in turn drives fruit and vegetable prices. The vegetable and fruit rates have increased by 10 to 20 per cent.Read: Russia-Ukraine crisis: Indian economy to face turbulence in days to come, say expertsThere has been an increase in the prices of tomatoes, chillies, peas, apples and pomegranates in the market.For the aam admi, the pain doesn't stop at fruit and vegetable prices, the war has also driven the prices of cooking oil.The country has seen an increase in the price of packaged sunflower oil by 4 per cent in February, mustard oil by 8.7 per cent. Groundnut oil was up 1 per cent and vanaspati rose by 2.7 per cent.Nearly 70 per cent of the country's edible oil comes from Ukraine. Ukraine and Russia together accounted for nearly 13 per cent of all of India’s edible oil imports last year.Taken together, Russia-Ukraine produces 60 per cent of sunflower oil.According to Kunal Vora, Head of India Equity Research at BNP Paribas India, ""Edible oil prices have increased 15-20 per cent year-on-year. We expect prices to rise further due to the recent increase in edible oil prices.""Echoing the same sentiment, Shammi Agarwal, MD, Pansari Group said, ""Edible oil prices have gone up from Rs 125 to around Rs 170-180 in the past one month and we expect prices to shoot up during May-June. The war has disrupted the supply chain.""India gets more than 90 per cent of its sunflower oil from Ukraine and Russia. It is feared that retail prices might worsen if the war continues to drag on for long.In the financial year ending March 2021, India imported about 13.35 million tonnes of edible oil worth more than $10.5 billion.Even as the common man is paying dearly for fuel, dealers warned consumers to be ready to shell out more in the coming days.All India Petroleum Dealers Association President Ajay Bansal told India Today, ""Consumers should be mentally prepared to pay more. Expect prices to rise for the next 15 days.”Highlighting the reasons behind the hike in prices, he said, ""The price rise is due to the Russia-Ukraine war and the sanctions on Russia. India is dependent on international crude supply and international prices impact Indian consumers. India ships about 90 per cent of its oil needs from overseas markets.""According to petrol pump dealers, the common man can get some respite from rising fuel costs if tax is cut by the centres and states.Dealers said, ""Our margins have not increased since 2017, though our costs have gone up. We will need an increase soon, so if the government can undertake an excise duty cut, it will cushion the price increase for consumers. ""Dealers expect prices to increase between 80-90paise/litre every day for the next 15 days.",Aishwarya Paliwal,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/russia-ukraine-war-indian-economy-hike-fuel-price-vegetable-cooking-oil-cars-expensive-1932160-2022-04-01

177,"March 30, 2022",16:09 IST,Business, ,New income tax rules: Know major changes in ITR from April 1,"The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) will be introducing a slew of major changes to the income tax from April 1 under the Income-tax (25th Amendment) Rule 2021. While the crypto taxation to be introduced from April 1 has been the prime point of concern among many, the government has also incorporated some changes in filing of updated returns, new tax rules on EPF interest, and tax relief on Covid-19 treatment.One of the major changes in the non-crypto sector includes the introduction of a cap of tax-free contributions up to Rs 2.5 lakh on the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) account.Another major change has been introduced to the income tax return. Now onwards, the taxpayers will have the flexibility to file an updated return for errors or mistakes made in income tax returns within two years from the end of the relevant assessment year.Previously, one could get a window of just 5 months from the due date of filing returns, to revise the tax returns. However, one won't be able to file an updated return to report any sort of additional loss or decrease in the tax liability.This provision has been specifically introduced to provide an opportunity for those who missed or undisclosed income or faced any other error leading to less filing of tax in the original tax return.Dividends earned from mutual funds or domestic firms will be put under tax brackets from now onwards. A high burden of tax will be levied on investors in higher tax brackets, while less burden will be put on those in lower tax brackets.The amendment also includes provisions for state government employees, Covid affected families and differently-abled persons.Special provisions of tax exemption will be available to Covid affected families too. There will be no tax levied on the money received up to Rs 10 lakh by the family members of the deceased, if they have received the amount within 12 months of the death.Finally, if the guardians of such individuals buy an insurance scheme for them, they can also claim tax exemption under certain circumstances.State government employees can also claim deduction under Section 80CCD(2) for NPS contribution by the employer up to 14 per cent of their basic salary and dearness allowance.Finally, the taxation on the digital assets including crypto currency has grabbed the maximum criticism from investors. Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman announced during the Union Budget Session 2022 that a tax of flat 30 per cent will be levied on any gain made from the digital assets like crypto currency.While the investors will be charged this way, there is also a taxation imposed on the receivers of the digital assets. The receiver who might have received digital assets as a gift may have to pay 1% TDS and gift tax under certain conditions.(The article is written by Bibin Babu, Co-Founder, Colexion)",India Today Web Desk,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/new-income-tax-rules-know-major-changes-in-itr-from-april-1-1931452-2022-03-30

194,"March 29, 2022",07:58 IST,Business, ,RBI finds 600 illegal lending apps operating in India,"A Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Working Group on digital lending has identified a whopping 600 illegal lending apps operating in India in the last year. As per RBI, “Sachet”, a portal established by RBI against unregistered entities, has received approximately 2,562 complaints against digital lending apps between the start of January 2020 to end of March 2021.The government has designated the RBI’s Department of Supervision as the nodal department for dealing with complaints against unauthorised digital lending platforms. The department has laid out a mechanism to handle specific references to unauthorised digital lending platforms.In December 2020, the RBI cautioned the general public not to fall prey to unscrupulous activities of unauthorised digital lending platforms and verify the antecedents of the company or firm offering such loans.The RBI has also issued advisories to state governments to keep a check on such applications through their respective law enforcement agencies.Further, 27 unlawful loan lending apps were blocked following the due process specified in the Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking for Access of Information for Public) Rules, 2009, notified under section 69A of Information Technology Act, 2000, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology.The RBI has been raising the red flag on the explosion in digital lending apps in India, especially during the pandemic and ensuing lockdowns. As people suffered hardships in the form of job losses and poor access to banking services, a large number of apps promising quick cash mushroomed.The government informed the Lok Sabha on Monday that the RBI studied state-wise complaints from borrowers received from January 2020 to March 2021.Most complaints were received from Maharashtra (572), followed by Karnataka (394), Delhi (352), Haryana (314), Telangana (185), Andhra Pradesh (144), Uttar Pradesh (142), West Bengal (138), Tamil Nadu (57), Gujarat (56).RBI had received complaints about the exorbitant rate of interest charged by some apps and also the extensive process of recovery of loans.Despite a crackdown in countries like China against such apps, India has the highest number of them. In November last year, a panel was set up by the central bank and it was found that more than half of about 1,100 digital loan providers were operating illegally.Experts say that the proliferation of these apps, despite the high rates of interest charged by them, indicates the demand for credit which the traditional lending or financial system is unable to meet due to various reasons.Following red flags raised by the government, tech giants like Google, whose Android platform is most popular in India, carried out an elaborate review exercise on apps available on its Play Store.According to sources, Google has specified some dos and dont's for app promoters, which makes the submission of proof by platforms a must -- that they have the appropriate lending licenses.But digital lending is proving to be a hard-to-tame market with a huge footprint. The RBI panel is aware the apps which are shut out by platforms like Google circumvent the restrictions by moving to third platforms or using text messaging to advertise.A lot of lending platforms are operated by offshore entities beyond Indian legal jurisdiction. The Reserve Bank of India is said to be considering a new set of tougher rules which include higher penalties against non-compliant apps and unregulated loan providers.",Rahul Shrivastava,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/rbi-illegal-lending-apps-india-play-store-blocked-high-interest-rates-1930729-2022-03-29

196,"March 28, 2022",16:11 IST,Business, ,Cancer cover in health insurance: 5 things you need to know,"Cancer, though a deadly disease, can be cured if diagnosed timely, thanks to growing advancement in medical science and technology. It is no surprise that the treatment could be prolonged and expensive as it involves multiple diagnostic tests, radiation therapy, surgical procedures and/or chemotherapy sessions. The process is, no doubt, taxing on the patient as well as the family members. A large part of the financial woes can be mitigated by purchasing a health insurance plan with coverage for cancer.Listed below are the top 5 things to know when looking for cancer cover in health insurance:1. Standalone Cancer Insurance v/s Regular Health Insurance: Most regular health insurance plans in India cover the insured for hospitalization expenses related to cancer treatment, either as part of the base policy or in the form of add-on riders.However, these plans may not necessarily take care of all non-hospital expenditure, which can compound to quite a substantial amount especially in the case of cancer treatment. The alternate option is to go for specific cancer insurance plans that provide wider coverage particularly for the treatment of this ailment.2. Lumpsum Payment v/s Reimbursement: The amount payable by the insurer could be a one-time fixed lumpsum payable upon diagnosis (as seen in most cancer insurance plans), or as a reimbursement of actual expenses incurred.3. Types of Cancers Covered: All health insurance plans do not cover all types of cancer by default. Even cancer-specific insurance plans would cover predetermined list as defined by the insurance company. Here, it is important to check the list of exclusions to ensure that any cancer of personal concern is not omitted for coverage.4. Stages of Cancer Covered: Again, the stages at which the cancer is covered would vary from plan-to-plan. Moreover, certain insurers also enlist the amount payable at each stage of detection, which is important to note.5. Limitation of Coverage / Benefit: Another crucial point to be aware of is whether the selected plan imposes any co-payment (i.e. to be borne by the policyholder) on the cost of cancer treatment, or any sub-limits i.e. upper cap on the amount payable by the insurance company.Additionally, a desirable policy feature is having Restoration or Reinstatement Benefit (refurbishment of Sum Insured on raising medical claim) for same disease treatment, as the treatment of cancer may involve multiple medical interventions.(The article is written by Vivek Narain, Health Insurance Specialist, SANA Insurance Brokers Pvt.

212,"March 25, 2022",14:57 IST,Business, ,"From right technology to lay offs, key lessons from Covid-19 for offices","When the pandemic Covid-19 first struck the world two years ago, it ushered in a wave of upheaval followed by another and another. From upending countless businesses, jobs and lives, the pandemic has transformed all facets of work once and for all.There is no going back but to keep finding one new normal after next. HR leaders across the globe were thrust to the frontline and tasked with training employees on remote work, helping them navigate challenges as everyone worked from home, managing company-wide lay-offs and adopting never-before-seen tech.Even in the crucible of crisis, HR teams steered their organisations through uncertainties, disruptions and cruxes. The practices adopted and the lessons learnt during the pandemic are sure to be carried to the post-pandemic world and enlighten the obscure path ahead.As the dust settles and we continue to forge new paths in an ever-changing world, here are some key lessons HR teams have learnt over the course of two pandemic-afflicted years.When the global pandemic upended work nearly overnight, organisations quickly transitioned to work from home or remote work to ensure business continuity. The early apprehensions and hesitations gave way to faith and confidence in employees and, eventually, productivity gains.With nearly 95 per cent of the workforce working remotely, organisations developed policies for employees to work remotely and familiarize themselves with virtual meetings and communication tools. Now, two years later, employees and employers are profiting from remote and flexible working models with elevated productivity, performance and work-life balance. Employees no longer want to be tethered to offices and want to work with autonomy and flexibility.After having barely braved the pandemic, several organisations are putting in place contingency plans to insulate their business against any future Black Swan events. Millions of businesses across the globe had to shut down operations due to the pandemic.To prevent any future business closure, organisations are not just focusing on growth strategies but also planning for business continuity and contingency. By investing in risk analysis and management, companies can devise strategies to respond to unexpected crises that may threaten business survival in the future.Perhaps the biggest lesson learnt from the pandemic is embracing the right technology to cushion against sudden catastrophes. The pandemic accelerated the adoption of technology and digitalisation as businesses realised their transforming effects.With the right investments in technology, many businesses were able to scale business operations and innovate in a time when others were struggling to survive. AI and automation helped organisations streamline complex business functions and eliminate redundant tasks. And cloud-based tech tools helped employees collaborate, reduce paperwork and improve performance.Business leaders across the globe learnt how crucial it was to build a leadership pipeline to ensure business continuity and improve organisational resilience. Fostering resilience in employees and preparing them for future roles and responsibilities suddenly became the need of the hour.Mere leadership training is no longer sufficient by future leaders must be scouted, groomed, prepared and tested over time. By identifying linchpin positions, integrating succession planning with leadership development and measuring progress regularly, organisations can prepare an army of leaders of tomorrow who are ready to take on responsibilities and challenges.While in the first year of the pandemic, employees held onto their jobs for dear life lest they might lose them, the second year reversed the roles. With surging demand for tech talent across the globe, employees began to leave existing jobs for better roles in droves.The ‘Great Resignation’ taught employers how hard retaining employees can be and why they must build robust talent acquisition strategies. To win the war for talent, many organisations have partnered with online hiring platforms to leverage their abundant resources, advanced technologies, fast hiring velocity and vast geographical footprint.The Covid-19 pandemic has fundamentally altered how we work, hire and live. HR teams across the globe have learnt innumerable lessons no playbook could have taught them. Organisations have hatched innovative and novel strategies no business could have foreseen two years ago. Many of the past strategies have been abandoned and organisations have accepted constant and continuous learning and changing is the only way forward. What the next year brings cannot be ascertained, but the two years of the Covid-19 pandemic have taught every business countless valuable lessons that can help them brave future crises.(The writer is Yogita Tulsiani MD- C0 Founder at iXceed Solutions.)",India Today Web Desk,https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/work-from-home-key-lessons-from-covid-19-for-offices-1929415-2022-03-25

223,"April 9, 2022",17:54 IST,World, ,"Ukraine is a puppet controlled by outside, says Donetsk People’s Republic leader Denis Pushilin","Amid Russia's continuous attempt to secure the Donetsk region, Denis Vladimirovich Pushilin, a separatist leader and head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), speaks exclusively to India Today's Geeta Mohan.While calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a puppet of the West, Denis said that the ""Russian army will keep moving forward till we take the whole Donetsk region"".India Today: Let’s begin with the latest news of rockets that hit a railway station in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk.Denis Pushilin: We constantly get such provocations from the Ukrainian army. They spread such fake information and news, you also must have heard of the attack on a maternity hospital and a drama theatre in Mariupol. When we liberated Mariupol, there was no confirmation of such crimes. Then there were reports about the city of Bucha and the latest provocations (allegations) from there. The first mass media that appeared at such places of provocation were from Great Britain. It was Sky News. They were also present at Kramatorsk today.As we know, Kramatorsk was hit by Tochka-U, a tactical missile system. I want to specify that this weapon is only used by Ukraine because for DPR (Donetsk People’s Republic), LPR (Luhansk People’s Republic) and Russia, it is already outdated. We do not use such weapons.Ukraine also hit our territories with these missiles. Since February 17, at least 24 such rockets have been shot down by us. On March 14, one fell in the centre of Donetsk as a result of which 21 persons were killed and 38 injured. It was shot down by our anti-missile system but one of the cluster bombs exploded.This (Kramatorsk incident) is happening because Ukraine wanted new pictures since Bucha is already outdated. They want something hot, something new, to maintain these tensions.They used these civilians as human shields.India Today: Are you accusing Ukraine of bombing their people?Denis Pushilin: We have been accusing Ukraine already for eight years because they used weapons and personnel to fight with us. Since the beginning of the escalation, a total of 518 objects of infrastructure facilities have been damaged, including hospitals, schools, etc. And I am not counting the housing facilities here. They have destroyed a lot of them.India Today: Russia’s membership in the UNHRC was suspended and Moscow responded by terminating membership permanently. Sanctions continue to be placed against Russia, which affects the people of Donetsk as well. In the end, it is the people who are suffering.Answer: The citizens here have already suffered sanctions for eight years. There have been economic blockades, transport blockades, sanctions, as well as restrictions that were imposed. Now, these additional sanctions imposed against Russia do not impact us.About the international community, I would like to say that they don’t want to accuse Russia, they want to destroy Russia economically, to make Russia lose its sovereignty. But, I should also state that some countries think otherwise, like China, India, the BRICS countries. They are quite capable of understanding what is happening here. The sanctions would have been imposed against Russia in any case, if not for Donbas, then for Crimea or Kaliningrad, or they would just dream something up.We can now see that the real world order is changing. The US and the UK don’t like the fact that the world is changing and they are now losing their supremacy and leadership around the world. Some European countries are also being used to their advantage. They don’t care about the people. You have seen the rise in oil prices that has affected residents.Sanctions don’t lead to anything good and resolving matters. What is Russia doing? Russia is protecting its sovereignty and respects the interests of the people of the Russian Federation. Russia is acting in the interests of its citizens and I suppose it is right in doing so.India Today: Your assessment of the situation on the ground? With hard positions taken by Ukraine, Russia and the Donbas region, how and when do you think peace will return?Denis Pushilin: The aim of the ‘Special Military Operations’ (invasion of Ukraine) was defined. It is to defend the DPR and LPR territories (the two that make up the Donbas region), protect the citizens, denazification, demilitarisation, the neutral state of Ukraine as well as the non-nuclear state status of Ukraine. These are simple conditions to ensure peace. But, believe me, I have been negotiating with Ukraine for seven years, including the Minsk agreements. Ukraine is in no place to negotiate because it is a puppet. They don’t make decisions. That is why these conditions cannot and have not been met. Ukraine is controlled by the outside. This special military operation launched by Russia, which is a liberation operation for us, will remain until every aim is achieved.India Today: What are the aims and are there redlines?Denis Pushilin: All the conditions have been made public. If you are talking about the status of Crimea and the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, this is also a condition because in Crimea there was a referendum that was held and people there themselves decided to go to Russia after the 2014 coup d’état in Ukraine. It was a decision by the people. Crimea was a part of Russia till 1953.As far as Donbas is concerned, we were doing everything to engage in the diplomatic negotiations and to bring about concrete results. For seven years, Ukraine was, by all means, delaying the process of negotiations. In eight years, more than 5,000 people have been killed in our territory, including 100 children. There was a monstrous scale of destruction of infrastructure during the period. In 2021 and the beginning of 2022, Ukraine, with all its military power and might provided by the West, decided to send its army and military into Donbas and use force against us. As our intelligence services brought us this information, we urged the President of the Russian Federation to help us defend our territory and our civilians. The Russian Federation recognised us, which was the only real decision in these circumstances. If Russia hadn't intervened, our region would have suffered hundreds and thousands of casualties. Ukraine would have demolished the Donbas. There was a huge amount of military weapons and equipment that were being mobilised. We thank God that most of this weaponry has already been destroyed by us. As you know, there are negotiations underway between Russia and Ukraine.Ukraine is using the same tactics as it did with the Minsk agreements - delaying, PR campaigns, fake news and so on.They change documents, their offers and their positions. In my personal opinion, it will not lead to any positive results.India Today: You once said the Ukrainian President and the West accused the leaders of DPR and LPR of being puppets of Russia and President Putin. Is the NATO expansion the reason why these buffer states are being created or is it about the people? You still are not recognised by the world, but only by Russia.Denis Pushilin: If we are talking about puppets, I would like to say the Donetsk People’s Republic has more independent thinking and has a say in the decision-making process for the sake of its citizens. Kyiv does not have such independence and opportunities. Zelenskyy, who won 70% of the votes in the elections, his slogans were of peace, to stop the war. And people came and voted for him.As he became President and as he had the opportunity to speak with pro-Western leaders, his position changed critically. He was not against the war in Donbas, he was against the Russian language and the Russian-speaking people. This was despite the interests and the will of the people who voted for him. I would also like to state that he is worse than Poroshenko (former Ukrainian President) because he committed more war crimes, killed civilians and destroyed infrastructure here.Talking about our destiny, our fate; our position is unchanged and non-negotiable. We would like to be close to Russia because Russia is our purpose of existence, it is our motherland. We were born in the USSR and we know that all our achievements were made when we were united -- victory in the World War, the first spaceman, big economic advancement, plants, infrastructure were built then.About NATO, the Russian Federation openly stated that the invasion (expansion) of NATO continues and that Russia should react. NATO expansion is a huge threat to the civilians of Russia and its borders and Russia cannot neglect this expansion.After the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO made a lot of promises and it broke all the promises. There have been talks of Ukraine entering NATO. If that happens, missiles and rockets can be launched from Ukraine into Russian territory within 7-10 minutes. That is why Russia insists on Ukraine’s neutrality and that it should not join any military bloc or organisation.I am convinced that Russia cannot ignore the interests of its country, its people and its borders.India Today: Given the current circumstances, are the Minsk agreements dead?Denis Pushilin: Yes, completely. With the recognition of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states by Russia, the Minsk agreements lost their sense. But, let me add, the Minsk agreements were buried much earlier. In the last seven years, not a single clause of the Minsk-II accord or package of agreements has been implemented. We did everything to make Ukraine comply, but they didn’t do it.India Today: Ukraine says it is because Russian forces were present in Donbas that they could not implement the Minsk package.Denis Pushilin: Ukraine also stated that it has had hostilities with Russia in those eight years, but when the special military operation began, things changed critically.India Today: A lot of people have lost their homes and lives. Could there have been an alternative to war?Denis Pushilin: My personal opinion is that the fate and destiny of Ukraine were decided in 2014 when the Western countries forced Ukraine into a coup d’état and they wanted to make Ukraine a platform for aggression and attack against the Russian Federation. So, I think that is it. Whether we like it or not, we have to take up arms to defend ourselves, our land and our family. The Ukrainian army and military in Donetsk used all their arms to attack the civilian population. It is a war crime since it violates international humanitarian laws and the constitution of Ukraine, but they did it. I suppose, in early 2014, there was no alternative.India Today: Russia has decided to sell gas only in Rubles. Is this de-dollarisation of the global economy an economic masterstroke or could it lead to further isolation?Denis Pushilin: I suppose it is the right decision. But, I cannot speak on behalf of the Russian Federation since I am not authorised to do so, but after the Bretton Woods Agreement and when the world decided to go from a gold-to-gold currency relationship, a lot of countries came under high risk. Nowadays, we can see that the dollar is a high-risk currency.My opinion is to forget about the dollar and shift to the national currency, using mutual agreements and according to mutual needs.India Today: There are people both in Russia and across the Donbas who are urging leaders to resolve them through talks and not through military. What is your message to them?Denis Pushilin: We have a saying about the peaceful sky. We would like to emphasise the peaceful situation. We never understood when our elders used the phrase peaceful sky. For us, it was just a phrase. During the past eight years, we have recognised what it means, we recognised that it means we should care and be thankful that everyone is alive, that your family, friends and relatives are alive; that your house is safe;. The infrastructure is not destroyed. That is of unique value. I hope that normalcy returns in the Donbas.READ | Russian attack on Ukraine station killing 52 people a war crime, says Zelenskyy | Top Points",Geeta Mohan,https://www.indiatoday.in/world/russia-ukraine-war/story/ukraine-is-a-puppet-it-is-controlled-by-the-outside-leader-of-donetsk-people-republic-denis-pushilin-russia-ukraine-1935516-2022-04-09

""We understand the consequences of a hard default.""J.P. Morgan analysts estimated this week that Sri Lanka's gross debt servicing would amount to $7 billion this year, with the current account deficit coming in around $3 billion.The country has $12.55 billion in outstanding international sovereign bonds, according to central bank data, and foreign reserves of $1.93 billion at the end of March.""The first priority is to see that we get back to the normal supply channel in terms of fuel, gas, drugs... and thereby electricity so that the people's uprising can be addressed,"" Sabry said.Anti-government protests have raged across the island for days, with at least one turning violent in the country's commercial capital of Colombo, which have hurt the lucrative tourism industry that was ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic.""We respect your right to protest, but no violence, because it is counterproductive,"" Sabry said.""Our tourism, which was beautifully coming back in February with 140,000 tourists coming in, has been severely affected ever since the demonstrations.""Sabry said he will lead a delegation of Sri Lankan officials to Washington to start talks with the IMF on April 18 and that financial and legal advisers would be selected within 21 days to help the government restructure its international debt.""Once we go to them, first thing is there is a sense of confidence in the entire international monetary community that we are serious,"" he said. ""We are transparent, we are willing to engage.""On Friday, a new central bank governor raised interest rates by an unprecedented 700 basis points in a bid to tame rocketing inflation and stabilise the economy.Sri Lankan authorities will also reach out to rating agencies, Sabry said, as the country looks to regain access to international financial markets after being locked out due to multiple ratings downgrades since 2020.Sabry said the government will hike taxes and fuel prices within six months and seek to reform loss-making state-owned enterprises, in an effort to fix public finances.These measures were among key recommendations in an IMF review of Sri Lanka's economy released in early March.""These are very unpopular measures, but these are things we need to do for the country to come out of this,"" Sabry said. ""But the choice is do you do that or do you go down the drain permanently?""Sri Lanka will seek another $500 million credit line from India for fuel, which would suffice for about five weeks of requirements, Sabry said.The government would also look for support from the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank and bilateral partners including China, the United States, Britain and countries in the Middle East.""We know where we are, and the only thing is to fight back,"" Sabry said, looking relaxed in a blue T-shirt and jeans. ""We have no choice.""Discussions are ongoing with China on a $1.5 billion credit line, a syndicated loan of up to $1 billion dollars and a request from Sri Lanka's president in January to restructure some debt.""Hopefully we will be able to get some relief and which would help to keep the Sri Lanka community and the country afloat until larger infusions come in,"" Sabry said.Beijing and New Delhi have long jostled for influence over the strategically located island off India's southern tip, with the country pulling closer to China under the powerful Rajapaksa family.But in recent weeks, as the economic crisis deepened, Sri Lanka has leaned heavily on assistance from India.""We are a neutral country. We are friend of all,"" said Sabry, a lawyer who previously served as Sri Lanka's justice minister.

Large outbreaks are spreading in Asia. A new wave is sweeping across Europe,” he said, adding that some countries are reporting their highest death rates since the start of the pandemic.He said the Omicron variant of the coronavirus is a “startling reminder” of how quickly Covid-19 can mutate and spread — especially in the absence of high vaccination coverage.While some high-income countries are preparing for their second booster doses, one-third of humanity remains unvaccinated, he rued.“This is a brutal indictment of our deeply unequal world. It’s also a prime breeding ground for new variants more deaths and increased human and economic misery,” he said.Guterres said the next variant is not a question of “if” but of “when.”“We are far from our target of every country reaching 70 per cent vaccination coverage by the middle of this year. And with new variants emerging every four months on average, time is of the essence,” he said.He added that governments and pharmaceutical companies need to work together to deliver vaccines to every person, everywhere — not just in wealthy countries.A new strain of the COVID-19 Omicron variant, first detected in the United Kingdom, appears to be more transmissible than previous strains of the virus, the World Health Organization (WHO) had said.WHO said last week that the XE recombinant (BA.1-BA.2), was first detected in the United Kingdom on January 19 and more than 600 sequences have been reported and confirmed since.“Early-day estimates indicate a community growth rate advantage of 10 per cent as compared to BA.2. However, this finding requires further confirmation,” WHO had said.It added that XE belongs to the Omicron variant until significant differences in transmission and disease characteristics, including severity, may be reported.“WHO continues to closely monitor and assess the public health risk associated with recombinant variants, alongside other SARS-CoV-2 variants, and will provide updates as further evidence becomes available.”The WHO Covid-19 Weekly Epidemiological Update issued this week said that after the increase observed during the first half of March 2022, the number of new COVID-19 cases has decreased for a second consecutive week, with a 16 per cent decline during the week of March 28 through April 3 as compared to the previous week.The number of new weekly deaths also decreased sharply (-43 per cent) as compared to the previous week, when an artificial spike in deaths was observed.Across the six WHO regions, over nine million new cases and over 26,000 new deaths were reported. All regions reported decreasing trends both in the number of new weekly cases and new weekly deaths.As of April 3, over 489 million cases and over 6 million deaths have been reported globally.At the country level, the highest number of new weekly cases were reported from South Korea (2,058,375 new cases; a decline of 16 per cent), Germany (1,371,270 new cases; a 13 per cent decrease), France (959,084 new cases; a 13 per cent increase), Vietnam (796,725 new cases; a 29 per cent decline), and Italy (486,695 new cases; a 3 per cent fall).The highest number of new weekly deaths were reported in the United States of America (4,435 new deaths; a 10 per cent decline), Russia (2,357 new deaths; an 18 per cent decline), South Korea (2,336 new deaths; a 5 per cent decline), Germany (1,592 new deaths; a 5 per cent rise) and Brazil (1,436 new deaths; a 19 per cent fall).Noting that the supply of COVID-19 vaccines is not the issue as manufacturers are producing 1.5 billion doses per month, Guterres said progress in achieving vaccine equity is possible but the window is closing fast.“This means countries fulfilling and accelerating dose-sharing and donation commitments to COVAX with better quality of supply. And it means having strong national vaccine-delivery systems at the ready — including efforts to counter disinformation and get vaccines into arms.”He called on countries to commit new funding for the ACT-Accelerator and COVAX this year.The COVAX Facility is the global pooled procurement mechanism for Covid-19 vaccines through which COVAX seeks to ensure fair and equitable access to vaccines for all 190 participating economies, using an allocation framework formulated by WHO.",Press Trust of India,https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/covid-19-pandemic-far-from-over-million-new-cases-daily-says-un-chief-guterres-1935370-2022-04-09

235,"April 9, 2022",07:58 IST,World, ,Brazil's Amazon deforestation sets first-quarter record despite March dip,"Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon rainforest fell 15% in March from a year earlier, preliminary government data showed on Friday, but even with that dip it was enough to drive the most destruction during the first quarter in at least six years.From January to March, deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon rose 64% from a year ago to 941 square kilometers (363 square miles), data from national space research agency Inpe showed. That area, larger than New York City, is the most forest cover lost in the period since the data series began in 2015/2016.Destruction of the world's largest rainforest has surged since President Jair Bolsonaro took office in 2019 and weakened environmental protections, arguing that they hinder economic development that could reduce poverty in the Amazon region.The president's office and the Environment Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.A UN climate panel report on Monday warned that governments are not doing enough to rein in greenhouse gas emissions in order to avert the worst effects of global warming. While fossil fuel use is mostly to blame, deforestation accounts for about 10% of global emissions, according to the report.""Brazil is an example of what the UN climate report is saying when referring to governments not taking the necessary actions,"" said Cristiane Mazzetti, a forest campaigner in Brazil for environmental advocacy group Greenpeace.""We have a government that goes deliberately against the necessary steps to limit climate change.""Some scientists predict deforestation will continue to rise ahead of Brazil's October presidential election, as it has ahead of the last three elections.Environmental enforcement typically weakens in election years and criminals may rush to deforest ahead of a new government taking office, according to Carlos Souza Jr, a researcher at the institute Imazon.A poll on Thursday showed that left-wing former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, whose administration drastically reduced deforestation in the 2000s, would get 45% of the vote over 31% for Bolsonaro in the first round of the election.Also Read: Imran Khan says he will not accept 'imported government', calls for street protestsAlso Read: South China Sea issues handled 'properly,' Xi Jinping tells outgoing Philippine President Duterte",Reuters,https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/brazil-s-amazon-deforestation-sets-first-quarter-record-despite-march-dip-1935333-2022-04-09

238,"April 9, 2022",07:27 IST,World, ,Children among 52 killed in missile attack at crowded Ukrainian train station,"A missile hit a train station in eastern Ukraine where thousands had gathered Friday, killing at least 52 and wounding dozens more in an attack on a crowd of mostly women and children trying to flee a new, looming Russian offensive, Ukrainian authorities said.The attack, denounced by some as yet another war crime in the 6-week-old conflict, came as workers unearthed bodies from a mass grave in Bucha, a town near Ukraine’s capital where dozens of killings have been documented after a Russian pullout.Photos from the station in Kramatorsk showed the dead covered with tarps, and the remnants of a rocket with the words “For the children” painted on it in Russian. About 4,000 civilians had been in and around the station, heeding calls to leave before fighting intensifies in the Donbas region, the office of Ukraine’s prosecutor-general said.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who says he expects a tough global response, and other leaders accused Russia’s military of deliberately attacking the station. Russia, in turn, blamed Ukraine, saying it doesn’t use the kind of missile that hit the station — a contention experts dismissed.Zelenskyy told Ukrainians in his nightly video address Friday that efforts would be taken “to establish every minute of who did what, who gave what orders, where the missile came from, who transported it, who gave the command and how this strike was agreed to.”Pavlo Kyrylenko, the regional governor of Donetsk, in the Donbas, said 52 people were killed, including five children, and many dozens more were wounded.“There are many people in a serious condition, without arms or legs,” Kramatorsk Mayor Oleksandr Goncharenko said, adding that the local hospital was struggling to treat everyone.British Defense Minister Ben Wallace denounced the attack as a war crime, and U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called it “completely unacceptable.”“There are almost no words for it,” European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, in Ukraine, told reporters. “The cynical behavior (by Russia) has almost no benchmark anymore.”Ukrainian authorities and Western officials have repeatedly accused Russian forces of atrocities in the war that began with a Feb. 24 invasion. More than 4 million Ukrainians have fled the country, and millions more have been displaced. Some of the grisliest evidence has been found in towns around Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, from which Russian President Vladimir Putin’s troops pulled back in recent days.In Bucha, Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk has said investigators found at least three sites of mass shootings of civilians and were still finding bodies in yards, parks and city squares — 90% of whom were shot.Russia has falsely claimed that the scenes in Bucha were staged.On Friday, workers pulled corpses from a mass grave near a town church under spitting rain, lining up black body bags in rows in the mud.About 67 people were buried in the grave, according to a statement from Prosecutor-General Iryna Venediktova’s office, which is investigating.“Like the massacres in Bucha, like many other Russian war crimes, the missile attack on Kramatorsk should be one of the charges at the tribunal that must be held,” Zelenskyy said, his voice rising in anger late Friday.He expounded on that theme in an excerpted interview with CBS’ “60 Minutes” that aired Friday, citing communications intercepted by the Ukrainian security service.“There are (Russian) soldiers talking with their parents (about) what they stole and who they abducted. There are recordings of (Russian) prisoners of war who admitted to killing people,” he said. “There are pilots in prison who had maps with civilian targets to bomb. There are also investigations being conducted based on the remains of the dead.”Russian forces, who pulled back after failing to take the capital in the face of stiff resistance, have now set their sights on the Donbas, the mostly Russian-speaking, industrial region where Moscow-backed rebels have been fighting Ukrainian forces for eight years and control some areas.A senior U.S. defense official said Friday that the Pentagon believes some of the retreating units were so badly damaged they are “for all intents and purposes eradicated.” The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal military assessments.The official did not say how many units sustained such extensive damage, but said the U.S. believes Russia has lost between 15% and 20% of its combat power overall since the war began. While some combat units are withdrawing to be resupplied in Russia, Moscow has added thousands of troops around Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, he said.The train station hit is in Ukrainian government-controlled territory in the Donbas, but Russia insisted it wasn’t behind the attack. Its Defense Ministry accused Ukraine of carrying it out, in a statement carried by state news agency RIA Novosti. So did the region’s Moscow-backed separatists, who work closely with Russian regular troops.Experts refuted Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov’s assertion that Russian forces “do not use” that type of missile, saying Russia has used it during the war. One analyst added that only Russia would have reason to target railway infrastructure in the Donbas.“The Ukrainian military is desperately trying to reinforce units in the area and the railway stations in that area in Ukrainian-held territory are critical for movement of equipment and people,” said Justin Bronk, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London.Bronk pointed to other occasions when Russian authorities have tried to deflect blame by claiming their forces no longer use an older weapon “to kind of muddy the waters and try and create doubt.” He also suggested that Russia specifically chose the missile type because Ukraine also has it.A Western official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence, also said Russia’s forces have used the missile — and that given the strike’s location and impact, it was “likely” Russia’s.Ukrainian officials have almost daily pleaded with Western powers to send more arms, and to further punish Russia with sanctions and exclusion of Russian banks from the global financial system.NATO nations agreed Thursday to increase their supply of weapons, and Slovakian Prime Minister Eduard Heger announced on a trip to Ukraine on Friday that his country has donated its Soviet-era S-300 air defense system to Ukraine. Zelenskyy had appealed for S-300s to help the country “close the skies” to Russian warplanes and missiles.American and Slovak officials said the U.S. will then deploy a Patriot missile system to Slovakia.After meeting with Zelenskyy on Friday, during which he urged the EU to impose a full embargo on Russian oil and gas, von der Leyen provided him with a questionnaire that is a first step for applying for EU membership.In anticipation of intensified attacks by Russian forces, hundreds of Ukrainians fled villages that were either under fire or occupied in the southern regions of Mykolaiv and Kherson.In Kharkiv, Lidiya Mezhiritska stood in the wreckage of her home after overnight missile strikes turned it to rubble.“The ‘Russian world,’ as they say,” she said, wryly invoking Putin’s nationalist justification for invading Ukraine. “People, children, old people, women are dying. I don’t have a machine gun. I would definitely go (fight), regardless of age.”",Associated Press,https://www.indiatoday.in/world/russia-ukraine-war/story/russia-ukraine-war-news-missile-attack-kramatorsk-crowded-train-station-1935329-2022-04-09

In the videos, the Kadyrovites can be seen shooting in all directions while Ukrainian victims are dragged between corpses.FOLLOW LIVE UPDATES ON RUSSIA-UKRAINE WARRamzan Kadyrov is the son of a Chechen independence leader who switched sides to join the Russians. He is President Vladimir Putin's protégé, according to an AFP report. When Vladimir Putin announced the invasion of Ukraine, he immediately said he would send forces. He said his men would fight the “Nazis of Kyiv”, speaking the same language as Russia. He is taking part in the Ukraine operation to show his loyalty to Putin, as per political expert Konstantin Kalachev.The 45-year-old leader said last month that he had travelled to the besieged Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. He claimed he had found and ‘punished’ with his own hands a Ukrainian soldier who allegedly tortured a Russian.However, not everything he says can be taken at face value.

This figure is unverified. It is not even known where the Chechens are deployed in Ukraine.Meanwhile, other Chechens who oppose Kadyrov have joined Ukrainian forces to fight Russia.According to political expert Aurelie Campana, the deployment of the Kadyrovites is part of Russia’s ‘psychological war’ on Ukraine.""The announcement of the entry into the war of Kadyrov's troops and the propaganda that surrounds it are part of this effort to destabilise the enemy,"" she was quoted in an AFP report.""Involving Chechen troops serves to fuel fear within the Ukrainian population,” she added.Towards the beginning of the war, rumour had it that Putin had sent the Chechens to kill Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. Kadyrov had himself said that Zelenskyy would soon be the ""the former president of Ukraine"".However, President Zelenskyy often mocks the Kadyrovites in his daily addresses to his nation.The Kadyrovites may also be serving the purpose of disciplining Russian soldiers, as per some commentators.

President Vladimir Putin counted on a quick victory, similar to its 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula.The Russian troops that pushed into Ukraine from Moscow’s ally Belarus quickly reached the outskirts of Kyiv, only 75 kilometres (47 miles) south of the border, but they got bogged down facing Ukrainian defences.After the failed attempts to storm the capital and other big cities in the north, Russian forces tried to encircle and pummel them with artillery and airstrikes. The relentless barrages led to massive civilian casualties and damaged infrastructure but didn’t weaken Ukraine’s resolve. Ukrainian forces, meanwhile, successfully used artillery and drones against Russian convoys that stretched for dozens of kilometres (miles) along highways outside Kyiv. That created massive logistical problems for the Russians.Read: US sanctions Putin's daughters and more Russian banksOn March 29, Russia announced a drastic change in strategy, saying it would scale down military activities around Kyiv and Chernihiv, focusing instead on the “liberation” of Donbas.A quick withdrawal from areas in the north and northeast followed, with forces pulling back to Belarus and Russia for rest and resupply.Moscow sought to put a positive spin on what Ukrainian and Western officials described as the failure of the offensive. Russia said the action in the north was intended to tie down and weaken Ukrainian forces there and prevent them from joining troops engaged in the fighting in the east.Observers said it could take Russian troops several weeks for the troops to rest, resupply and regroup before they could launch a new attack in the east.Read: Our response will follow: Russia warns EU over expulsion of diplomats“Many Russian units withdrawing from northern Ukraine are likely to require significant re-equipping and refurbishment before being available to redeploy for operations in eastern Ukraine,” a tweet from the British Ministry of Defence said.Some Western estimates said nearly a quarter of Russian units involved in the fighting had been rendered unfit for further action and would need long reequipment and resupply before being sent back into combat.“They will be remanned because they have lost a lot of troops in the different units,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said. “They will be rearmed because they have used a lot of ammunition and they will be resupplied ... to launch a new big offensive.”The separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine, home to a mostly Russian-speaking population, began in 2014 shortly after the annexation of Crimea and has killed over 14,000 people. The fighting has tempered Ukrainian forces, which have gained ample combat experience and built multilayered defences along the line of contact.Those efforts paid off at the start of the Russian invasion, preventing the separatist forces and Russian troops from making any significant gains there despite far superior firepower.Read: India has chosen side of peace, disturbed by Bucha killings: Jaishankar on war in UkraineFrom the start of the invasion, Moscow’s key goal was to capture the Sea of Azov port of Mariupol to secure a coastal corridor to Crimea. Russian troops have besieged Mariupol for a month, reducing much of the city to rubble with artillery and air raids that killed thousands. So far, however, they have failed to win full control.Ukrainian and Western officials say the Russian plan is to encircle tens of thousands of Ukrainian troops in Donbas by moving from Izyum, near Kharkiv in the north, and from Mariupol in the south.The timing for the offensive depends on how quickly the Russians wrap up the battle for Mariupol and free those forces for the offensive. It also will depend on how much time is needed to resupply and regroup the troops that were pulled back from Kyiv and other areas in the north.Read: From citizens to refugees, exodus from Ukraine continues amid Russian invasion | PicsThe Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said in an analysis that the Russian troops will likely try to advance from Izyum to capture the strategic city of Slovyansk and link up with other Russian forces in Donbas in what it said: “will likely prove to be the next pivotal battle of the war in Ukraine.”Stoltenberg warned that such an eastward shift by Russia marks a “crucial phase of the war,” saying a further push in eastern and southern Ukraine is expected ”to try to take the entire Donbas and to create a land bridge to occupied Crimea.”During an eastern offensive, Russian forces will face the same problems that hampered their attack in the north.Maintaining supply lines over long distances under constant Ukrainian attacks was a key challenge that eventually doomed the blitz on Kyiv and forced Moscow’s retreat. Such an operation in the east could prove just as hard.The lack of proper cohesion among different forces, the failure to fully suppress Ukrainian air defenses, and the growing popular resistance to the invasion would likely make it difficult for quick Russian gains in the east. As they seek to encircle Ukrainian troops in Donbas, Russian forces could also face attacks on their flanks.Military success in the east could offer Putin a face-saving exit from the conflict, allowing him to claim that Moscow’s main goals were fulfilled. He could argue that Russia has destroyed the bulk of the Ukrainian military, liquidated the “neo-Nazi nationalist” forces and “liberated” Donbas.Read: World divided but India firm on its neutral stance for its interests: PM Modi on Russia-Ukraine warPutin’s conditions for peace, however, include a demand for Ukraine to acknowledge Russia’s sovereignty over Crimea and to recognize the independence of the eastern separatist regions, something that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has rejected. Zelenskyy said the issues of Crimea and Donbas could be put on hold, but Moscow wants to make them part of a deal now.Putin badly needs a quick success in the east to find a way out of the conflict that increasingly looks like a quagmire for Moscow. Time is working against Russia, with each day of war worsening the massive economic damage from Western sanctions and draining its limited resources.A protracted conflict could force the Kremlin to broadly engage in the use of poorly trained conscripts, something it has tried to avoid, claiming that it relies squarely on volunteer soldiers. Sending fresh draftees into battle would be highly unpopular and likely to fuel public discontent.Putin’s goal of freeing Ukraine from purported “neo-Nazis” has led some observers to predict that he hopes for quick gains in the east so he can announce a successful end to the campaign by May 9. That’s when Russia celebrates its victory over Nazi Germany in World War II, its most important public holiday.",Associated Press,https://www.indiatoday.in/world/russia-ukraine-war/story/russia-focus-east-ukraine-war-failed-attempt-kyiv-1934636-2022-04-07

Abstentions do not count and the resolution requires two-thirds of yes/no votes to be adopted.The draft resolution titled ‘Suspension of the rights of membership of the Russian Federation in the Human Rights Council’ notes the Human Rights Council resolution of March 4, 2022, in particular its grave concern regarding reports of “gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights” and “violations of international humanitarian law” committed by Russia during its aggression against Ukraine.The draft resolution expresses “grave concern” at the ongoing human rights and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, particularly at the reports of violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law by Russia, including gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights.It recognises strong expressions of concern in statements by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres and by the High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet.Paulina Kubiak Greer, spokesperson for General Assembly President Abdulla Shahid, told reporters that the draft resolution was submitted for co-sponsorship by Ukraine, Antigua and Barbuda, Canada, Colombia, Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Georgia, Germany, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Liberia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Republic of Moldova, the UK and the US.READ | India calls for direct negotiations between Russia, Ukraine to end ongoing conflictEarlier this week in Romanian capital Bucharest, US Ambassador at UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield had told reporters that Washington, in close coordination with Ukraine, European countries and other partners at the UN, was going to seek Russia’s suspension from the UN Human Rights Council.“Russia should not have a position of authority in that body, nor should we allow Russia to use their role on the Council as a tool of propaganda to suggest they have a legitimate concern about human rights.""In fact, we see every day, including yesterday, heartbreaking reports about how little they care about human rights. Russia’s participation on the Human Rights Council is a farce. It hurts the credibility of the Council and the UN writ large. And it is simply wrong. Which is why we believe it is time for the UN General Assembly to suspend them,” she said.Since January, India has abstained on eight occasions on procedural votes and draft resolutions in the UN Security Council, the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council condemning Russian aggression against Ukraine.New Delhi on Tuesday unequivocally condemned the “deeply disturbing” reports of civilian killings in the Ukrainian city of Bucha and supported the call for an independent investigation, as it underlined that when innocent human lives are at stake, diplomacy must prevail as the only viable option.Talking about the civilian killings in Bucha, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Wednesday said India is ""deeply disturbed"" by the reports.WATCH | India abstains from UN voting against Russia: Will ignoring Putin's war embolden dictators?""We strongly condemn the killings that have taken place there. This is an extremely serious matter and we support the call for an independent investigation,"" he said, replying to a discussion in Parliament on the situation in Ukraine.Jaishankar said India encourages talks between Ukraine and Russia, including at the level of their presidents, and asserted that if New Delhi can be of any assistance in this matter, it would be ""glad to contribute"". India's approach will be to promote dialogue to end the conflict, he said.“The situation in Ukraine has not shown any significant improvement since the Council last discussed the issue. The security situation has only deteriorated, as well as its humanitarian consequences,” India’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti told a meeting on Ukraine in the UN Security Council Tuesday that was addressed for the first time by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Russia’s current membership on the Council ends in December 2023.The only time a member state was suspended from the Geneva-based Human Rights Council was Libya in 2011 when in an unprecedented move a resolution was adopted in the General Assembly that had expressed “deep concern about the human rights situation in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya” in the wake of Muammar Al-Qadhafi’s violent crackdown on anti-government protestors.",Press Trust of India,https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/un-general-assembly-vote-today-on-russia-removal-human-rights-council-bucha-1934572-2022-04-07

It provides Russian services with access to those compromised systems, offering the ability to remotely exfiltrate or delete data or turn the devices against a third party.Watchguard issued a statement confirming it worked with the US Justice Department to disrupt the botnet but did not disclose the number of devices affected - saying only that they represented ""less than 1 per cent of WatchGuard appliances.""AsusTek, better known as Asus, did not immediately return messages seeking comment.FBI Director Chris Wray told reporters the FBI, with court approval, secretly reached into thousands of routers and firewall appliances to delete the malware and reconfigure the devices.""We removed malware from devices used by thousands of mostly small businesses for network security all over the world,"" Wray said. ""We shut the door the Russians had used to get into them.""The affidavit noted that US officials launched an awareness campaign “to inform owners of WatchGuard devices of the steps they should take to remediate infections or vulnerabilities” and yet less than half the devices had been fixed to expel the hackers.The affidavit noted that the FBI had carried out its work in cooperation with WatchGuard.The announcement came amid a flurry of new sanctions announced against Russian banks and elites, days after grim images emerged of the bodies of civilians shot at close range in the town of Bucha.Russia says its ""special military operation"" is aimed at demilitarizing and ""denazifying"" Ukraine, and it has denied targeting civilians.",Reuters,https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/us-fbi-russian-military-hackers-disrupted-1934491-2022-04-07

The U.S. also banned Americans from investing in Russia, and targeted Russian financial institutions and Kremlin officials, in response to what President Joe Biden condemned as Russian ""atrocities"" in Ukraine.Russia denies intentionally attacking civilians and says images of bodies in Bucha north of Kyiv were staged to justify more sanctions against Moscow.Moscow says it is engaged in a ""special military operation"" designed to demilitarize and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Ukraine and Western governments reject that as a false pretext for Russia's invasion.The extent of Putin's wealth is a sensitive subject in Russia. The Kremlin last year denied that he was the owner of an opulent palace on the Black Sea, as alleged by opposition politician Alexei Navalny in a video that drew a huge audience on YouTube.Also Read: Mariupol’s dead put at 5,000 as Ukraine braces for Russian attacks in the eastKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in February that sanctions introduced against Putin himself were pointless.""(Putin) is quite indifferent.

""The president has no assets other than those he has declared.""But U.S. lawmakers believe otherwise.""Putin and his oligarchs stow their dirty money in rule-of-law nations by purchasing mansions, mega-yachts, artwork, and other high-value assets,"" U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse said a few weeks ago, while introducing legislation that offered cash rewards for information that leads to the seizure of assets held by sanctioned Russian oligarchs.Putin's daughters, who the U.S. believes help him hide his wealth, have never confirmed publicly the Russian leader is their father, and he has refused to answer questions about them.A Reuters investigation from 2015 detailed the connections and influence Katerina, an acrobatic rock ’n’ roll dancer, holds in the next generation of Moscow's elite.""Katerina, 29, described herself as the spouse of Kirill Shamalov, son of Nikolai Shamalov, a longtime friend of President Putin,"" the report said. ""Shamalov senior is a shareholder in Bank Rossiya, which U.S. officials have described as the personal bank of the Russian elite.""As husband and wife, Kirill and Katerina had corporate holdings worth about $2 billion, according to estimates provided to Reuters by financial analysts. This was in addition to other property and assets.Putin's elder daughter Maria studied biology at St. Petersburg University and medicine at Moscow State University, according to the Reuters investigation. She is also heavily involved in genetic research work, which Putin has in the past described as a field that will ""determine the future of the whole world.""According to Russian and Western media reports, Maria married Dutch businessman Jorrit Joost Faassen.She was pursuing a biomedical career specializing in the endocrine system in 2015, as a doctoral candidate at the Endocrinology Research Centre in Moscow, and is the co-author of a book about ""idiopathic stunting"" in children, the Reuters report said.Her husband used to work for Gazprombank, a large lender with strong links to the elite around Putin, the report noted.

The university said Tuesday that the manuscripts were left in the library inside a pink gift bag, along with a note wishing the librarian a Happy Easter.The notebooks, which include the 19th-century scientist’s famous 1837 “Tree of Life” sketch, went missing in 2001 after being removed for photographing, though at the time staff believed they might have been misplaced. After searches of the library’s collection of 10 million books, maps and manuscripts failed to find them, they were reported stolen to police in October 2020.Local detectives notified the global police organization Interpol and launched an international hunt for the notebooks, valued at millions of pounds (dollars).On March 9 the books reappeared, left in a public area of the building, outside the librarian’s office, which is not covered by security cameras. The two notebooks were wrapped in clingfilm inside their archive box, and appeared undamaged. The accompanying note said: “Librarian Happy Easter X.”Darwin filled the notebooks with ideas shortly after returning from his voyage around the world on HMS Beagle, developing ideas that would bloom into his landmark work on evolution, “On the Origin of Species.”The university’s director of library services Jessica Gardner said her feeling of relief at the books’ reappearance was “profound and almost impossible to adequately express.”“The notebooks can now retake their rightful place alongside the rest of the Darwin Archive at Cambridge, at the heart of the nation’s cultural and scientific heritage, alongside the archives of Sir Isaac Newton and Professor Stephen Hawking,” she said.The notebooks are set to go on public display from July as part of a Darwin exhibition at the library.Cambridgeshire Police said its investigation was continuing, “and we are following up some lines of inquiry.”“We also renew our appeal for anyone with information about the case to contact us,” the force said.",Associated Press,https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/charles-darwin-missing-notebooks-cambridge-1934484-2022-04-07

He said Ukraine, too, was preparing for battle.“We will fight and we will not retreat,” he said. “We will seek all possible options to defend ourselves until Russia begins to seriously seek peace. This is our land. This is our future. And we won’t give them up.”Ukrainian authorities urged people living in the Donbas to evacuate now, ahead of an impending Russian offensive, while there is still time.“Later, people will come under fire,” Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said, “and we won’t be able to do anything to help them.”Read: We are furious: Volunteers mourn death, destruction in Ukraine’s Bucha | Ground reportA Western official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence estimates, said it will take Russia’s battle-damaged forces as much as a month to regroup for a major push on eastern Ukraine.Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko said that of the more than 5,000 civilians killed during weeks of Russian bombardment and street fighting, 210 were children. He said Russian forces bombed hospitals, including one where 50 people burned to death.Boichenko said more than 90 per cent of the city’s infrastructure has been destroyed. The attacks on the strategic southern city on the Sea of Azov have cut off food, water, fuel and medicine and pulverized homes and businesses.British defense officials said 160,000 people remained trapped in the city, which had a prewar population of 4,30,000. A humanitarian relief convoy accompanied by the Red Cross has been trying for days without success to get into the city.Capturing Mariupol would allow Russia to secure a continuous land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow seized from Ukraine in 2014.Read: Russia-Ukraine war: Lviv bids farewell to departed soulsIn the north, Ukrainian authorities said the bodies of least 410 civilians have been found in towns around Kyiv, victims of what Zelenskyy has portrayed as a Russian campaign of murder, rape, dismemberment and torture. Some victims had apparently been shot at close range. Some were found with their hands bound.At a cemetery in the town of Bucha, northeast of Kyiv, workers began to load more than 60 bodies apparently collected over the past few days into a grocery shipping truck for transport to a facility for further investigation.Zelenskyy accused Russia of interfering with an international investigation into possible war crimes by removing corpses and trying to hide other evidence in Bucha.“We have information that the Russian troops have changed tactics and are trying to remove the dead people, the dead Ukrainians, from the streets and cellars of territory they occupied,” he said in his address. “This is only an attempt to hide the evidence and nothing more.”Switching from Ukrainian into Russian, Zelenskyy urged ordinary Russians “to somehow confront the Russian repressive machine” instead of being “equated with the Nazis for the rest of your life.”He called on Russians to demand an end to the war, “if you have even a little shame about what the Russian military is doing in Ukraine.”More bodies were yet to be collected in Bucha. The Associated Press saw two in a house in a silent neighborhood. From time to time there was the muffled boom of workers clearing the town of mines and other unexploded ordnance.Police said they found at least 20 bodies in the Makariv area west of Kyiv. In the village of Andriivka, residents said the Russians arrived in early March and took locals’ phones. Some people were detained, then released. Others met unknown fates. Some described sheltering for weeks in cellars normally used for storing vegetables for winter.The soldiers were gone, and Russian armored personnel carriers, a tank and other vehicles sat destroyed on both ends of the road running through the village. Several buildings were reduced to mounds of bricks and corrugated metal. Residents struggled without heat, electricity or cooking gas.“First we were scared, now we are hysterical,” said Valentyna Klymenko, 64. She said she, her husband and two neighbors weathered the siege by sleeping on stacks of potatoes covered with a mattress and blankets. “We didn’t cry at first. Now we are crying.”To the north of the village, in the town of Borodyanka, rescue workers combed through the rubble of apartment blocks, looking for bodies. Mine-disposal units worked nearby.The Kremlin has insisted its troops have committed no war crimes, charging that the images out of Bucha were staged by the Ukrainians.Thwarted in their efforts to swiftly take the capital, increasing numbers of President Vladimir Putin’s troops, along with mercenaries, have been reported moving into the Donbas.At least five people were killed by Russian shelling Wednesday in the Donbas’ Donetsk region, according to Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko, who urged civilians to leave for safer areas.In the Luhansk region of the Donbas, Russian bombardment set fire to at least 10 multi-story buildings and a mall in the town of Sievierodonetsk, the regional governor reported. There was no immediate word on deaths or injuries.Russian forces also attacked a fuel depot and a factory in the Dnipropetrovsk region, just west of the Donbas, authorities said.Ukrainian forces have been fighting Russia-backed separatists in the Donbas since 2014. Ahead of its Feb. 24 invasion, Moscow recognized the Luhansk and Donetsk regions as independent states.In reaction to the alleged atrocities outside Kyiv, the US announced sanctions against Putin’s two adult daughters and said it is toughening penalties against Russian banks. Britain banned investment in Russia and pledged to end its dependence on Russian coal and oil by the end of the year.The European Union is also expected to take additional punitive measures, including an embargo on coal.Meanwhile, the United States and the United Kingdom boycotted an informal meeting of the Security Council called by Russia to press its baseless claims that the US has biological warfare laboratories in Ukraine.The meeting was the latest of several moves by Russia that have led Western countries to accuse Moscow of using the UN as a platform for disinformation to divert attention from the war.Russia’s deputy UN ambassador Dmitry Polyansky, who presided over the meeting, asserted that Ukraine, supported by the US, was implementing what he claimed were dangerous projects and experiments as part of a military biological program.The allegations have previously been debunked. Ukraine does own and operate a network of biological labs that have received funding and research support from the U.S. and are not a secret. The labs are part of a program that aims to reduce the likelihood of deadly outbreaks, whether natural or man-made.The US efforts date back to work in the 1990s to dismantle the former Soviet Union’s program for weapons of mass destruction.",Associated Press,https://www.indiatoday.in/world/russia-ukraine-war/story/mariupol-civilian-deaths-russia-attacks-ukraine-1934475-2022-04-07

292,"April 7, 2022",07:32 IST,World, ,"Will stifle Russia’s ability to grow, says Biden as US hits Moscow with ‘war crimes’ sanctions","The US rolled out a new wave of financial sanctions on Wednesday against Russia that President Joe Biden said would place a lasting penalty on the country’s economy.The United Kingdom quickly followed suit, and more pain was coming from the European Union as the allies pressed forward with an escalating campaign to tighten the economic screws on Russian President Vladimir Putin for “war crimes” in Ukraine.Read: We are furious: Volunteers mourn death, destruction in Ukraine’s Bucha | Ground reportMaking it personal, the US sanctions singled out the Putin’s family, targeting his two adult daughters in addition to blocking two key Russian banks.Biden said that “Russia has already failed in its initial war” after the country’s forces were turned back from the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. He cautioned, however, that “this fight is far from over.”“This war could continue for a long time,” but the United States will continue to stand with Ukraine and Ukrainians in the fight for freedom, Biden said. “We’re going to stifle Russia’s ability to grow for years to come.”The latest sanctions underscore the financial pain that Russia faces, as evidence that its troops killed Ukrainian civilians has led to ever harsher penalties by the US and its Western allies that are eroding Putin’s ability to fight.While rounds of increased sanctions have not forced Putin out of the war, they have put Russia in increasingly desperate economic circumstances as Ukrainian forces withstand his barrages. Key to the effectiveness of the sanctions has been the unity between the U.S. and European nations. And the atrocities revealed in Ukraine have intensified pressure on Germany and other countries to go further and join the US and Lithuania in blocking all Russian energy exports.Read: Ukrainian troops target Russian military camp in Donetsk | Exclusive ground reportThe UK piled on Wednesday with asset freezes against major banks, a ban on British investment in Russia and a pledge to end dependency on Russian coal and oil by yearend.The European Union was also expected to soon take additional steps, including a ban on new investment in Russia and an embargo on coal, after the recent evidence of atrocities emerging in the wake of the retreat by Russian forces from the town of Bucha.The U.S. acted against two of Russia’s largest banks, Sberbank and Alfa Bank, prohibiting assets from going through the U.S. financial system and barring Americans from doing business with those two institutions.In addition to sanctions aimed at Putin’s adult daughters, Mariya Putina and Katerina Tikhonova, the U.S. is targeting Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin; the wife and children of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov; and members of Russia’s Security Council, including Dmitry Medvedev, a former president and prime minister.The penalties cut off all of Putin’s close family members from the U.S. financial system and freeze any assets they hold in the United States.Biden was expected to sign an an executive order that would ban new investment in Russia by Americans no matter where they are living. The US Treasury Department was preparing more sanctions against Russian state-owned enterprises, according to the White House.Britain announced asset freezes targeting Sberbank and the Credit Bank of Moscow and designated eight Russian oligarchs whom it says Putin “uses to prop up his war economy.”“Together with our allies, we are showing the Russian elite that they cannot wash their hands of the atrocities committed on Putin’s orders,” British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said.Britain had already announced a plan to phase out Russian oil, which accounts for 8 per cent of the UK supply. Russia is the top supplier of imported coal to the UK, though British demand for the polluting fuel has plummeted in the past decade.Britain has not ended imports of Russian natural gas, which accounts for 4 per cent of its supply, saying only that it will do so “as soon as possible.”Videos and images of bodies in the streets of Bucha after it was recaptured from Russian forces have unleashed a wave of indignation among Western allies, who have drawn up new sanctions as a response.The European Commission’s proposed ban on coal imports would be the first EU sanctions targeting Russia’s lucrative energy industry over its war in Ukraine.EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said energy was key to Putin’s war coffers. And because the war has pushed prices higher, Russia has benefitted from being able to sell its natural gas and oil to the rest of the world.“A billion euro is what we pay Putin every day for the energy he provides us since the beginning of the war. We have given him 35 billion euro. Compare that to the one billion that we have given to the Ukraine in arms and weapons,” Borrell said.The steady intensifying in sanctions is less a sign of their shortcomings than the building pressure against Russia as it seeks foreign investment and basic goods, Brian Deese, director of the White House National Economic Council, told reporters at a Wednesday breakfast. “We need to have patience and perspective when it comes to the impacts on Russia of this unprecedented and crippling sanctions regime,” Deese said at the event sponsored by The Christian Science Monitor.Deese noted that Russian inflation is running at 2 per cent weekly, which would compound to annual inflation above 200 per cent annually. He noted that the Biden administration expects Russian prices will not ultimately rise more than 200% this year.While the White House has said Russia should not attend the G-20 meeting in Indonesia this November, he noted that it may drop out of the organization anyway because its economy has shrunk in size so dramatically.After several European countries announced the expulsion of Russian diplomats, the European Commission proposed a fifth package of sanctions including a ban on coal imports that could be adopted once unanimously approved by the 27-nation bloc’s ambassadors.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the coal ban is worth 4 billion euros ($4.4 billion) per year and that the EU has already started working on additional sanctions, including on oil imports.She didn’t mention natural gas, with consensus among the 27 EU countries on targeting the fuel used to generate electricity and heat homes difficult to secure amid opposition from gas-dependent members like Germany, the bloc’s largest economy.But European Council President Charles Michel said the bloc should keep up the pressure on the Kremlin, suggesting that an embargo on gas imports should also be required at some point in the future.“The new package includes a ban on coal imports,” Michel said on Wednesday. “I think that measures on oil, and even gas, will also be needed, sooner or later.”",Associated Press,https://www.indiatoday.in/world/russia-ukraine-war/story/us-war-crimes-sanctions-russia-joe-biden-ukraine-war-1934459-2022-04-07

The upcoming OnePlus foldable phone is something we have already seen. That is because it is rumoured to be the rebadged version of the Oppo Find N. The rumours are rife that there will be only one major difference between the Oppo Find N and the upcoming OnePlus foldable phone. For the unversed OnePlus and Oppo have the same owners—BBK Electronics. Hence it would not be surprising if OnePlus launched a rebranded Oppo Find N as its first foldable phone.As per PriceBaba in collaboration with tipster Yogesh Brar, But there is nothing completely out of the box that one can expect because it would most certainly be the rebranded version of the Oppo Find N. Now it also makes sense for OnePlus to launch the rebranded Oppo Find N because Oppo has not launched the phone in India or International markets. However, there is no information about the launch timeline of OnePlus’s foldable phone.OnePlus is tipped to launch five smartphones this year, but the foldable phone does not feature in the list yet.Oppo Find N was announced with two RAM variants 8GB of RAM and 256GB storage is priced at CNY 7,699, which translates to Rs 92,000, and the one with 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage costs CNY 8,999, roughly Rs 1,07,550. The smartphone has been launched in three colours and it is available only in China.Oppo Find N features a large 7.1-inch LTPO AMOLED display, which has a resolution of 1920x1792 pixels with support for 120Hz refresh rate and HDR10+ support.

Amid the Oscars 2022 slap controversy, an old video of the couple from the show has resurfaced. The main idea of the show was to get therapy as a family in a healthy way and fix their problems. In the old clip going viral now, Jada is seen sitting with Will, her mother Gammy and her daughter Willow Smith. She reveals she never wanted to get married in the first place.In fact, the Matrix actress admitted to “crying down the freaking aisle” before tying the knot with Will Smith on New Year’s Eve in 1997.“I was under so much pressure, you know, being a young actress, being young, and I was just, like, pregnant and I just didn’t know what to do,” said Pinkett Smith in the viral snippet from her Red Table Talk Facebook series. “I never wanted to be married,” she said.The clip from 2018 has resurfaced now after Will Smith slapped Chris Rock for making fun of his wife, Jada's baldness. In the old video, Jada Pinkett Smith also talked about how her mother, Adrienne Banfield-Norris, forced her and Will Smith to marry after she became pregnant with their first son together, Jaden, now 23.“I really didn’t wanna get married,” Pinkett Smith said at the round table. “We only got married because Gammy was crying,” a chuckling Smith informed Willow.“It was almost as if Gammy was like, ‘You have to get married, so let’s talk about the wedding,’” said Pinkett Smith, prompting Banfield-Norris to confess, “I remember feeling very strongly and wanting you guys to be married.”“The wedding was horrible,” Banfield-Norris conceded. “It was a mess. Jada was sick, she was very unpleasant She didn’t cooperate with anything.” Laughing, Pinkett Smith agreed, saying, “And I was so upset that I had to have a wedding. I was so pissed I went crying down the freaking aisle. I cried the whole way down the aisle.”In 2018, Jada Pinkett Smith revealed her alopecia diagnosis.

The new study hints at the dangerous impact this could have on the respiratory system, causing severe problems.Microplastics are small plastic pieces that are less than five millimeters long and have been found to be spread across oceans, mountains, and in the air. These are generated from large plastic debris that degrades into smaller and smaller pieces. These tiny particles easily pass through water filtration systems and end up in the ocean, posing a potential threat to aquatic life.A team of scientists from Hull York Medical School and the University of Hull found 39 microplastics in 11 of the 13 lung tissue samples tested, higher than any previous laboratory tests. The study has been accepted for publication by the journal Science of the Total Environment.""Microplastics have previously been found in human cadaver autopsy samples - this is the first robust study to show microplastics in lungs from live people. ""It also shows that they are in the lower parts of the lung. Lung airways are very narrow so no one thought they could possibly get there, but they clearly have,"" said Dr. Laura Sadofsky, Senior Lecturer in Respiratory Medicine at Hull York Medical School and lead author of the paper.The study was conducted on living lung tissues as collected from surgical procedures carried out on patients who were still alive, as part of their routine medical care.Scientists have discovered 12 different types of microplastics which have many uses and are commonly found in packaging, bottles, clothing, rope/twine, and many manufacturing processes. The team said that they also found considerably higher levels of microplastics in male patients compared to females.""We did not expect to find the highest number of particles in the lower regions of the lungs, or particles of the sizes we found. This is surprising as the airways are smaller in the lower parts of the lungs, and we would have expected particles of these sizes to be filtered out or trapped before getting this deep into the lungs,"" Dr. Laura said.The study revealed the presence of 11 microplastics in the upper part of the lung, seven in the mid part, and 21 in the lower part of the lung ""which was an unexpected finding."" Researchers also found microplastics of the size and shape which are inhalable by humans.Researchers had earlier found these tiny plastic particles in the blood raising health concerns across the world. Earlier, scientists studying these tiny particles had detected them in the air surrounding Pic du Midi at an altitude of 2,877 meters in the French Pyrenees.",India Today Web Desk,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/scientists-discover-microplastic-stuck-deep-inside-lungs-of-living-people-1934702-2022-04-07

For now, in a simulator","European Space Agency has landed its astronaut on the Moon.At the moment, this successful lunar landing was done in a simulator, which Europe hopes to turn into a real event in the coming years as Artemis soars to the lunar surface. Italian astronaut Roberto Vittori conducted the test landing on the heavily cratered surface mired in shadows on the lunar south pole.The astronaut used the advanced flight simulator to try out a mock polar touchdown as part of a project to design a ‘human-in-the-loop’ lunar landing system. A veteran astronaut of six spaceflights, Vittori jumped into a unique motion simulator based at the German Aerospace Center at Oberpfaffenhofen.The simulator has been designed for extreme tilt angles and manoeuvres that could be a requirement when humans return to the Moon by the end of this decade. The simulator on the end of an industrial robot arm with a flight deck capsule attached to it is fitted in turn with a virtual flight deck window.“It was a beautiful run. The simulator is an incredible machine, probably one of the best I have experienced. This experiment today is for me showing that Europe can play a key role in the future of exploration,” Vittori said after the simulation.The European Space Agency in a statement said that the astronaut was able to experience how a spacecraft behaves during critical flight phases and then take action to control it. He was put through different test scenarios to encapsulate the full process of the lunar landing, which included a scenario where the autopilot was set to land in a landing zone littered with boulders.""Vittori was able to intervene within a given time window and select a safer alternative landing site via touch screens. In another scenario, the autopilot experienced a technical fault. Here, the Italian astronaut was able to switch to fully manual control and pilot the module manually as it descended onto the lunar surface,"" the space agency said.The primary goal of the simulation was to evaluate human-machine interfaces and assistance functions for spacecraft as the space agency establishes a preliminary design and the preliminary requirements for a human lunar landing, with astronauts in the loop to improve robustness and reliability of the flight system.Europe is already working on an intermediate station for crewed missions to the Moon dubbed Lunar Gateway.

Chinese researchers who helped draft the report also declined to comment.Beijing has already pledged to bring greenhouse gases to a peak ""before 2030"" and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.But its recent focus has shifted towards energy security, following disruptive power cuts as well as the geopolitical uncertainties brought about by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has also prompted countries like Germany to reconsider coal as a replacement for Russian natural gas.Economic stability has also been a growing concern, especially as the ongoing battle against new COVID-19 outbreaks stifles businesses and disrupts supply chains.Recent policy documents show China remains committed to coal as an energy source, at least in the short-term, with plans to start reducing consumption after 2025.""The language at the moment is for coal-fired power generation, and more accepting of it,"" said Jorrit Gosens, an ANU researcher on Chinese energy policies.In its latest energy five-year plan, China said ""advanced coal technologies"" would help the transition to green energy, with coal-fired electricity providing baseline power for renewable energy bases across the country.""They are saying it is necessary in order to allow growth in renewable energy,"" said Gosens.Another 33 gigawatts (GW) of coal-fired power capacity went into construction last year, and researchers estimate it could rise by 150 GW by 2025. read moreChina has pledged to raise wind and solar capacity to 1,200 gigawatts by 2030, but many think it could easily build more.Peter Newman, another author involved in the IPCC report, acknowledged that China had made big contributions to decarbonisation, driving down manufacturing costs for wind and solar, and working quickly to electrify transportation, but it had to show more ambition.""That is a sign of how commitment can occur, but it needs to extend right through China's economy,"" said Newman, who is from Australia's Curtin University.",Reuters,https://www.indiatoday.in/environment/story/china-energy-goals-a-problem-as-un-report-calls-for-deeper-coal-cuts-1934654-2022-04-07

The maiden launch of the SSLV, now delayed, will boost India as a major launch destination to deploy commercial satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO).Science & Technology Minister Dr. Jitendra Singh on Thursday said that EOS-02 is a technology demonstration satellite for various new technologies with applications that include agriculture, forestry, geology, hydrology, miniaturised power electronics, reaction wheels.The launch of the SSLV was initially targetted in the fourth quarter of 2021, however, due to Covid-19 induced lockdown, the development process was affected. Disruption in the domestic supply chain was a factor for the delay of spacecraft realization due to the non-availability of components, manpower, and facilities.The latest announcement comes weeks after Isro successfully conducted the ground testing of the newly developed solid booster stage (SS1) that will power its liftoff. The remaining stages of SSLV (SS2 & SS3) have successfully undergone necessary ground tests and are ready for integration.Isro had initially planned to launch SSLV in the first quarter of this year. The SSLV will provide a payload capability of 500 kilograms to a 500-kilometer planar orbit. By comparison, the PSLV — the workhorse of Isro — can take up to a 1,750-kilogram payload into SSO of 600 km altitudeThe government has sanctioned Rs 169 crores for the development of the project. This will cover the development & qualification of the vehicle systems and the flight demonstration through three development flights (SSLV-D1, SSLV-D2 & SSLV-D3).The minister also highlighted the findings behind the failure of the GSLV-F10 mission that launched with an Earth observation Satellite last year. ""Initial investigations with the post-flight data conducted immediately after the launch indicated that an anomaly in the Cryogenic Upper Stage led to the failure of the mission.

The flying observatory has now probed the atmospheres of two different planets, that are similar to Jupiter but are so close to their host star that they are being roasted at seething temperatures.The temperatures on these planets are so high that they are enough to vapourise even one of the strongest metals, like Titanium. While on one planet it's raining vaporized rock, the other has its upper atmosphere being sunburned by intense ultraviolet (UV) radiation from its star.Astronomers have in two different papers detailed the findings of these two mysterious worlds, which give astronomers new insights into the diversity, complexity, and exotic chemistry taking place in the far reaches of our galaxy.Astronomers observed WASP-178b using Hubble, located nearly 1,300 light-years away from Earth, where the atmosphere is enriched in silicon monoxide gas. In a paper published in the journal Nature, astronomers said that on the daytime side the atmosphere is cloudless, while on the night side of the planet the torrid atmosphere whips around super-hurricane speeds exceeding 2,000 miles per hour.The planet is tidally locked to its star, which means one side continuously remains facing the star similar to the Moon that remains locked with Earth. Astronomers said that On the dark side, the silicon monoxide may cool enough to condense into rocks that rain out of clouds, but even at dawn and dusk, the planet is hot enough to vaporize rock. ""We knew we had seen something really interesting with this silicon monoxide feature,"" said Josh Lothringer of the Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah.In another paper, published in Astrophysical Journal Letters, astronomers have detailed the findings of a super-hot Jupiter, KELT-20b, located about 400 light-years away. Using the Hubble, they observed that a blast of ultraviolet light from its parent star is creating a thermal layer in the atmosphere, much like Earth's stratosphere.While on Earth Ozone layer absorbs the ultraviolet rays of the Sun and raises temperatures in a layer between 7 to 31 miles above Earth's surface.

320,"April 7, 2022",10:17 IST,science, ,James Webb Telescope has its own fridge in space that will make it shiver at -266 degrees Celsius,"Hanging in the vacuum of space, nearly 15,00,000 kilometers away from Earth, the James Webb Telescope is cooling down. The Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) and other key equipment onboard the world's most powerful observatory are radiating heat into space. But, that's not enough to cool it down. Webb has its own high-tech refrigerator onboard.The cryocooler on the telescope is circulating cold helium gas on the MIRI optical bench, which will help cool it to about 15 kelvins or nearly -260 degrees Celcius. The cryocooler will redirect the circulating helium gas and force it through a flow restriction, and as the gas expands when exiting the restriction, it becomes colder, and can then bring the MIRI detectors to their cool operating temperature of below 7 kelvins, (-266 degrees Celcius).However, it's not going to be this simple as turning the valve and letting Helium flow. Nasa said that if the cooling is not immediately achieved, MIRI will start warming. If MIRI starts warming, it will raise a new challenge for the Webb team since MIRI’s detectors need to be colder to be able to detect photons of longer wavelengths.""MIRI will support the instrument suite to explore the infrared universe with depth and detail that is far beyond anything that has been available to astronomers to date,"" Nasa said. Scientists hope that the instrument will help reveal astronomical targets ranging from nearby nebulae to distant interacting galaxies with a clarity and sensitivity far beyond what we’ve seen before.All this depends on MIRI being cooled to a temperature below the rest of the observatory, using its own dedicated refrigerator.The instrument has been equipped with four coronagraphs, which have been carefully designed to detect exoplanets at temperatures similar to Earth. The detailed colours of exo-giant planets (similar to our own Jupiter) can then be measured by MIRI’s two spectrometers to reveal chemical identities, abundances, and temperatures of the gases of their atmospheres (including water, ozone, methane, ammonia, and many more).""Getting this instrument cold is one of the last major challenges faced by Webb before the MIRI team can truly relax, and passing through the cooler’s ‘pinch point’ will be the most daunting step in this challenge. At that time, the cooler will have pulled out almost all of the heat left in MIRI’s 100 kilograms (220 pounds) of metal and glass from that tropical launch day morning, three months ago,"" Nasa said.The James Webb Telescope had earlier made global headlines when it dropped the first images of a star that it saw to align its iconic golden mirrors in shape. The telescope is so sensitive that it not only captured the star but hundreds of distant galaxies in the background.",India Today Web Desk,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/james-webb-telescope-image-nasa-infrared-instrument-cryocooler-1934524-2022-04-07
321,"April 7, 2022",08:19 IST,science, ,18 nations have gone green on climate and kept economies growing: UN,"Proponents of clean energy and thinks tanks have long said it’s possible to reduce emissions and keep an economy growing. Now the latest report from the world’s top climate scientists says 18 countries have done just that, sustaining emissions reductions “for at least a decade” as their economies continue to grow.The United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) did not name the countries, citing inconsistency in the data.But using figures from Global Carbon Project, which are not part of the report, The Associated Press found 19 nations where the pre-pandemic annual carbon dioxide emissions were at least 10 million metric tons less in 2019 than in 2010. They are the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, Italy, Ukraine, France, Spain, Greece, Netherlands, Mexico, Finland, Singapore, Denmark, the Czech Republic, Belgium, Poland, Romania and Sweden.The IPCC identified three common factors for countries that have been able to decarbonize: They used less energy, transitioned away from fossil fuels to renewable energy and increased the energy efficiency of their products.Such countries “can export a model that shows we can reduce emissions and still have high levels of well-being,” said Greg Nemet, a professor of energy and public policy at the University of WisconsinMadison La Follette School of Public Affairs. ”We can export policies that have played a role in achieving that.”While the list of countries points a way forward, it also raises questions of equity. The United States, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom are among the largest contributors to historical carbon emissions. Their residents already have electricity and to a large degree, vehicles.Nemet, who is also a lead author of the IPCC report, added that developed countries that have been historical contributors to climate change and have been able to decarbonize need to take a “leadership” role in helping developing countries do the same.Historic emissions and discussions of responsibility are always discussed during U.N. climate conferences. But getting industrialized countries to agree on whether compensation for damages is warranted or how much they should pay to help poorer countries invest in green technologies, has all proved elusive.The least developed countries in the world are estimated to have emitted just 3.3% of global greenhouse gases in 2019, Inger Andersen, executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme, pointed out in a statement to the AP. Some experts note that developing countries often are forced to borrow money at higher rates of interest than developed nations, which can make large capital projects prohibitive.“The 18 countries that have balanced emissions reduction and economic growth are indeed examples that give us hope for the future but... all developed nations have a historic responsibility to ensure that they lean in whether on the Paris Accord targets of delivering $100 billion a year in climate finance, on ensuring poorer countries have access to technology and knowledge to make these shifts,” or by leading, making these transitions first, she said.Michael Grubb, a lead writer on the IPCC report and professor of energy and climate change at the University College of London, said in the report that scientists ran economic and emissions scenarios to see what would happen globally at different levels of carbon pollution reduction. In nearly every scenario -- including the “most aggressive” ones to cut carbon emissions -- the global gross domestic product still nearly doubled by mid-century. Even in the scenario with the deepest emission cuts, GDP jumped 96%, Grubb said.“The point is in practice, what we do in climate mitigation in macroeconomic terms is really going to be lost in the noise of the overall effectiveness of our economic policies,” he said.Grubb said the IPCC report declined to name the 18 countries because the data for some counted only carbon dioxide while for others included all greenhouse gases. Baseline years also differed. Depending on the parameters, there are more nations that reduced emissions while growing their economies, he said.Patricia Romero-Lankao, a senior scientist at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and lead author of the portion of the IPCC report on national and subnational policies, said she’s optimistic. But she stressed how much more must be done to aid disadvantaged communities and regions in decarbonizing and repairing the impacts of climate change.“This is not a technical problem,” she said. “We need to understand what they need, what challenges they face and how we can adapt our toolset to help us respond to that.”READ | IPCC to release key report on climate change today: What have previous reports found?",Associated Press,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/un-panel-ipcc-nations-green-on-climate-control-emissions-1934480-2022-04-07

The study also identified 42 new genes which had not previously been implicated in the medical condition.The new findings also confirm that proteins amyloid-beta and tau build up in and around nerve cells as the disease progresses. Scientists are hopeful that the findings can be used to identify people who are at the greatest risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease before they start to develop the condition.Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia and contributes 60-70 per cent of the cases. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), it is a syndrome in which there is deterioration in memory, thinking, behaviour, and the ability to perform everyday activities.Dementia is one of the major causes of disability among older people worldwide. The disease has a physical, psychological, social, and economic impact not only on people who are suffering from it but also on immediate families.In what is being termed the largest study of its kind included researchers analysing the genome of more than 1,00,000 people with Alzheimer’s disease and comparing them with more than 6,00,000 healthy individuals to look for differences in genetic makeup.Led by researchers, Dr. Rebecca Sims and Professor Julie Williams from the UK Dementia Research Institute (UK DRI) at Cardiff University, the study has been published in the journal Nature Genetics. ""Characterization of the genetic landscape of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (ADD) provides a unique opportunity for a better understanding of the associated pathophysiological processes,"" the paper said.The findings show for the first time that a specific biological signaling pathway involving TNF-alpha, a protein with an important role in inflammation and the immune system, is implicated in Alzheimer’s. Meanwhile, there is more evidence that the dysfunction of microglia, immune cells in the brain that are responsible for eliminating toxic substances, contributes to disease pathology.""Genetics has and will continue to help us identify specific disease mechanisms which we can target therapeutically. This piece of work is a major leap forward in our mission to understand Alzheimer’s, and ultimately produce several treatments needed to delay or prevent the disease,"" Professor Julie Williams of Cardiff University, co-author of the study said in a statement.As part of the study, researchers also devised a genetic risk score to determine how likely patients with cognitive impairment will, within three years of first showing symptoms, go on to develop Alzheimer's disease. However, they clarified that the score is not intended for use in clinical practice at present, but researchers hope it will improve the evaluation of new drugs in clinical trials.“This study more than doubles the number of identified genes influencing risk for the more common form of Alzheimer’s disease. It provides exciting new targets for therapeutic intervention and advances our ability to develop algorithms to predict who will develop Alzheimer’s in later life,” Dr. Rebecca Sims, Senior Research Fellow at Cardiff University, co-author of the study said.",India Today Web Desk,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/alzheimer-s-disease-dementia-genes-brain-disability-symptom-treatment-1934203-2022-04-06

""I still haven't found a clear answer.""""Going from a very small number of earthquakes to thousands is extraordinary,"" he said.The volcanic alert is at Level 4, meaning there is a ""real possibility"" the volcano could erupt. But when, where on the island and if it will actually happen are questions that remain unanswered, Fontiela said.So far, all the recorded earthquakes have been of tectonic origin and not volcanic, reaching a magnitude of up to 3.8. If they become volcanic, it means magma is on the move.The number of daily quakes has decreased in recent days but experts are not sure if that trend will continue.Ground deformation has already been detected, which is unusual given the tremors' tectonic origin and low magnitude, Fontiela said.According to Fontiela, the lack of previous studies about Sao Jorge is making it harder to understand the phenomenon.Geologist Jose Madeira said it was not clear what kind of eruption could take place, adding that previous seismic events in Sao Jorge in 1580 and 1808 were marked by deadly pyroclastic flows.Volcanologists also keep an eye on soil gases and earthquakes' depth. read moreThe Sao Jorge earthquakes are happening at average depths of 8-12 kilometres.

The Space Weather Prediction Center under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) has predicted a solar radiation storm on Wednesday and Thursday as the Sun spits filaments of plasma from a canyon that opened up on the surface on Sunday.The US-based space observer issued an alert for a minor geomagnetic storm in response to the anticipated arrival of the coronal mass ejection from the filament eruption that was centered near S22W30 on the Sun. The agency warned that there is a possibility of a Solar Radiation Storm occurring on Earth with proton levels exceeding the S1 (Minor) threshold.The geomagnetic storm is likely to extend to April 7, which could lead to fluctuations in power grids along with a minor impact on satellites in the Low Earth Orbit and kickoff auroras at higher altitudes. The geomagnetic storm could lead to minor radio blackouts.Geomagnetic storms are a major disturbance of Earth's magnetosphere that occurs when there is a very efficient exchange of energy from the solar wind into the space environment surrounding Earth.The latest source of the eruption is a location dubbed the canyon of fire, which, according to Space Weather, is a dark filament of magnetism that has opened up in the sun's atmosphere. The walls of the canyon are at least 20,000 km high and 10 times as long. Experts predict that fragments of the magnetic filaments may emerge from the blast site in the form of Earth-directed CMEs.The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory captured an asymmetric full-halo CME emerging from the blast site, while the bulk of the CME will miss Earth, and some of it will hit. ""A fraction of the storm cloud appears to be heading for Earth and could strike our planet's magnetic field on April 5th or 6th.

327,"April 6, 2022",11:29 IST,science, ,Zoos hiding birds as avian flu spreads in North America,"Zoos across North America are moving their birds indoors and away from people and wildlife as they try to protect them from the highly contagious and potentially deadly avian influenza.Penguins may be the only birds visitors to many zoos can see right now, because they already are kept inside and usually protected behind glass in their exhibits, making it harder for the bird flu to reach them.Nearly 23 million chickens and turkeys have already been killed across the United States to limit the spread of the virus, and zoos are working hard to prevent any of their birds from meeting the same fate. It would be especially upsetting for zoos to have to kill any of the endangered or threatened species in their care.“It would be extremely devastating,” said Maria Franke, who is the manager of welfare science at Toronto Zoo, which has less than two dozen Loggerhead Shrike songbirds that it’s breeding with the hope of reintroducing them into the wild. “We take amazing care and the welfare and well being of our animals is the utmost importance. There’s a lot of staff that has close connections with the animals that they care for here at the zoo.”Toronto Zoo workers are adding roofs to some outdoor bird exhibits and double-checking the mesh surrounding enclosures to ensure it will keep wild birds out.Birds shed the virus through their droppings and nasal discharge. Experts say it can be spread through contaminated equipment, clothing, boots and vehicles carrying supplies. Research has shown that small birds that squeeze into zoo exhibits or buildings can also spread the flu, and that mice can even track it inside.So far, no outbreaks have been reported at zoos, but there have been wild birds found dead that had the flu. For example, a wild duck that died in a behind-the-scenes area of the Blank Park Zoo in Des Moines, Iowa, after tornadoes last month tested positive, zoo spokesman Ryan Bickel said.Most of the steps zoos are taking are designed to prevent contact between wild birds and zoo animals. In some places, officials are requiring employees to change into clean boots and don protective gear before entering bird areas.When bird flu cases are found in poultry, officials order the entire flock to be killed because the virus is so contagious. However, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has indicated that zoos might be able to avoid that by isolating infected birds and possibly euthanizing a small number of them.Sarah Woodhouse, director of animal health at Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium, said she is optimistic after talking with state and federal regulators.“They all agree that ordering us to depopulate a large part of our collection would be the absolute last-ditch effort. So they’re really interested in working with us to see what we can do to make sure that we’re not going to spread the disease while also being able to take care of our birds and not have to euthanize,” Woodhouse said.Among the precautions zoos are taking is to keep birds in smaller groups so that if a case is found, only a few would be affected. The USDA and state veterinarians would make the final decision about which birds had to be killed.“Euthanasia is really the only way to keep it from spreading,” said Luis Padilla, who is vice president of animal collections at the Saint Louis Zoo. “That’s why we have so many of these very proactive measures in place.”The National Aviary in Pittsburgh — the nation’s largest —- is providing individual health checks for each of its roughly 500 birds. Many already live in large glass enclosures or outdoor habitats where they don’t have direct exposure to wildlife, said Dr. Pilar Fish, the aviary’s senior director of veterinary medicine and zoological advancement.Kansas City Zoo CEO Sean Putney said he’s heard a few complaints from visitors, but most people seem OK with not getting to see some birds. “I think our guests understand that we have what’s in the best interests of the animals in mind when we make these decisions even though they can’t get to see them,” Putney said.Officials emphasize that bird flu doesn’t jeopardize the safety of meat or eggs or represent a significant risk to human health. No infected birds are allowed into the food supply, and properly cooking poultry and eggs kills bacteria and viruses. No human cases have been found in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",Associated Press,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/zoos-hiding-birds-as-avian-flu-spreads-in-north-america-1934127-2022-04-06

As the Axiom-1 mission docks with the ISS joining European, American, and Russian crew, new technologies will be tested in zero gravity.The Axiom-1 crew will liftoff on Friday on a SpaceX Falcon-9 rocket to become the first private mission to stay and work on the Space Station in over three decades of its service beyond Earth. Nasa said that the Ax-1 crew will fly on a Crew Dragon to and from the space station on a mission dedicated to commercial research, outreach, and approved commercial and marketing activities.During their eight-day-long stay in the flying laboratory, the Axiom crew will conduct nearly 26 experiments in space, including the TESSERAE Ax-1 which tests the self-assembly and docking of an autonomous, self-assembling robotic swarm of tiles in microgravity. The investigation helps assess the feasibility of the construction of satellites and space habitats in orbit to support future missions to the Moon and Mars and space tourism in the Low-Earth Orbit.Apart from the TESSERAE Ax-1, astronauts onboard the flying outpost are testing Nanoracks-GITAI Robotic Arm designed by Japanese company GITAI Japan Inc that could lead to the development of robotic labour to support crew activities and tasks as well as servicing, assembly, and manufacturing tasks while in orbit. Nasa said that the technology has applications in extreme and potentially dangerous environments on Earth, including disaster relief, deep-sea excavation, and servicing nuclear power plants.Astronauts are also working on testing the feasibility of washing clothes in microgravity. Astronauts so far are forced to wear the same items of clothing and then replace them with new ones on resupply missions. Procter & Gamble Company (P&G) has now developed an experiment termed Tide Infinity, which is a fully degradable detergent formulated specifically for use in space. Space station crew members are involved in storing PGTIDE samples, flying to the station aboard SpaceX’s 24th commercial resupply mission (SpaceX CRS-24), and conducting stain removal activities.Apart from these, when the Axiom-1 crew docks with the Space Station, they will work on Modeling Tumor Organoids in LEO demonstrating processes for in-orbit pre-cancer and cancer cell culture confocal fluorescence microscopy, an important tool for biological research. ""The investigation seeks to develop models that could inform and accelerate the development of countermeasures and enhance crew safety on future space missions,"" Nasa said in a brief.When the Ax-1 private astronaut mission returns after spending 10 days in space, they will return with cargo and experiments from the Space Station. The most notable among those will be a harvest of chili grown completely in zero-gravity. As part of the PH-04 plant experiment, the harvest was performed by Crew-2 and Crew-3 astronauts as part of ongoing research to establish ways to grow food crops on long-duration space missions.Samples from the Aging and Heart Health study conducted during Ax-1 will also be returned that analyses human cells for genetic markers of cellular aging and explores how cardiac-like cells adapt to microgravity. Meanwhile, the private astronauts will also return an empty Nitrogen/Oxygen Recharge System (NORS) tank that supplies the needed gases to the station’s airlock for spacewalks.",India Today Web Desk,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/space-station-research-laundry-axiom-1-private-mission-nasa-roscosmos-1934115-2022-04-06

Nasa will attempt a wet dress rehearsal to ensure that a smooth launch is conducted or safely aborted in case there is a technical eventuality.The test was earlier stopped due to the loss of ability to pressurise the mobile launcher using two fans. The American space agency has said that the fans are needed to provide positive pressure to the enclosed areas within the mobile launcher and keep out hazardous gases.After the green signal to commence the test last week, Nasa had begun loading the Space Launch System (SLS) with the propellant that will power its rise after liftoff. But the plan was scrubbed following the detection of faulty fans.In spite of the issues, the Artemis team has managed to configure LaunchPad 39B and the mobile launcher for the test, just as it will have to be prepared for launch along with clearing personnel and equipment from the launch pad after configuration in order to proceed with propellant loading.The Artemis team in a blog update said that they powered up Orion and the SLS rocket systems in launch configuration, including the solid rocket boosters, the core stage, and the interim cryogenic propulsion stage. Engineers were also able to check out and verify the Orion spacecraft countdown and commanded by flight controllers at NASA Johnson Space Flight in Houston.In the upcoming tests, the Artemis team will work on draining the liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen after the test, powering down the rocket, the spacecraft, and ground systems, and putting them in a safe configuration. "" Completing these objectives will allow the team to use the next test opportunity to focus on executing the remaining objectives during dynamic operations, such as loading the cryogenic propellant and working through the launch countdown,"" Nasa said.Meanwhile, the team maintained that the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, the Orion spacecraft, and the supporting ground system elements are all in excellent condition and in a configuration that supports the next opportunity.The SLS had suffered a lightning strike last week while on the launch pad.

Action can prevent some of the worst if done soon, they say.After decades of trying to get the public’s attention, spur action by governments and fight against organized movements denying the science, climate researchers say they have a new fight on their hands: doomism. It’s the feeling that nothing can be done, so why bother. It’s young people publicly swearing off having children because of climate change.University of Maine climate scientist Jacquelyn Gill noticed in 2018 fewer people telling her climate change isn’t real and more “people that we now call doomers that you know believe that nothing can be done.” Gill says it is just not true.“I refuse to write off or write an obituary for something that’s still alive,” Gill told The Associated Press, referring to the Earth. “We are not through a threshold or past the threshold. There’s no such thing as pass-fail when it comes to the climate crisis.”“It’s really, really, really hard to walk people back from that ledge,” Gill said.Doomism “is definitely a thing,” said Wooster College psychology professor Susan Clayton, who studies climate change anxiety and spoke at a conference in Norway last week that addressed the issue. “It’s a way of saying ‘I don’t have to go to the effort of making changes because there’s nothing I can do anyway.’”Gill and six other scientists who talked with The Associated Press about doomism aren’t sugarcoating the escalating harm to the climate from accumulating emissions. But that doesn’t make it hopeless, they said.“Everybody knows it’s going to get worse,” said Woodwell Climate Research Center scientist Jennifer Francis. “We can do a lot to make it less bad than the worst case scenario.”The United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change just issued its third report in six months. The first two were on how bad warming is and how it will hurt people and ecosystems, with today’s report focusing on how the extent of disruption depends on how much fossil fuels are burned. It shows the world is still heading in the wrong direction in its fight to curb climate change, with new investments in fossil fuel infrastructure and forests falling to make way for agriculture.“It’s not that they’re saying you are condemned to a future of destruction and increasing misery,” said Christiana Figueres, the former U.N. climate secretary who helped forge the 2015 Paris climate agreement and now runs an organization called Global Optimism. “What they’re saying is ’the business-as-usual path ... is an atlas of misery ’ or a future of increasing destruction. But we don’t have to choose that. And that’s the piece, the second piece, that sort of always gets dropped out of the conversation.”United Nations Environment Program Director Inger Andersen said with reports like these, officials are walking a tightrope. They are trying to spur the world to action because scientists are calling this a crisis. But they also don’t want to send people spiraling into paralysis because it is too gloomy.“We are not doomed, but rapid action is absolutely essential,” Andersen said. “With every month or year that we delay action, climate change becomes more complex, expensive and difficult to overcome.”“The big message we’ve got (is that) human activities got us into this problem and human agency can actually get us out of it again,” James Skea, co-chair of Monday’s report, said. “It’s not all lost. We really have the chance to do something.”Monday’s report details that it is unlikely, without immediate and drastic carbon pollution cuts, that the world will limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times, which is the world’s agreed upon goal. The world has already warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit). And earlier IPCC reports have shown that after 1.5 degrees, more people die, more ecosystems are in trouble and climate change worsens rapidly.“We don’t fall over the cliff at 1.5 degrees,” Skea said, “Even if we were to go beyond 1.5 it doesn’t mean we throw up our hands in despair.”IPCC reports showed that depending on how much coal, oil, and natural gas is burned, warming by 2100 could be anywhere from 1.4 to 4.4 degrees Celsius (2.5 to 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, which can mean large differences in sickness, death and weather disasters.While he sees the increase in doom talk as inevitable, NASA climate scientist Gavin Schmidt said he knows first-hand that people are wrong when they say nothing can be done: “I work with people and I’m watching other people and I’m seeing the administration. And people are doing things and they’re doing the right things for the most part as best they can. So I’m seeing people do things.”Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann said scientists used to think Earth would be committed to decades of future warming even after people stopped pumping more carbon dioxide into the air than nature takes out. But newer analyses in recent years show it will only take a few years after net zero emissions for carbon levels in the air to start to go down because of carbon being sucked up by the oceans and forests, Mann said.Scientists’ legitimate worries get repeated and amplified like in the kids game of telephone and “by the time you’re done, it’s ‘we’re doomed’ when what the scientist actually said was we need to reduce or carbon emissions 50% within this decade to avoid 1.5 (degrees of) warming, which would be really bad. Two degrees of warming would be far worse than 1.5 warming, but not the end of civilization,” Mann said.Mann said doomism has become far more of a threat than denialism and he believes that some of the same people, trade associations and companies that denied climate change are encouraging people who say it is too late. Mann is battling publicly with a retired University of Arizona ecologist, Guy McPherson, an intellectual leader of the doom movement.McPherson said he’s not part of the monetary system, hasn’t had a paycheck in 13 years, doesn’t vote and lived off the grid for a decade. He said all species go extinct and humans are no exception. He publicly predicted humanity will go extinct in 2026, but in an interview with The Associated Press said, “I’m not nearly as stuck on 2026,” and mentioned 2030 and changes to human habitat from the loss of Arctic summer sea ice.Woodwell’s Francis, a pioneer in the study of Arctic sea ice who McPherson said he admires, said while the Arctic will be ice free by the summer by 2050, McPherson exaggerates the bad effects. Local Arctic residents will be hit hard, “the rest of us will experience accelerated warming and sea-level rise, disrupted weather patterns and more frequent extreme weather. Most communities will adapt to varying degrees,” Francis said. “There’s no way in hell humans will go extinct by 2026.”Humans probably can no longer prevent Arctic sea ice from disappearing in the summer, but with new technology and emissions cuts, Francis said, “we stand a real chance of preventing those (other) catastrophic scenarios out there.”Psychology professor Clayton said “no matter how bad things are, they can always be worse. You can make a difference between bad and worse... That’s very powerful, very self-affirming.”",Associated Press,https://www.indiatoday.in/environment/story/no-obituary-for-earth-scientists-fight-climate-doom-talk-1933762-2022-04-05
332,"April 5, 2022",14:11 IST,science, ,What measures UN IPCC report suggests to reduce emissions by 2030?,"While warning that the window to avoid the 1.5 degrees Celsius catastrophic rise in temperatures is fast closing, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) called for emissions reductions across all sectors. The panel pointed out that between 2010 and 2019 the average annual global greenhouse gas emissions were at their highest levels in human history, but the rate of growth has slowed.There is increasing evidence of climate action, scientists said adding, “We are at a crossroads. The decisions we make now can secure a livable future. We have the tools and know-how required to limit warming."" The panel on Monday released the report by Working Group-III aimed at mitigating climate change by reducing carbon from the atmosphere.“Emissions reduction to address climate change would need to be on the scale seen in the pandemic year after year, but in contrast with the adverse impacts of the pandemic, the options can actually improve quality of life,” IPCC Working Group III Vice-Chair Diana Urge-Vorsatz said.ASLO READ | New WHO data shows 99 per cent of world’s population breathes unhealthy airThe IPCC pointed out that limiting global warming will require major transitions in the energy sector, which include a substantial reduction in fossil fuel use, widespread electrification, improved energy efficiency, and the use of alternative fuels. Scientists said that limiting warming to around 1.5 degrees Celsius requires global greenhouse gas emissions to peak before 2025 at the latest, and be reduced by 43 per cent by 2030.The report identified that cities the urban areas provide enough opportunities to curb emissions, through lower energy consumption (such as by creating compact, walkable cities), electrification of transport in combination with low-emission energy sources, and enhanced carbon uptake and storage using nature.Meanwhile, reducing emissions in the industrial sector will require using materials more efficiently, reusing and recycling products, and minimising waste. It is to be noted that the industrial sector accounts for about a quarter of global emissions and achieving net-zero will be challenging. Similarly, agriculture, forestry, and other land use can provide large-scale emissions reductions and also remove and store carbon dioxide at scale, the 3000-page report said.“It’s now or never if we want to limit global warming to 1.5°C. Without immediate and deep emissions reductions across all sectors, it will be impossible,"" PCC Working Group III Co-Chair Jim Skea said adding that the global temperature will stabilize when carbon dioxide emissions reach net zero.Reacting to the findings of the report, the United Nations Environment Programme said that the world has the knowledge and technology to reduce emissions. It can be done through a rapid shift from fossil fuels to renewables and alternative fuels. ""Through moving from deforestation to restoration. Through backing nature in our landscapes, oceans, and cities. Through transforming our cities into green and clean spaces. And through behaviour change to address the demand side of the equation,"" the UN body said.",India Today Web Desk,https://www.indiatoday.in/environment/story/what-measures-un-ipcc-report-suggests-to-reduce-emissions-by-2030-1933749-2022-04-05

Tropical storms have winds of at least 39 mph (63 kph).Between two and four of the storms could be expected to hit the U.S.-regulated northern Gulf of Mexico, home to the nation's offshore oil and natural gas production and half of its refining capacity, he said.Warmer than average seas, which power storms, and the absence of an El Nino weather pattern that sends high winds across the southern United States to break up hurricanes are the primary reasons for Accuweather's forecast, Kottlowski said.""Unfortunately, we don't see the water temperatures cooling any time soon,"" he said.The 2022 Atlantic hurricane season officially begins on June 1 and ends on Nov. 30.As in 2021 and previous years, the season may get off to an early start with storms before the season officially begins, Kottlowski said.""The overall pattern looks pretty similar to last year,"" he said.The first storm of 2021 formed on May 22, 2021 and the last system dissipated on Nov. 7, 2021.

334,"April 5, 2022",12:52 IST,science, ,"Comet from interstellar space is coming to visit Earth, will never return once gone","After parts of India witnessed Chinese rocket fragments re-entering skies like meteors breaking apart, a comet is set to light up the skies in the coming month. C/2021 O3 (PanSTARRS) is approaching the inner planets of the solar system and is expected to cross the skies over Earth by May this year.Discovered in July 2021, the comet is currently flying behind the Sun when seen from Earth and is coming from the Oort Cloud, the most distant region of our solar system. The Oort Cloud is believed to be a giant spherical shell surrounding the rest of the solar system. It is like a big, thick-walled bubble made of icy pieces of space debris the size of mountains and sometimes larger.Cosmic snowballs of frozen gases, rock, and dust that orbit the Sun, comets are frozen leftovers from the formation of the solar system. According to Nasa, they range from a few miles to tens of miles wide, but as they orbit closer to the Sun, they heat up and spew gases and dust into a glowing head that can be larger than a planet. This material forms a tail that stretches millions of miles.Astronomers, while predicting the movement of the comet C/2021 O3, speculate that it might vapourise as it comes close to the Sun. If it survives, that's when it gets exciting.The comet is expected to hit the Sun on April 21, coming as close as 0.29 astronomical units (AU) from our star (1 AU = 1 average Earth-sun unit of distance).According to EarthSky, the comet will be at its closest to Earth on May 8, sweeping about 0.60 AU from us or 82 million kilometers from the planet.The comet was first spotted by astronomers using the Panoramic Survey Telescope And Rapid Response System, or 'Pan-STARRS' telescope. At the time of its discovery, the comet was 48 million kilometers from the Sun, putting it beyond the orbit of Jupiter. It was shining roughly 4,00,000 times dimmer than the faintest star visible to the eye.Astronomers said that it is the first time that this comet is visiting the solar system and has traveled millions of years to visit the inner planets. However, if it survives the Sun's gravity, it's never coming back and will remain floating in the Milky Way galaxy.As it passes close to our planet, while it will not be visible to the naked eye, it can be seen using binoculars. Since comets are very deceiving in their appearance thanks to their unpredictable nature of brightness, C/2021 O3's brightness could increase or decrease based on its interaction with the Sun later this month.The latest flyby of this comet comes months after Comet Leonard, the brightest comet that passed by Earth in 2021, disintegrated as it moved close to the Sun.

336,"April 5, 2022",11:25 IST,science, ,"Hubble spots a Jupiter still in the womb, showing violent nature of how planets form","Scientists have long debated the formation of planets in our solar system. While Earth was formed thanks to gravity pulling dust and matter together over billions of years, the birth of mega-planets like Jupiter and Saturn still remains a mystery. The Hubble Telescope, now, has pointed to a Jupiter-like planet that could hold the answer to the formation of giant planets in our universe.Described by scientists as ""still in its womb"", this enormous planet, about nine times the mass of Jupiter, is at a remarkably early stage of formation. Hubble has shed light on the ""intense and violent process"" at the center of this planet's formation surrounding a young star that’s estimated to be around 2 million years old.The planet is taking shape by a process called disk instability, where a massive disk around a star cools, and gravity causes it to rapidly break up into one or more planet-mass fragments.Dubbed AB Aurigae b, the Jupiter-like planet orbits its host star at a whopping distance of 8.6 billion miles over two times farther than Pluto is from our Sun.Researchers said that at that distance it would take a very long time, if ever, for a Jupiter-sized planet to form by core accretion. This leads researchers to conclude that the disk instability has enabled this planet to form at such a great distance.Using the Subaru Telescope located near the summit of an inactive Hawaiian volcano combined with observations of the Hubble, scientists found this planet embedded in an expansive disk of gas and dust, bearing the material that forms planets at a distance of 508 light-years - the distance light travels in a year from Earth.Planets in the process of formation - called protoplanets - have been observed around only one other star. ""Nature is clever; it can produce planets in a range of different ways,"" Thayne Currie of the Subaru Telescope and Eureka Scientific, lead researcher on the study said.A major help came from nature as the vast disk of dust and gas swirling around the star AB Aurigae is tilted nearly face-on to our view from Earth. ""Interpreting this system is extremely challenging. This is one of the reasons why we needed Hubble for this project a clean image to better separate the light from the disk and any planet,"" Currie added.""In the end, gravity is all that counts, as the leftovers of the star-formation process will end up being pulled together by gravity to form planets, one way or the other,"" "" Alan Boss of the Carnegie Institution of Science in Washington said.Understanding the early days of the formation of Jupiter-like planets provides astronomers with more context into the history of our own solar system.",India Today Web Desk,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/jupiter-formation-exoplanet-solar-system-hubble-telescope-saturn-gravity-1933664-2022-04-05

Four civilians will lift off on a SpaceX Falcon-9 rocket on Friday to become the first private astronauts to live and work on the Space Station as Nasa pushes for commercialisation of the flying laboratory.The first private astronaut mission, Axiom Space-1 (Ax-1) will launch at 11:17 a.m. EDT from Kennedy Space Center in Florida with four astronauts from three different countries commanded by a former Nasa astronaut. Astronaut Michael Lopez-Alegria will command the SpaceX Dragon Endeavour as it leaves for the flying outpost with Pilot Larry Connor and Mission Specialists Eytan Stibbe and Mark Pathy.The AX-1 mission will dock with the Harmony module’s space-facing port a day later in microgravity. The launch was initially scheduled for Wednesday. An Axiom spokesperson said that the delay would give SpaceX more time to complete pre-launch processing work.Lopez-Alegria, 63, is the Spanish-born mission commander and Axiom's vice president of business development. He is set to be joined by Larry Connor, a real estate and technology entrepreneur and aerobatics aviator from Ohio designated as the mission pilot. Connor is in his 70s but the company did not provide his precise age.Rounding out the Ax-1 team are investor-philanthropist and former Israeli fighter pilot Eytan Stibbe, 64, and Canadian businessman and philanthropist Mark Pathy, 52, both serving as mission specialists.Stibbe is set to become the second Israeli in space, after Ilan Ramon, who perished with six NASA crewmates in the 2003 space shuttle Columbia disaster.While the four astronauts have diverse backgrounds from three countries, a common thread remains that they are wealthy, similar to the millionaires club that has been flying on suborbital flights with Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic. However, commander Lopez-Alegria cleared, ""We are not space tourists.""The four astronauts will be involved in a wide range of research when they arrive at the Space Station and work to unravel the mysteries surrounding chronic pain and sleep disturbances during space travel, Spaceflight-Associated Neuro-Ocular Syndrome (SANS), which manifests through changes in visual acuity experienced by many astronauts on long-duration space flights.“The goal for the Ax-1 crew is to set a standard for all future private astronaut missions in terms of our preparation and professionalism,"" López-Alegría said. The Ax-1 team will be carrying equipment and supplies for 26 science and technology experiments to be conducted before they are slated to leave orbit and return to Earth 10 days after launch.While the space station has hosted visits by civilian visitors from time to time, the Ax-1 mission will mark the first all-commercial team of astronauts to use ISS for its intended purpose as an orbiting laboratory. They will be sharing the weightless workspace alongside seven regular crew members of the ISS - three U.S. astronauts, a German astronaut, and three Russian cosmonauts.",India Today Web Desk,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/axiom-space-ax-1-mission-space-station-nasa-private-astronaut-falcon-9-1933641-2022-04-05

The panel found that greenhouse gas emissions have been on the rise from the period 2010-2019 and it was 12 per cent higher in 2019 than in 2012.The panel looked at emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes, land use, and methane emissions. ""Net greenhouse gas emissions have increased since 2010 across all major sectors globally.

With emissions acting as the biggest villain, the climate panel will release details on reducing carbon dioxide levels from the atmosphere to prevent the planet from heating further.The IPCC prepares comprehensive Assessment Reports about the state of scientific, technical, and socio-economic knowledge on climate change, its impacts and future risks, and options for reducing the rate at which climate change is taking place.The global body under the UN has released two synthesis reports since last year that have given a stark warning of where we are headed if urgent action is not taken.In August 2021, the Working Group-I released the first set of findings under the Sixth Assessment Report, which stated that Earth's climate was reaching a tipping point. The panel warned of dangerous trends warning that Earth will hit the critical 1.5 degrees Celsius warming in two decades.Quantifying the likelihood of extreme events, the report said that for 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming, there will be increased heat waves, longer warm seasons, and shorter cold seasons. At 2 degrees Celsius of global warming, heat extremes would more often reach critical tolerance thresholds for agriculture and health.The future looks even grimmer, with more warming meaning more frequent extreme events. Should the world become 4 degrees Celsius hotter, as could happen in a high-emissions scenario, those heat waves would happen every one to two years. It found that further warming of the earth will amplify permafrost thawing, the loss of seasonal snow cover, melting of glaciers and ice sheets, and loss of summer Arctic Sea ice.The Working Group-II, releasing its findings in March this year, stated that 3.6 billion people are highly vulnerable to climate change. The panel said that climate change is likely to make the world sicker, hungrier, poorer, gloomier, and way more dangerous in the next 18 years with an “unavoidable” increase in risks.The experts reiterated that if human-caused global warming isn’t limited to just another couple tenths of a degree, an Earth now struck regularly by deadly heat, fires, floods, and drought in future decades will degrade in 127 ways with some being “potentially irreversible.” By 2050, a billion people will face coastal flooding risks from rising seas, the report says. More people will be forced out of their homes by weather disasters, especially flooding, sea-level rise, and tropical cyclones.The panel of more than 200 scientists puts out a series of these massive reports every five to seven years, with this one, the second of the series, devoted to how climate change affects people and the planet.",India Today Web Desk,https://www.indiatoday.in/environment/story/climate-change-global-warming-un-ipcc-report-emissions-wildfire-extreme-weather-heatwave-floods-1933330-2022-04-04
343,"April 4, 2022",13:55 IST,science, ,Jupiter has an identical twin. Einstein helps in finding this new world,"Known for its bright colours and dominated by a massive swirl of storm, Jupiter is a unique world in our Solar System. Astronomers have now found it's not alone and has a near-identical twin which is located at a similar distance from its star as Jupiter is from our Sun.Dubbed K2-2016-BLG-0005Lb, the exoplanet has been detected by an international team of astrophysicists using data obtained in 2016 by NASA's Kepler space telescope. The telescope has so far detected nearly 2700 planets in the Milky Way galaxy, but this Jupiter-like planet is twice as distant as any seen previously.Located 17,000 light-years from Earth, scientists used Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity and a method known as gravitational microlensing to spot this unique world as it temporarily bent and magnified the light from a background star.The study has been published as a preprint on ArXiv.org and submitted to the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.Led by Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics and PhD student, David Specht from The University of Manchester, the team searched through Kepler data collected between April and July 2016 when it regularly monitored millions of stars close to the centre of the Galaxy.""To see the effect at all requires almost perfect alignment between the foreground planetary system and a background star. The chance that a background star is affected this way by a planet is tens to hundreds of millions to one against. But there are hundreds of millions of stars towards the centre of our galaxy. So, Kepler just sat and watched them for three months,"" Eamonn Kerins, Principal Investigator for the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), who founded the project, said in a statement.Several teams had been scanning the same patch of sky as Kepler. However, the space-based telescope was faster in picking up the anomaly from its location nearly 135 million kilometres from Earth. Uninterrupted by weather or daylight, the Kepler telescope determines precisely the mass of the exoplanet and its orbital distance from its host star.It is basically Jupiter's identical twin in terms of its mass and its position from its Sun, which is about 60% of the mass of our own Sun, the team said adding that this was the first time the Kepler telescope had discovered a planet using Einstein's microlensing.""This event is the first bound microlensing exoplanet to be discovered from space-based data. Even though a space telescope is not designed for microlensing studies, this result highlights the advantages for exoplanet microlensing discovery that come from continuous, high-cadence temporal sampling that is possible from space,"" the team said in its preprint paper.The Kepler telescope was designed to survey a region of the Milky Way galaxy to discover hundreds of Earth-size and smaller planets in or near the habitable zone and determine the fraction of the hundreds of billions of stars in our galaxy that might have such planets. Working in deep space for nine years, before retiring, Kepler discovered planets from outside the solar system. Many of these planets could be promising places for life.",India Today Web Desk,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/jupiter-has-an-identical-twin-einstein-helps-in-finding-this-new-world-1933282-2022-04-04

Analysis of sound recordings shows that the speed of sound is slower on the Red Planet than on Earth. The sounds of Mars were recorded by the Perseverance rover trundling in the Jazero crater.The rover recorded its mechanical whining and clicks in the light Martian wind, the whirs of rotors on Ingenuity, the Mars helicopter, the crackling strike of a rock-zapping laser on the Red Planet. Scientists have now performed the first of its kind acoustic analysis of these sounds coming from Mars, revealing how fast sound travels through the extremely thin, mostly carbon dioxide atmosphere.The study published in the journal Nature provides a new method for engineers and planetary scientists to use audio recordings to probe subtle air-pressure changes in another world. “It’s a new sense of investigation we’ve never used before on Mars. I expect many discoveries to come, using the atmosphere as a source of sound and the medium of propagation,” Sylvestre Maurice, an astrophysicist at the University of Toulouse, lead author of the paper said.The Perseverance rover has been in the isolated world for over a year now, scooping samples from the surface to be returned to Earth in the future. Equipped with microphones, one on SuperCam, mounted on the head of the rover’s mast and the other on the chassis of the rover, it heard the mechanical clicks, pings, and even sounds of dust devils that blow on the planet.The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, that drives the rover on Mars, said that the microphone also reveals previously unobserved pressure variations produced by turbulence in the Martian atmosphere as its energy changes at tiny scales. Martian wind gusts at very short timescales were also measured for the first time.The sound team also analyzed the acoustics coming from the whirring of the helicopter at 2,500 revolutions per minute. The helicopter produced a distinctive, low-pitched sound at 84 hertz, an acoustic measure of vibrations per second, and the rotation rate for both rotors.Researchers found that on Earth, sounds typically travel at 343 meters per second. But on Mars, low-pitched sounds travel at about 240 meters per second, while higher-pitched sounds move at 250 meters per second. The variable sound speeds on the Red Planet are an effect of the thin, cold, carbon-dioxide atmosphere.Scientists also noticed that due to this thin atmosphere, sounds carry only a short distance, and higher-pitched tones carry hardly at all. On Earth, sound might drop off after about 65 meters, on Mars, it falters at just 8 meters, with high-pitched sounds being lost completely at that distance.When the microphones first began listening to Mars, engineers thought that the equipment had been damaged. Thanks to the extreme quiet on the Red Planet. Sylvestre Maurice said that one of the most striking features of the sound recordings is the silence that seems to prevail on Mars.“At some point, we thought the microphone was broken, it was so quiet,"" he added. Scientists said that this quiet is due to low atmospheric pressure on the planet. However, it changes with the seasons. Researchers are hopeful that with Autumn approaching, the Red Planet will become noisier and provide even more insights into its otherworldly air and weather.“We are entering a high-pressure season. Maybe the acoustic environment on Mars will be less quiet than it was when we landed,” Baptiste Chide of Los Alamos National Laboratory, coauthor of the study said.",India Today Web Desk,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/mars-sound-music-earth-acoustics-perseverance-rover-nasa-1933255-2022-04-04

The threat came after the United States, the European Union, and Canadian space agencies missed a deadline to meet Russian demands for lifting sanctions.""By this time, either the donkey will die, or the ISS will die by its own death. Nevertheless, the position of our partners is clear: the sanctions will not be lifted. At the same time, fearing the destruction of cooperation on the ISS, where the role of Russia is of fundamental importance to ensure the viability and safety of the station,"" Rogozin said in a tweet (roughly translated from Russian).Rogozin, known for his misadventurous statements, said Sanctions from the US, Canada, the European Union, and Japan are aimed at blocking the financial, economic, and production activities of Russia's high-tech enterprises.

The body had earlier released two sets of reports on the dangers of climate change and how the situation is going from bad to worse across the world.The third report will lay out a way forward for how governments can mobilize to accelerate mitigation action to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. The report will focus on assessing methods for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.In its latest report released in February this year, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said that if human-caused global warming isn’t limited to just another couple tenths of a degree, an Earth now struck regularly by deadly heat, fires, floods, and drought in future decades will degrade in 127 ways with some being “potentially irreversible.”More people are going to die each year from heat waves, diseases, extreme weather, air pollution, and starvation because of global warming, the report says. Just how many people die depends on how much heat-trapping gas from the burning of coal, oil, and natural gas gets spewed into the air and how the world adapts to an ever-hotter world, scientists say.Amid the pandemic and in the shadows of global conflict, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the Paris climate accord’s goal of capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) was “on life support” because countries aren’t doing enough to drive down emissions. With temperatures already about 1.2C higher now than before industrialization, keeping the Paris target alive requires a 45% cut in global emissions by 2030, he said.The reports have shed light on how climate change interacts with global trends, such as unsustainable use of natural resources, growing urbanization, social inequalities, losses and damages from extreme events, and a pandemic, jeopardizing future development.",India Today Web Desk,https://www.indiatoday.in/environment/story/climate-change-un-ipcc-report-global-warming-carbon-emission-greenhouse-1933184-2022-04-04

The Wet Dress Rehearsal will commence on Monday after it was initially stopped on Sunday due to the loss of ability to pressurize the mobile launcher using two fans.The American space agency is conducting key tests on the world's most powerful rocket ever built to ensure that the system is fit to take humans on a voyage to the Moon.In spite of the problem, the Space Launch System (SLS) core stage, interim cryogenic propulsion stage, and Orion spacecraft remained powered up overnight, while the boosters were powered down. Meteorologists with the US Space Force Space Launch Delta 45 currently predict favorable weather conditions for tanking operations.Earlier, Nasa had given the green signal to tank up the Space Launch System, which meant it could be loaded with the propellant that will power its rise after liftoff. Once propellant loading operations begin, liquid oxygen (LOX) and liquid hydrogen (LH2) will flow into the rocket’s core stage and interim cryogenic propulsion stage tanks, and be topped off and replenished as some of the cryogenic propellants boils off.However, tanking was scrubbed at the last minute due to a loss of ability to pressurize the mobile launcher. Nasa said that the fans are needed to provide positive pressure to the enclosed areas within the mobile launcher and keep out hazardous gases. ""Without this capability, technicians were unable to safely proceed with remotely loading the propellants into the rocket’s core stage and interim cryogenic propulsion stage,"" Nasa said in a blog update.The launch control team will now meet again and review the status of the operations before deciding if they will proceed with propellant loading.

It's forming new stars,"A team of Indian astronomers have discovered a faint but star-forming galaxy, which had so far remained undetected, hiding in front of a bigger, brighter galaxy. The galaxy with a ghost-like appearance shows hints of stars still forming within it and lies in our cosmic neighbourhood just 136 million light-years away.The galaxy was spotted by a team of researchers from the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bengaluru, along with international collaborators while studying a known interacting galaxy, NGC6902A. The first hints of the hidden galaxy came when astronomers noticed that the colour image of the southwest outer region of the galaxy NGC 6902A in the shows diffuse blue emission.These emissions were coming from young stars of types O and B, the most massive stars and also the most short-lived in the galaxy. This excess light prompted the researchers to investigate the peculiar feature in more detail to determine the cause of the interaction.The galaxy is classified by low surface brightness that is at least ten times fainter than the surrounding night sky, making it difficult to be spotted before. However, as optical telescopes become more and more powerful, they are capable of picking up this faint brightness being emitted from these galaxies. Researchers said that such faint galaxies may account for up to 15 % of the mass of the universe.Researchers measured the distance of NGC6902A, a previously known galaxy and the faint star-forming regions using emission lines in the spectra. They found that these star-forming regions are at a distance of around 136 million light-years, whereas the distance of NGC 6902A is around 825 million light-years. This means that the diffuse blue emission was from a foreground galaxy.Dubbed UVIT J2022, the galaxy was previously mistakenly thought to be a part of the interacting tail of NGC 6902A. Published in the journal ‘Astronomy & Astrophysics’, the study raises the possibilities that there could be similar diffuse galaxies that have been wrongly interpreted as interacting galaxies due to their superposition with foreground or background galaxies.The research was led by Jyoti Yadav, Mousumi Das and Sudhanshu Barway from India, along with Francoise Combes of College de France. Researchers said that the material that we see around us is known as baryonic matter. Cosmological studies suggest that baryonic matter should make up five per cent of the Universe's mass.The rest of the mass should be contributed by unknown forms, such as dark matter and dark energy. We still do not have a clear understanding about the five per cent of the baryonic content present in the Universe; we do not know where all the baryons are present. These faint galaxies can act as a link for understanding the origin of missing baryons in the universe.",India Today Web Desk,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/indian-astronomers-discover-a-galaxy-hiding-in-our-neighbourhood-its-forming-new-stars-1932433-2022-04-01

The disease is the reaction to eating gluten, which is a protein found in wheat, barley and rye.21-year-old Harnaz Sandhu was crowned Miss Universe at the 70th edition of the global pageant in Eilat, Israel in December last year. She has previously been crowned Miss Diva 2021, Femina Miss India Punjab 2019 and she also made it to the Top 12 at Femina Miss India 2019.Speaking to PTI, Sandhu revealed, ""I'm one of those individuals who was first bullied that 'she's too skinny' and now they bully me saying 'she's fat'. Nobody knows about my celiac disease. That I can't eat wheat flour and many other things.""Celiac disease is an outcome of over ingestion of gluten that causes damage to the intestine, and globally, affects 1 in 100 people. The condition occurs when eating gluten triggers an immune response in your small intestine, which over time leads to damages to the linings and prevents it from absorbing some nutrients.According to Mayo Clinic, intestinal damage often causes diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, bloating and anemia, and can lead to serious complications. In children, malabsorption can affect growth and development, besides causing the symptoms seen in adults.Health experts have also pointed out that the condition is hereditary and people with a first-degree relative with celiac disease (parent, child, sibling) have a 1 in 10 chance of developing the condition. According to Celiac Disease Foundation, it can develop at any age after people start eating foods or medicines that contain gluten.

355,"April 1, 2022",14:12 IST,science, ,We finally know what makes us. Researchers decode full human genome,"Scientists have finally done what was once considered improbable, but never impossible — decoding the entire human genome.Researchers have filled the gaps, completing an end-to-end sequence of the roughly 3 billion bases (or “letters”) in our DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), which is critical to understanding human genetic diversity. The development has the potential of unlocking ways to enhance human health.Since its initial release in 2000, the human reference genome did not cover the entire sequence leaving important heterochromatic regions unfinished, said the researchers whose study was published in the journal Science. About 92 per cent of the genome was fully known.Addressing the remaining 8 per cent of the genome, the Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) Consortium has now presented a complete 3.055 billionbase pair sequence. A genome is a chemical compound. It represents an organism's complete set of DNA. It contains all the information of the past evolution and codes for instructions needed to develop and direct activities to run the life of the organism.A set of DNA is made of two twisting paired strands, often referred to as a double helix. A unit of DNA containing particular set of attributes and information is called gene the word more commonly used by people to refer to hereditary matters.According to the National Human Genome Research Institute, each DNA strand is made of four chemical substances, called nucleotide bases. These bases carry what we call the genetic information. Each base is represented by one of the four letters A, T, C and G. They are arranged in pairs.Virtually every single cell in the body contains a complete copy of the approximately 3 billion DNA base pairs, or letters, that make up the human genome. With its four-letter language, DNA contains the information needed to build the entire human body.The full sequencing builds on the work of the Human Genome Project, which mapped about 92% of the genome. Researchers said that the last eight per cent includes numerous genes and repetitive DNA and is comparable in size to an entire chromosome.They generated the complete genome sequence using a human cell line with only one copy of each chromosome, unlike most human cells, which carry two copies of each chromosome.Each strand of the human DNA is made up of a pair of chromosomes, drawing one each from the parents. The Telomere to Telomere (T2T) consortium's full version is composed of 3.055 billion base pairs the units from which chromosomes and our genes are built and 19,969 genes that encode proteins.Of these genes, the researchers identified about 2,000 new ones. Researchers also spotted about 2 million additional genetic variants, 622 of which were present in medically relevant genes.“Ever since we had the first draft human genome sequence, determining the exact sequence of complex genomic regions has been challenging. I am thrilled that we got the job done.”“The complete blueprint is going to revolutionize the way we think about human genomic variation, disease, and evolution,” Evan Eichler, a researcher at the University of Washington and T2T consortium co-chair said.The work on decoding the human genome came to light more than 20 years ago. Researchers released the first set of the human genome sequence in 2001. However, it was just 85 per cent complete and 15 per cent remained hidden away. This 15 per cent turned out to be the most complex set of variations that have eluded scientists the world over for decades.The researchers came a step closer to the monumental discovery in July last year when a 99-member team of the consortium made the groundbreaking discovery by identifying about 115 new genes that code for proteins.The finding provided new insights into the workings of the DNA how it influences the risks of disease and how cells keep it neatly organised.Decoding the human genome opens up new avenues of research to enhance human health and find new ways to treat diseases and identify genetic diversities behind them.With the full genome sequence now available, researchers can create a more accurate map of chromosomes, and thus, of the DNA. They can find answers to basic biological questions about how chromosomes properly segregate and divide.It will be particularly valuable for studies that aim to establish comprehensive views of human genomic variation, or how people’s DNAs differ. Such insights are vital for understanding the genetic contributions to certain diseases, and the DNA’s response during fighting a disease, including a new one. This can become a routine part of clinical care in the future.""In the future, when someone has their genome sequenced, we will be able to identify all of the variants in their DNA and use that information to better guide their healthcare.”“Truly finishing the human genome sequence was like putting on a new pair of glasses. Now that we can clearly see everything, we are one step closer to understanding what it all means,” consortium co-chair Adam Phillippy said.",India Today Web Desk,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/human-genome-fully-sequenced-gene-editing-dna-chromosomes-medicine-1932311-2022-04-01

Not just on Earth, but in space","When humans return to the Moon and then push ahead deep in the universe in the coming decades, a major focus will remain on keeping them well fed to survive the dangerous challenges that space throws. An important component of their diet will include meat and keeping it consumable for longer periods of time will add to the challenge.Humans have already grown plants in space. Now it's time to step up and grow meat. The European Space Agency is pushing for more research in these labs grown meat options to feed astronauts on long-duration missions, and are hopeful that overcoming the challenge of growing meat in space could also help in improving the sustainability of this option on Earth as well.""If we want to succeed in long-term human exploration far from Earth, we need to rethink our current approach to astronaut nutrition and provide the means to efficiently produce food on board, possibly integrated within the regenerative life support system,"" explains Paolo Corradi, who was the first to propose the idea of feeding astronauts on long-duration missions with cultured meat.As part of the research, the teams will analyse and compare the nutritional value and potential benefits of cultured meat products with those of protein food alternatives for space applications. Based on the nutritional guidelines, the team will establish a set of requirements for growing meat in space for astronauts and select future human spaceflight missions.Paolo Corradi explained that the ESA will provide expertise in astronaut nutrition and human spaceflight to boost the research as teams will have to come up with a preliminary design for a cultured meat production system for space applications. ""They will compare the system with other potential onboard systems for protein food production, and with the current approach which involves food supplies being transported from Earth. They will also assess the potential commercial interest for a promotional demonstrator for both space and ground applications,"" he added.It is worth mentioning that meat production has long been held responsible for a major chunk of environmental problems, that has facilitated potential pandemic diseases, and causes suffering to billions of animals every year. The coronavirus pandemic is also speculated to have begun from a meat market in Wuhan.ESA said, ""with the global population growing and the demand for meat increasing, conventional meat production will become more and more unsustainable. Cultured meat could make conventional meat a thing of the past, but more research into the production technology is needed.""",India Today Web Desk,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/europe-plans-to-grow-meat-not-just-on-earth-but-in-space-1932340-2022-04-01
357,"April 1, 2022",13:36 IST,science, ,"After killer asteroid, mammals got bigger before they got smarter","In the aftermath of the asteroid impact 66 million years ago that doomed the dinosaurs, it appears that brawn was more important than brains for the mammals that managed to survive the calamity and conquer a changed world.Researchers said on Thursday an analysis of fossils of mammals from the Paleocene Epoch - spanning the 10 million years after the asteroid wiped out three-fourths of Earth's species - found that while their bodies got much bigger, their brain size relative to body mass actually declined.The findings contradict the notion that it was intelligence that drove mammals - bit players during the age of dinosaurs - to become the planet's new rulers following the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous Period.""The process to get large brains to emerge in mammals after the extinction was much slower than we previously thought,"" said Ornella Bertrand, a postdoctoral researcher in mammal paleontology at the University of Edinburgh and lead author of the study published in the journal Science.The researchers performed CT scans on fossils of 28 Paleocene mammal specimens and 96 from the subsequent Eocene Epoch, spanning 56-34 million years ago. They assessed brain size and the development of specific cerebral components. Brain growth, they found, kicked in during the Eocene, along with a change in the importance of various functions.""Contrary to our expectations, the mammals that survived the asteroid and outlasted the dinosaurs were fairly dim-witted. They didn't have near the brainpower of modern-day mammals - and keen intelligence came only many millions of years later,"" University of Edinburgh paleontologist and study co-author Steve Brusatte said.Mammals began to evolve greater body size almost immediately after the mass extinction that eliminated the dinosaurs, aside from their bird descendants. Before it, mammals typically were about the size of a shrew. During the Paleocene, some got as big as bears.""When the non-avian dinosaurs went extinct, an unprecedented opportunity became available for mammals, and they started invading the ecological niches left emptied by becoming bigger,"" Bertrand said.The researchers learned that the sense of smell - gauged by the development of the brain's olfactory bulbs - was crucial for Paleocene mammals as they seized new ecological roles. During the Eocene, other capabilities such as the greater integration of vision, hearing, memory and motor control - tied to neocortex development - became more critical for survival.""There is a cost associated in having a large brain. The energy allocated to the brain represents 20% of the entire energy allocated to the body. So, the evolution of large brains might only occur when the benefit of having a large brain outweighs the cost of maintaining it,"" Bertrand said.Mammals now boast the animal kingdom's largest brains relative to body size. Their Eocene brain growth occurred as competition for resources intensified and complex behavior became vital for species survival, Bertrand said. Some archaic Paleocene lineages disappeared, supplanted by mammals more like those living today.With dinosaur predators and plant-eaters gone, mammals began to fill these roles in the Paleocene, a time of evolutionary experimentation. Panther-sized Arctocyon, one of the mammals studied, bore large canine teeth and ate meat and possibly plants, too. Llama-sized herbivore Ectoconus, also studied, was heavily built with strong limbs and feet.The study focused on placentals, by far the most common mammals. Fossils unearthed in recent years in New Mexico, Colorado and France provided insight into Paleocene mammals.""Within 100,000 years after the extinction, species richness increased, and mammals rapidly became morphologically diverse,"" Bertrand said. ""Some Paleocene species were chunky overall, and quite different from the modern groups, while others lived in trees and may have been possible ancestors to primates - the group that much later includes humans. In the Paleocene, the mammals are doing their own thing.""",Reuters,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/after-killer-asteroid-mammals-got-bigger-before-they-got-smarter-1932319-2022-04-01

The team also collected data on a number of celestial objects visible only from Earth's southern hemisphere.Harmon said SOFIA has been mapping infrared observations for years and hopes the recent flights in Chile can help complete the study. The two-week mission in Chile started on March 18.""This mission here in Chile will help us conclude and finalize that proposal and hopefully produce a very important science paper on the Magellanic Cloud characteristics in the near future,"" Harmon said.NASA hopes that data about the Large Magellanic Cloud will help scientists better understand how stars are formed.SOFIA flies at an altitude of more than 45,000 feet (13,700 meters) at the edge of the atmosphere, which blocks most infrared rays. Once at the required altitude, the fuselage opens up so a telescope with a 8.2-foot (2.5-meter) diameter can observe the sky and start recording data that scientists analyze later.",Reuters,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/nasa-s-sofia-observatory-studies-neighboring-galaxy-from-chile-1932349-2022-04-01
359,"April 1, 2022",12:42 IST,science, ,Satellites confirm people in northern hemisphere emitted less carbon dioxide in 2020,"In a first of its kind study to identify human and natural emissions of carbon dioxide, scientists found fluctuations in atmospheric CO2 across the globe due to emissions from human activities.Scientists used a combination of satellites observing the planet to conduct atmospheric modelling and measure drops in CO2 emissions during the Covid-19 pandemic from space. Using the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2), scientists found that global CO2 levels dropped slightly in 2020.“Early in 2020, we saw fires in Australia that released CO2, we saw more uptake from plants over India, and we saw all these different influences mixed up. The challenge is to try to disentangle that and understand what all the different components were,” Lesley Ott, a research meteorologist said.Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a greenhouse gas present in the atmosphere and its concentration changes due to natural processes like respiration from plants, exchange with the world’s oceans, and human activities like fossil fuel combustion and deforestation. Its concentration has jumped nearly 49 per cent in the atmosphere, and can last in the atmosphere for up to a century after it is released, which is why short-term changes could get lost in the overall global carbon cycle.The OCO-2 tracked how human emissions shifted in response to climate policies, which are expected to produce small, gradual changes in CO2. The satellite has high-precision spectrometers designed to pick up even smaller fluctuations in CO2, and combined with the comprehensive GEOS Earth system model, were a perfect fit to spot the pandemic-related changes. The team’s results showed that growth in CO2 concentrations dropped in the Northern Hemisphere from February through May 2020 (corresponding to global emissions decrease of 3% and 13%).The team compared the measured changes in atmospheric CO2 with independent estimates of emissions changes due to lockdowns. In addition to confirming those other estimates, the agreement between emissions models and atmospheric CO2 measurements provides strong evidence that the reductions were due to human activities.The results represent a leap forward for researchers studying regional effects of climate change and tracking results of mitigation strategies, the team said. The method allows detection of changes in atmospheric CO2 just a month or two after they happen, providing fast, actionable information about how human and natural emissions are evolving.",India Today Web Desk,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/climate-change-carbon-emission-northern-hemisphere-co2-nasa-global-warming-1932288-2022-04-01
360,"April 1, 2022",12:06 IST,science, ,Online wildlife trade on rise in Myanmar: WWF,"A report by the World Wildlife Fund shows illegal purchases of wildlife online are growing in Myanmar in a threat both to public health and to endangered species.The report released Friday found that enforcement of bans on such transactions has weakened amid political turmoil following a 2021 military takeover.The number of such dealings rose 74% over a year earlier to 11,046, nearly all of them involving sales of live animals. For the 173 species traded, 54 are threatened with global extinction, the report said.Researchers identified 639 Facebook accounts belonging to wildlife traders. The largest online trading group had more than 19,000 members and dozens of posts per week, it said.The animals bought and sold included elephants, bears and gibbons, Tibetan antelope, critically endangered pangolins and an Asian giant tortoise. The most popular were various species of monkeys, often bought as pets.Most of the animals advertised for sale were taken from the wild. They also included civets, which along with pangolins have been identified as potential vectors in the spread of diseases such as SARS and COVID-19.Shaun Martin, who heads the WWF’s Asia-Pacific regional cybercrime project, said monitoring of the online wildlife trade shows different species being kept close together, sometimes in the same cage.“With Asia’s track record as a breeding ground for many recent zoonotic diseases, this sharp uptick in online trade of wildlife in Myanmar is extremely concerning,” he said.The unregulated trade in wild species and resulting interactions between wild species and humans raise the risks of new and possibly vaccine-resistant mutations of illnesses such as the COVID-19 that could evolve undetected in non-human hosts into more dangerous variants of disease, experts say.COVID-19 is one of many diseases traced back to animals. The killing and sale of what is known as bushmeat in Africa was thought to be a source for Ebola. Bird flu likely came from chickens at a market in Hong Kong in 1997. Measles is believed to have evolved from a virus that infected cattle.“Illegal wildlife trade is a serious concern from the point of view of biodiversity preservation and conservation and its potential impact on health security,” said Mary Elizabeth G. Miranda, an expert on zoonotic diseases and illness and CEO of the Field Epidemiology Training Program Alumni Foundation in the Philippines.Social media and other online platforms have joined a worldwide effort to crack down on the thriving trade in birds, reptiles, mammals and animal parts. In Myanmar, much of the trade in wildlife is through Facebook, which as a member of the Coalition to End Wildlife Trafficking online has taken action to block or remove accounts of people engaged in such transactions.But as is true elsewhere, new accounts often pop up just as soon as old ones are shut down, hindering enforcement, the report noted. Easy online access to the animals also is driving up demand, worsening the problem.Discussions of purchases of protected species often took place in open Facebook groups, suggesting that such dealings remain “largely risk-free,” the report said. Since payments and deliveries often are done using messenger apps, controlling the problem is doubly difficult.Highlighting the lack of enforcement, people in the illegal wildlife trade in Myanmar often use rudimentary methods of moving the animals and animal products around — with buses being the usual form of transport.The study by WWF in Myanmar focused on trade online of animals and other creatures inside the country, though there were some imports from neighboring Thailand, mainly of birds such as hornbills and salmon crested cockatoos, and of crocodiles, to India.Some deals might involve animals or parts being sent into China, it said.The conservation group said it plans future studies to better understand Myanmar’s role in the global trade in endangered species.",Associated Press,https://www.indiatoday.in/environment/story/online-wildlife-trade-on-rise-in-myanmar-wwf-1932244-2022-04-01

A wet dress rehearsal will be conducted to test the system before a launch date for the Artemis-1 mission is finalised. Nasa will test the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, Orion spacecraft, and Exploration Ground Systems to validate that all systems are fine-tuned and working as desired.The Artemis mission is one of the most ambitious missions undertaken by Nasa that will see humans return to the Moon, this time with plans for a longer presence and to push forward into deep space, with the first stop at Mars. ""Artemis I will provide a foundation for human deep space exploration and demonstrate our commitment and capability to extend human existence to the Moon and beyond prior to the first flight with crew on Artemis II,"" the American space agency has said.As part of the critical test to validate the Moon rocket's systems and designs, Nasa will load propellant into the rocket’s tanks, conduct a full launch countdown, demonstrate the ability to recycle the countdown clock, and also drain the tanks to give them an opportunity to practice the timelines and procedures they will use for launch.The agency said that during the approximately two-day test, teams will start by activating the facilities needed for launch and formally beginning the countdown sequence. They will practice a synergy between the rocket, the ground control, and the mission control for Artemis.More than 700,000 gallons of cryogenic, or super cold, propellants including liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen will be loaded into the tanks, and the Artemis team practice every phase of the countdown, including weather briefings, pre-planned holds in the countdown, conditioning, and replenishing the propellants as needed, and validation checks.""During the wet dress rehearsal, once launch controllers reach the point just before the rocket’s RS-25 engines will ignite on launch day, they will recycle back to the T-10-minute point, and then resume the countdown once more after a hold,"" Nasa said in a statement.Once the rehearsal is completed, the data will be analysed and the integrated rocket and spacecraft will be rolled back to the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB), where sensors specifically used for monitoring during the wet dress rehearsal, charge Orion and other system batteries, stow late-load cargo into Orion, and run final checkouts on several elements, among other tasks will be removed for analysis.Following the analysis, Nasa will release the date for the mission, when the Artemis lifts off for the Moon decades after the Apollo program was shut.

The trials are being done in 18 sites in six Indian states, of which two sites are in Pune-based NARI. If these vaccines prove to be effective, then, India will be the first in the world to create a vaccine for TB.The 1593 participants were enrolled through a randomised procedure and they will be followed for 38 months. Children above six years are also part of these clinical trials.“We are working as one of the sites for the ICMR initiative TB vaccine trials. The TB trial for vaccines will have two different vaccines and there will also be a placebo. We have already completed enrollments. It is being given to high-risk contacts of diagnosed TB patients, particularly those who have been diagnosed recently with their family members living in close proximity,” said Dr Sheela Godbole, scientist and nodal officer for communications at NARI- ICMR, Pune.With this, NARI is also evaluating shorter oral regimens for multi-drug resistant TB with medicines sans frontiers as collaborators.In one of the trials to evaluate Metformin when given along with regular TB treatment among adults with newly diagnosed sputum positive pulmonary TB, it was found that Metformin did not reduce the time required for sputum culture to become negative and hence was ineffective in the treatment of TB.Dr Godbole said there are a few studies that are being planned to identify cases in the community as well.Since NARI is predominantly an AIDS research institute, studies are being done to assess treatment of HIV to the occurrence of TB. In an ongoing study, factors associated with adherence among HIV infected patients attending ART centres are being studied.It has been found that there is deterrence of the development of TB among people living with HIV on anti-HIV medications at ART Center.NARI also plans to begin studies on viral load monitoring of people with HIV as well.",Milan Sharma,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/mission-end-tb-nari-icmr-moves-phase-3-trials-tb-vaccine-1932127-2022-04-01

In 2021, there were more than 50 severe flood events across the world, often triggered by extreme rainfall and coastal storm surges. read moreScientists long thought that more severe flooding along low-lying coastlines was driven only by the world’s rising sea levels, caused by climate change melting polar ice and warming ocean waters so they expand.But scientists found that, in northern areas of the United Kingdom, stronger and more frequent storms over the North Atlantic since 1960 led to more extreme storm surges, according to the Nature study released Wednesday. The increased storm activity was as much to blame for the increase in extreme storm flooding as was sea level rise.Around mainland Europe, however, calmer weather canceled out the storm surge impacts of sea level rise between 1960 and 2018.""Most countries assume that the likelihood of surge extremes will remain the same and only account for sea level rise,"" said lead author Francisco Calafat at the National Oceanography Centre in the United Kingdom. This may cause governments to underestimate future flooding, he said.If European countries do not adapt to increasing flood risks, they could face up to nearly 1 trillion euros ($1.1 trillion) in yearly damages by 2100, according to a 2018 study in the journal Nature Climate Change. The United Kingdom would be hardest hit, experiencing about a fifth of those damages.Understanding storm dynamics ""is essential for coastal planning and protecting near shore societies,"" said oceanographer Michalis Vousdoukas with the European Commission.",Reuters,https://www.indiatoday.in/environment/story/global-economy-lost-82-billion-due-to-floods-in-2021-study-1931871-2022-03-31

The Utopia region on Mars is characterised by craters in the planet's Northern Hemisphere and ice has been spotted lying both at and just below the surface, and at greater depths.With a diameter of 3,300 km, this area is just under twice the north-south size of Earth’s Sahara Desert. The Mars Express has now observed features on the surface that resemble patterns seen in the human brain.The latest image captured by Europe's Mars Express shows a slice of Utopia Planitia, likely to have formed as the basin was filled with sediments, lavas, and volatile substances transported by Martian wind and water in its ancient history. The image shows large, smooth patches of surface known as mantled deposits.The European Space Agency said that these are thick layers of ice and dust-rich material that have smoothed the surface and were likely deposited as snow back when Mars’ rotational axis was much more tilted than it is today. The two largest impact craters were captured by the spacecraft from above surrounded by double-layered mounds of material.Scientists observed that material on the second largest crater in the basin has become deformed and warped in a concentric pattern that resembles the complex patterns and ridges found on the surface of the human brain. ""Brain terrain is associated with the icy material found near the boundary between Mars’ northern plains and its southern highlands, a ‘dichotomy’ located to the south/south-west (upper left) of this scene,"" ESA said in a statement.Next to this brain-textured crater lies the dark-coloured region, created as the ice-rich ground contracted and cracked at low temperatures. This formed polygonal patterns and fractures that subsequently captured dark dust blown across Mars by wind, leading to the dark appearance seen here.The space agency speculated that these features are the result of ground ice either melting or turning to gas, which then causes the surface to weaken and collapse. Upon closer look, layered mantled deposits can also be seen in and around these scalloped depressions.Orbiting the Red Planet since 2033, the Mars Express has been imagining the surface, mapping its minerals, identifying the composition and circulation of its tenuous atmosphere, probing beneath its crust, and exploring how various phenomena interact in the martian environment.""The mission’s High-Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC), responsible for these latest images, has revealed much about Mars’ diverse surface features, with recent image releases showing everything from wind-sculpted ridges and grooves to geologically rich regions filled with volcanoes, impact craters, tectonic faults, river channels and ancient lava pools,"" ESA said.",India Today Web Desk,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/european-spacecraft-spot-complex-patterns-on-mars-similar-to-those-in-human-brain-1931867-2022-03-31

The Sun emitted a second solar flare in two days on late Thursday night. Nasa’s Solar Dynamics Observatory, which watches the Sun constantly, captured an image of the event.Classified as an X-Class flare, which is the most intense burst of energy and plasma, this eruption can impact radio communications, electric power grids, navigation signals, and pose risks to spacecraft and astronauts. The second solar flare was hurtled just hours after a geomagnetic storm from a previous Coronal Mass Ejection caused a radio blackout in some parts.""An X1 flare (R3 - Strong Radio Blackout) occurred at 1:37 pm EDT (1737 UTC) March 30. The flare source location was from the magnetically complex sunspot group, Region 2975,"" the Space Weather Prediction Center said in a statement. The agency added that the initial indications are this flare was associated with a new coronal mass ejection (CME) and SWPC forecasters are currently examining data to confirm any CME, and if verified, analyze further to determine whether there may be any Earth-directed component.The solar flares were released from the active regions 12975 and 12976 on the Sun on March 28. The Center of Excellence in Space Sciences at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Kolkata had said that as these flares strike Earth's magnetic field there is a possibility of coronal mass ejection induced by moderate geomagnetic storms.Geomagnetic storms are a major disturbance of Earth's magnetosphere that occurs when there is a very efficient exchange of energy from the solar wind into the space environment surrounding Earth. The largest storms that result from these conditions are associated with solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) where a billion tons or so of plasma from the sun, with its embedded magnetic field, arrives at Earth.These storms can add energy in the form of heat that can increase the density and distribution of density in the upper atmosphere, causing extra drag on satellites in low-earth orbit. The storm could trigger aurorasThe Sun is currently in Solar Cycle 25, which began in December 2019. A new solar cycle comes roughly every 11 years and over the course of each cycle, the Sun transitions from relatively calm to active and stormy, and then quiet again.",India Today Web Desk,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/geomagnetic-storm-hits-earth-sun-solar-flare-radio-blackout-nasa-isro-1931824-2022-03-31

Epidemics and locust infestations in the Horn of Africa. Severe floods in the Caucasus and Central Asia.

Egypt, meanwhile, was investing in modern irrigation techniques, education and health care.Georgieva said it was also critical to ensure climate adaptation policies were included in national economic strategies, as investments in resilient infrastructure and better flood protection could avert economic losses.In Morocco, for instance, simulations showed that beefing up water infrastructure improved resilience to droughts and cut GDP losses by almost 60%.She said public infrastructure investment needs could amount to 3.3% of GDP per year for individual countries in the region over the next decade, more than twice the average for emerging market economies.Given limited resources in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, countries would need a mix of domestic policy reforms, such as replacing fuel subsidies, and international support, including from the IMF, Georgieva said.",Reuters,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/climate-disasters-pose-major-growth-threat-in-middle-east-central-asia-imf-1931805-2022-03-31

The Die-Hard fame actor has been diagnosed with a medical condition known as Aphasia which leads to cognitive impairments, making it difficult to comprehend and express language.In an Instagram post, the 67-year-old actor's family announced that the medical condition is affecting his cognitive abilities. ""As a result of this and with much consideration, Bruce is stepping away from the career that has meant so much to him. We are moving through this as a strong family unit, and wanted to bring his fans in because we know how much he means to you, as you do to him,"" they said.The statement signed by Willis’ wife, Emma Heming Willis, his ex-wife Demi Moore, and his five children, Rumer, Scout, Tallulah, Mabel, and Evelyn further states, ""As Bruce always says, Live it up and together we plan to do just that.”A language disorder, Aphasia, is caused by damage in a specific area of the brain that controls language expression and comprehension. According to John Hopkins Medicine, the medical conditions leave a person unable to communicate effectively with others and are mostly found among people in middle to old age.The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders says that Aphasia usually occurs suddenly, often following a stroke or head injury, but it may also develop slowly, as the result of a brain tumor or a progressive neurological disease. ""Aphasia may co-occur with speech disorders, such as dysarthria or apraxia of speech, which also result from brain damage,"" it states.Health experts identify stroke, head injury, brain tumor, infection, dementia as some of the common reasons behind the development of the communication disorder.Willis’ family didn’t divulge what caused his aphasia.There are two categories of this medical disorder: fluent and non-fluent. People who are diagnosed with Fluent Aphasia suffer from damage to the temporal lobe of the brain that causes them to speak in long, complete sentences that have no meaning, adding unnecessary words and even creating made-up words.Meanwhile, in Non-fluent Aphasia, people are diagnosed with damage to the frontal lobe of the brain and often have right-sided weakness or paralysis of the arm and leg because the frontal lobe is also important for motor movements. They may understand speech and know what they want to say, but they frequently speak in short phrases that are produced with great effort. They often omit small words, such as ""is,"" ""and"" and ""the"", the National Institute of Health states.Research over the years in the field has shown that there is a scope for improvement in these brain-controlled functions. Speech-language therapy, nonverbal communication therapies, and group therapies with families help in fast recovery. The National Aphasia Association recommends impairment-based therapies aimed at improving language functions and consists of procedures in which the clinician directly stimulates specific listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills as one such treatment.""Communication-oriented treatments, in part, assist the person in conveying messages and feelings with alternative means of communicating,"" the body says. Clinical researchers have been developing therapies focused on a specific area of language impairment such as retrieving verbs and formulating sentence structure.Renowned for films like “Die Hard,” “Pulp Fiction” and “The Sixth Sense,” Willis has in recent years churned out straight-to-video thrillers. The actor has already shot at least six more films due out in 2022 and 2023, including “Die Like Lovers,” “Corrective Measures” and “The Wrong Place.”",India Today Web Desk,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/bruce-willis-what-is-aphasia-causes-symptoms-treatment-1931751-2022-03-31

The Indian Space and Research Organisation (Isro) is set to launch Chandrayaan-3 to the Moon and the maiden mission to the Sun, Aditya L-1.The ESA said that its global deep-space communication antennas will provide essential support to both missions every step of the way, tracking the spacecraft, pinpointing their locations at crucial stages, transmitting commands, and receiving ‘telemetry’ and valuable science data.Isro had signed an agreement with its European counterpart in 2021 to provide technical support to each other, including tracking and communication services using the European ground stations.“Deep space communication is an essential part of any space mission. Ground stations keep spacecraft safely connected to Earth as they venture into the unknowns and risks of space. Without ground station support, it’s impossible to get any data from a spacecraft, to know how it’s doing, to know if it is safe or even to know where it is,” Ramesh Chellathurai, ESA Service Manager and ESA Liaison Officer for Isro said in a statement.The Chandrayaan-3 mission to the Moon is the successor of the Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft that unfortunately crash-landed on the Moon. The new mission will derive power from the crashed mission as it uses the Orbiter still functioning from the second mission.The mission comprises a lander and a rover, which will spend two weeks conducting scientific and technical operations on the surface.

It also addresses the emergence of pathogens like the coronavirus, which damage both lives and livelihoods.Delegates agreed to hold an interim meeting in Kenya’s capital, Nairobi, in June before a high-level conference known as COP15 in Kunming, China, at a still-undecided date later this year.“Biodiversity is securing our own survival on this planet. It is not a joking matter,” said Francis Ogwal of Uganda, a meeting co-chair. “Every day that you live as a human being is on biodiversity.”Ogwal cited the “close linkage” between biodiversity and climate change, saying “every time that governments are talking about mobilizing for climate change, they should be doing the same for biodiversity.”Advocacy groups and some governments have ambitions for a deal in Kunming that would aim to protect and conserve at least 30% of the world’s land, inland waters and oceans to help stanch habitat loss, the overuse of nature by people and businesses, and the emergence of pathogens that thrive off of environmental upheaval.Some faulted the lagging pace of progress.“With so little time to Kunming, parties have finally kicked the can to the end of the road,” said Greenpeace East Asia senior policy advisor Li Shuo. As president of COP15, “China should work out a contingency plan to deliver a complex package with quality and ambition,” Li added.The U.S.-based Campaign for Nature pointed to an emerging consensus on the 30% target and a growing recognition that the lives and livelihoods of local communities and Indigenous peoples should be better protected. Still it pressed for greater intensity from countries to find solutions to declining biodiversity.“Unfortunately, the negotiations in Geneva have not reflected the urgency that is needed to successfully confront the crisis facing our natural world,” said Campaign for Nature’s director, Brian O’Donnell. “Progress with the negotiations has been painfully slow, and the level of ambition with financing remains woefully inadequate.”He said donor countries should commit to “far more ambitious financing targets.”A key issue has been on repurposing and redirecting harmful subsidies that total $500 billion per year and can damage biodiversity.

Nuri blasted off but failed to fully place a dummy satellite into orbit, delivering mixed results for a test launch that represented a major leap for the country's ambitious space plans.In contrast to the Nuri's liquid-fuel design, a solid-fuel rocket such as the one tested on Wednesday would be simpler, less expensive to develop and manufacture, and faster to launch, the defense ministry said.Wednesday's test verified the large solid-fuel engine, fairing separation, stage separation, and upper-stage attitude control technology, which are essential technologies for space launch vehicles, the statement added.The ministry said it plans to eventually use the rocket to put a small satellite or a number of ultra-small satellites into low-Earth orbit in the future, and to later transfer some technology to the private sector to help revitalise the domestic space industry.",Reuters,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/south-korea-says-it-successfully-test-fired-first-solid-fuel-space-rocket-1931382-2022-03-30
379,"March 30, 2022",11:42 IST,science, ,Into the wild: Animals the latest frontier in Covid fight,"To administer this COVID test, Todd Kautz had to lay on his belly in the snow and worm his upper body into the narrow den of a hibernating black bear. Training a light on its snout, Kautz carefully slipped a long cotton swab into the bear’s nostrils five times.For postdoctoral researcher Kautz and a team of other wildlife experts, tracking the coronavirus means freezing temperatures, icy roads, trudging through deep snow and getting uncomfortably close to potentially dangerous wildlife.They’re testing bears, moose, deer and wolves on a Native American reservation in the remote north woods about 5 miles from Canada. Like researchers around the world, they are trying to figure out how, how much and where wildlife is spreading the virus.Scientists are concerned that the virus could evolve within animal populations potentially spawning dangerous viral mutants that could jump back to people, spread among us and reignite what for now seems to some people like a waning crisis.The coronavirus pandemic has served as a stark and tragic example of how closely animal health and human health are linked. While the origins of the virus have not been proven, many scientists say it likely jumped from bats to humans, either directly or through another species that was being sold live in Wuhan, China.And now the virus has been confirmed in wildlife in at least 24 U.S. states, including Minnesota. Recently, an early Canadian study showed someone in nearby Ontario likely contracted a highly mutated strain from a deer.“If the virus can establish itself in a wild animal reservoir, it will always be out there with the threat to spill back into the human population,” said University of Minnesota researcher Matthew Aliota, who is working with the Grand Portage Reservation team.E.J. Isaac, a fish and wildlife biologist for the reservation that’s home to the Grand Portage Ojibwe, said he expects the stakes to get even higher with the start of spring, as bears wake from hibernation and deer and wolves roam to different regions.“If we consider that there are many species and they’re all intermingling to some extent, their patterns and their movements can exponentially increase the amount of transmission that could occur,” he said.INTO THE WILDTheir research is meant to ward off such unwelcome surprises. But it carries its own set of risks.Seth Moore, who directs the reservation biology and environment department, recently almost got bitten by a wolf.And they sometimes team with a crew from the Texas-based company Heliwild to capture animals from the air. One chilly late-winter afternoon, the men climbed into a small helicopter with no side doors that lifted above the treetops. Flying low, they quickly spotted a deer in a forest clearing. They targeted the animal from the air with a net gun and dropped Moore off.Wind whipped at his face as he worked in deep snow to quickly swab the deer’s nose for COVID, put on a tracking collar and collect blood and other biological samples for different research.The men capture moose in much the same way, using tranquilizer darts instead of nets. They trap wolves and deer either from the air or on the ground, and trap bears on the ground.They knew of the young male bear they recently tested because they had already been tracking it. To get to the den, they had to take snowmobiles to the bottom of a hill then hike a narrow, winding path in snow shoes.When Kautz crawled part-way into the den, a colleague held his feet to pull him out quickly if necessary. The team also gave the animal a drug to keep it sleeping and another later to counteract the effects of the first.To minimize the risk of exposing animals to COVID, the men are fully vaccinated and boosted and get tested frequently.The day after testing the bear, Isaac packed their samples to send to Aliota’s lab in Saint Paul. The veterinary and biomedical researcher hopes to learn not just which animals are getting infected but also whether certain animals are acting as “bridge species” to bring it to others. Testing may later be expanded to red foxes and racoons.It’s also possible the virus hasn’t reached this remote location yet. Since it’s already circulating in the wilderness of Minnesota and nearby states, Aliota said it’s only a matter of time.LOOKING FOR MUTANTSClose contact between humans and animals has allowed the virus to overcome built-in barriers to spread between species.To infect any living thing, the virus must get into its cells, which isn’t always easy. Virology expert David O’Connor likens the process to opening a “lock” with the virus’ spike protein “key.”“Different species have different-looking locks, and some of those locks are not going to be pickable by the key,” the University of Wisconsin-Madison scientist said.But other locks are similar enough for the virus to enter an animal’s cells and make copies of itself. As it does, it can randomly mutate and still have a key that fits in the human lock. That allows it to leap back to humans through close contact with live animals, scientists believe.Although spillback is rare, it only takes one person to bring a mutated virus into the realm of humans.Some think the highly mutated omicron variant emerged from an animal rather than an immune-compromised human, as many believe. Virologist Marc Johnson of the University of Missouri is one of them, and now sees animals as “a potential source of pi,” the Greek letter that may be used to designate the next dangerous coronavirus variant.Johnson and his colleagues found strange coronavirus lineages in New York City sewage with mutations rarely seen elsewhere, which he believes came from animals, perhaps rodents.What scientists are most concerned about is that current or future variants could establish themselves and multiply widely within a reservoir species.One possibility: white-tailed deer. Scientists found the coronavirus in a third of deer sampled in Iowa between September 2020 and January 2021. Others found COVID-19 antibodies in a third of deer tested in Illinois, Michigan, New York and Pennsylvania. Infected deer generally have no symptoms. Testing in many other wild species has been limited or absent.“It’s possible that the virus is already perhaps circulating in multiple animals,” said virology expert Suresh Kuchipudi of Pennsylvania State University, an author of the Iowa deer study. If unmonitored, the virus could leave people “completely blindsided,” he said.CAN IT BE STOPPED?Ultimately, experts say the only way to stop viruses from jumping back and forth between animals and humans — extending this pandemic or sparking a new one — is to tackle big problems like habitat destruction and illegal wildlife sales.“We are encroaching on animal habitats like we have never before in history,” Aliota said. “Spillover events from wild animals into humans are, unfortunately I think, going to increase in both frequency and scope.”To combat that threat, three international organizations — the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, the World Organization for Animal Health and the World Health Organization — are urging countries to make COVID surveillance in animals a priority.In Grand Portage, Aliota’s collaborators continue to do their part by testing as many animals as they can catch.With icy Lake Superior sparkling through the evergreens, Isaac slipped his hand beneath the netting of a deer trap. A colleague straddling the animal lifted its head off the snowy ground so that Isaac could swab its nostrils.The young buck briefly lurched its head forward, but kept still long enough for Isaac to get what he needed.“Nicely done,” his colleague said as Isaac put the sample into a vial.When they were finished, they gently lifted the trap to let the deer go. It bounded into the vast forest without looking back, disappearing into the snowy shadows.",Associated Press,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/into-the-wild-animals-the-latest-frontier-in-covid-fight-1931312-2022-03-30

The Center of Excellence in Space Sciences at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Kolkata, estimates that a massive surge of energy and plasma will hit Earth on Thursday.Coronal mass ejection is one of the biggest eruptions from the Sun's surface that can contain a billion tons of matter accelerated to several million miles per hour into space. This solar material streams out through the interplanetary medium, impacting any planet or spacecraft in its path. When a really strong CME blows past the Earth, it can damage the electronics in our satellites and disrupt radio communication networks on Earth.The solar flares were released from the active regions 12975 and 12976 on the Sun on March 28. The Center said that as these flares strike Earth's magnetic field there is a possibility of coronal mass ejection induced moderate geomagnetic storms. "" Our model fit indicates a very high probability of Earth impact on 31 March with speeds ranging between 496-607 km/s,"" the center said in a tweet. (1 kmps = 3600 kmph).CESSI also flagged new sunspots on the surface of the Sun that could produce more flares in the future. ""AR12975 and AR12976 have magnetically connected and continue to be flagged as M/X class flare productive, with reasonable chances of producing an X class flare. AR 12978 is also now being flagged as flare positive,"" it said.The US-based Space Weather Prediction Center at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) also corroborated the observation and predicted a G3 class strong geomagnetic storm to hit Earth on March 31. It warned that surface charging may occur on satellite components, drag may increase on low-Earth-orbit satellites, and corrections may be needed for orientation problems. "" Intermittent satellite navigation and low-frequency radio navigation problems may occur, HF radio may be intermittent,"" Noaa said in a warning.AR12975 and AR12976 have magnetically connected and continue to be flagged as M/X class flare productive, with reasonable chances of producing a X class flare.

382,"March 30, 2022",10:49 IST,science, ,Delhi feels the heat: How does India measure heatwave and why temperatures that define it are so high,"The United Kingdom on Monday raised the temperature at which forecasters will declare a heatwave in an area as climate change makes these extreme weather events more frequent. The UK Meteorological office raised the thresholds in some counties from 27 degrees Celsius to 28 degrees Celsius threshold and in others from 26 degrees Celsius to 27 degrees Celsius followed by 25 degrees Celsius to 26 degrees Celsius in one.The decision comes in the backdrop of global warming intensifying the occurrence of these weather-related events. As the world grapples with heat waves, India is no different. The India Meteorological Department on Tuesday predicted a heatwave spell over Northwest, Central & West India for the coming four to five days.The IMD in a statement said that there could be a gradual rise in maximum temperatures by about 2 degrees Celsius over many parts of Central and East India during the next three days. The weather agency warned that heatwave could lead to moderate health concerns for vulnerable people and there is an increased likelihood of heat illness symptoms in people who are either exposed to the sun for a prolonged period or doing heavy work.A heatwave is defined when a region experiences predominantly high temperatures for a sustained period of time. The India Meteorological Department defines a heatwave as a condition of air temperature which becomes fatal to the human body when exposed. ""It is defined based on the temperature thresholds over a region in terms of actual temperature or its departure from normal. In certain countries, it is defined in terms of the heat index based on temperature and humidity or based on the extreme percentile of the temperatures.""IMD considers an area experiencing a heatwave if the maximum temperature of a station reaches at least 40 degrees Celsius or more for the plains and at least 30 degrees Celcius or more for hilly regions. A heatwave is also characterised if the temperature goes at least 4.5 to 6.4 notches up and if ts exceeds over 6.4 degrees Celcius above normal, the IMD classifies it as a severe heatwave.Meanwhile, when it comes to coastal regions, a heatwave is announced if the maximum temperature is 4.5 degrees Celsius or more than the normal temperature experienced in the area.IMD predicts heatwave based on synoptic analysis of various meteorological parameters and from the consensus guidance from various regional & global numerical prediction models.The heatwave threshold in India is high compared to what the United Kingdom has deemed fit to declare a heatwave, since India has tropical weather conditions where temperatures are generally high.Senior IMD scientist R K Jenamani told indiatoday.in that heatwave thresholds differ across the world based on the climatic factors experienced in those regions. ""Different countries have different climatic conditions, scoping capabilities and therefore, while in some countries it's high, in others it's low. The Indian sub-continent has a tropical climate with high temperatures. Therefore, in countries like India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka heatwave is declared at higher temperatures compared to that of the United Kingdom.""The senior scientist denied any plans for the weather agency to alter the heatwave threshold for the country in the coming times, even as he acknowledged that climate change is leading to extreme weather events across the world.The IMD in its latest projections has predicted a gradual rise in maximum temperatures by about 2 degrees Celsius very likely over many parts of Central and East India during the next three days. A rise in maximum temperatures by 2-4 degrees Celsius is very likely over Maharashtra during the next five days. The weather agency has also predicted severe heatwave conditions in most parts very likely over West Rajasthan, in some parts over East Rajasthan & West Madhya Pradesh on March 29, 30.While parts of North India and Central India, northeast India is likely to experience light to moderate rainfall duringthe next five days with a possibility of isolated heavy falls over Assam-Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh on March 31 and April 1.Maximum temperatures have been rising in Delhi and parts of the national capital region in the last couple of days, hovering between 39-41 degrees Celsius. However, the IMD said that for it to declare a heatwave or severe heatwave the temperatures need to be consistently above normal by 4.5 degrees.",Sibu Tripathi,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/heatwave-temperatures-india-imd-uk-threshold-climate-change-global-warming-1931001-2022-03-29
383,"March 29, 2022",18:46 IST,science, ,Leak in Earth's core brings us close to solving mystery of how our world formed,"The Earth has evolved over billions of years, however, the mystery of its formation remains shrouded. A leak in the core of the planet has now given hints about the formation of our world that begins with the Big Bang and the secret lies inside a solar nebula.Scientists have detected Helium-3, a rare isotope of helium gas, leaking from the Earth's core. This primordial gas was created shortly after the Big Bang and acquired from the solar nebula as the Earth formed. Scientists have now estimated how much of this gas is leaking, which was previously only seen in the middle layers, called the mantle.The detection of Helium-3 indicates that Earth has deep reservoirs of this element, but its locations and abundances remain uncertain. It is worth mentioning that helium-3 can be produced by some natural processes as well, such as the radioactive decay of tritium, however, this primordial element is made primarily in the nebula.The study published in the Journal AGU Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems states that volatile exchange during Earth's formation and evolution implicates the metallic core as a leaky reservoir that supplies the rest of the Earth with helium-3. ""Mainly produced by the decay of uranium and thorium, terrestrial Helium-3 is large of primordial origin, synthesized in the aftermath of the Big Bang (Bania et al., 2002) and incorporated into the Earth primarily during its formation,"" the paper said.The new research provides evidence of the formation of Earth in a solar nebula.According to Nasa, Nebula are made of dust and gases—mostly hydrogen and helium. The dust and gases in a nebula are very spread out, but gravity can slowly begin to pull together clumps of dust and gas. As these clumps get bigger and bigger, their gravity gets stronger and stronger.Eventually, the clump of dust and gas gets so big that it collapses from its own gravity. The collapse causes the material at the center of the cloud to heat up-and this hot core is the beginning of a star.The researchers modeled helium during early formation when the planet was accumulating helium and following the formation of the Moon, after which helium was lost. Scientists believe around 4 billion years ago, an object one-third the size of the Earth hit the planet that re-melted the Earth’s crust, allowing much of the helium to escape, which continues to this day.The team estimated that each year, about 2 kg of the rare gas helium-3 escapes from Earth's interior.""The core offers a possible reservoir for 3He because it is less vulnerable to large impacts compared to other parts of the Earth system, it does not participate directly in plate cycling, and it has remained mostly liquid over Earth's history,"" the paper said.The team is now trying to go deeper under the surface to explore the true nature of the leak and understand the formation of the planet.MORE ARTICLES FROM THE WORLD OF SCIENCE:",India Today Web Desk,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/leak-in-earth-s-core-provides-clues-to-mystery-around-how-our-world-formed-1930920-2022-03-29

The energy produced by the wind farm is equivalent to 3,07,600 tonnes of standard coal that would have been burned.According to CGTN, with a total installed capacity of 2 gigawatts, the project can provide 5.6 billion kilowatt-hours of clean electricity for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area annually. The Wind Farm, located in the coastal area of Shapa Town, south China's Guangdong Province has successfully managed to reduce 840,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.""The Shapa project employs top-of-the-line technologies that are used in offshore wind power projects globally,"" Wang Wubin, chairman of China Three Gorges Renewables (Group), told China Media Group. The wind farm consists of 315 offshore turbines, four offshore booster stations, and almost 1,000 kilometers of submarine cables.The wind farm is the first of its kind project in China that has an active anti-typhoon system, which can be remotely controlled with the help of satellites. The project has made inroads by supplying clean energy using submarine cables that can withstand harsh oceanic environments and resist corrosion, among other factors.""We have laid more than 770 kilometers of cables in total for the Shapa offshore wind project. We have also overcome a number of worldwide technical problems, such as manufacturing and quality control of super-large scale marine cables. Our team has mastered core techniques such as the large-size cable forming technology,"" Xia Feng, president of Orient Cable, told CMG.China is not alone in boosting offshore wind farms in a bid to produce clean energy amid rising concerns over global warming. India has agreed to develop three Sri Lankan wind farms on islets between the countries. A joint statement issued Tuesday after a visit to Colombo by India's foreign minister S Jaishankar said a memorandum of understanding had been signed to build the installations.The Biden administration in the US has also announced it will hold a wind energy auction for two areas off the coast of North and South Carolina in May as part of its plan to ramp up clean energy production. The sale notice includes several stipulations meant to boost the domestic offshore wind supply chain, including offering a 20% credit to bidders if they invest in workforce training programs or supply chain development.Offshore wind power in the United States has lagged European nations in deploying the technology. Currently, the United States has just two small offshore wind facilities, off the coasts of Rhode Island and Virginia, along with two additional commercial-scale projects recently approved for development.The Netherlands has also hinted that it will ramp up the building of offshore wind farms in the coming years, doubling the planned capacity by 2030.

385,"March 29, 2022",13:25 IST,science, ,"In detecting alien life on a faraway planet, methane may be the key","For humankind, evidence for life beyond Earth is unlikely to be as dramatic as an alien spaceship landing, say, next to the Eiffel Tower in Paris. It is more likely to come from telescope observations of a faraway planet bearing atmospheric chemicals suggestive of biological activity.Researchers on Monday said methane may be the first detectable sign of extraterrestrial life if discovered in the atmosphere of a rocky planet orbiting in the ""habitable zone"" - the area not too hot and not too cold for liquid water to exist on the planetary surface - around a sun-like star.Scientists are working to understand the indicators of life - biosignatures - that might be present in observations of planets in other solar systems, called exoplanets, knowing that increasingly capable telescopes soon will be available.The researchers, in a study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, showed that abundant atmospheric methane could be a persuasive sign of life in the right planetary context. Methane is an important trace gas in Earth's atmosphere, at less than 2 parts per million by volume.Unlike other potential biosignatures such as atmospheric oxygen, methane is one of the few gases that should be readily detectable using the James Webb Space Telescope, launched by NASA in December and due to become operational within months.""On Earth, the vast majority of methane is produced by life,"" said study lead author Maggie Thompson, a University of California, Santa Cruz graduate student in astronomy and astrophysics.Most of it is generated directly by life: methane-producing microbes in wetlands, rice fields or in the guts of large animals. Methane is also generated through human activities such as burning fossil fuels including coal and oil, which are remnants of dead organisms. The proportion of Earth's nonbiologically generated methane is miniscule.The researchers made a three-part case for methane as a promising biosignature.""First, it would be unsurprising for life elsewhere to produce methane. Even if the biochemistry of alien life was radically different to that of Earth's biosphere, methanogenesis is an obvious and easy metabolic strategy for any carbon-based life given the energy sources likely to be present on rocky exoplanets,"" said co-author Joshua Krissansen-Totton, a NASA Sagan Fellow in UCSC's Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics.Secondly, they said, methane would not persist for long in atmospheres of habitable rocky planets without constant replenishment, possibly by living organisms. On Earth, atmospheric methane is unstable - destroyed by the chemical effects of light - but has constant biologically-generated replenishment.Thirdly, they said, it would be difficult for nonbiological processes such as volcanism or chemical reactions in mid-ocean ridges and hydrothermal vents to maintain replenishment without leaving a ""fingerprint"" indicating the methane was not biologically generated.Gas-spewing volcanoes, for instance, would release carbon monoxide alongside methane, but biological activity tends to devour carbon monoxide and reduce its atmospheric concentrations. Thus, they said, nonbiological processes cannot easily produce rocky planet atmospheres rich in both methane and carbon dioxide, as on Earth, but with little or no carbon monoxide.Scientists are expecting greater insight into exoplanet atmospheres using Webb and other new telescopes, examining their chemistry as these distant worlds pass in front of their host stars from the perspective of Earth.Oxygen, more plentiful in Earth's atmosphere than methane, is another potential biosignature. It too is fed into Earth's atmosphere via biological processes - in this case photosynthesis by plants and microbes. But oxygen could elude Webb's detection.""Methane is not a hypothetical biosignature. We know life on Earth has been producing methane for essentially its entire history, and atmospheric methane concentrations may have been high on the early Earth, before there was oxygen in the atmosphere,"" Krissansen-Totton said. ""But it's important to note that the diversity of planetary environments elsewhere is probably vast, and there could be other non-biological methane-making producing processes that no one has yet considered.""",Reuters,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/in-detecting-alien-life-on-a-faraway-planet-methane-may-be-the-key-1930878-2022-03-29

The element is critical to development of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries that are seen as key to reducing climate-changing carbon emissions created by cars and other forms of transportation.Worldwide demand for lithium was about 350,000 tons (317,517 metric tons) in 2020, but industry estimates project demand will be up to six times greater by 2030. New and potential lithium mining and extracting projects are in various stages of development in states including Maine, North Carolina, California and Nevada.“Nobody really foresaw this huge spike in demand,” said Tim Crowley, vice president of government affairs for Lithium Nevada, a subsidiary of a company developing a mine in Thacker Pass, Nevada. “We owned the lithium space for a long time, and we forfeited it to China.”Much of the world’s lithium comes from South America and Australia, and China dominates the worldwide supply chain for lithium-ion batteries. The U.S. produces less than 2% of the world’s supply of lithium, although it has about 4% of the reserves. The largest reserves in the world are in Chile.Expanding domestic lithium production would involve open pit mining or brine extraction, which involves pumping a mineral-rich brine to the surface and processing it. Opponents including the Sierra Club have raised concerns that the projects could harm sacred Indigenous lands and jeopardize fragile ecosystems and wildlife.But the projects could also benefit the environment in the long run by getting fossil fuel-burning cars off the road, said Glenn Miller, emeritus professor of environmental sciences at the University of Nevada.“A domestic source has tremendous value. Then we can do things that only China is doing with production,” Miller said.Lithium — the lightest metal on Earth — was discovered by Swedish chemist Johan August Arfwedson more than 200 years ago. Since then, lithium and its compounds have been used in everything from psychiatric medicine to lubricating grease.But interest in lithium has exploded in recent years because of its use in rechargeable batteries for electric and hybrid cars, lawnmowers, power tools and more. Lithium batteries also power laptops and cell phones.The Biden administration has made a plan for half a million charging stations for electric vehicles a signature piece of its infrastructure goals. That effort, and the growth of electric vehicle companies such as Tesla, will require much more lithium to make batteries.The new lithium mining project closest to development is the one proposed for Thacker Pass by Lithium Americas. That northern Nevada mine would make millions of tons of lithium available, but Native American tribes have argued that it’s located on sacred lands and should be stopped.Construction could start late this year, said Lithium Americas CEO Jonathan Evans, noting that it would be the first lithium project on federal land permitted in six decades.Evans said there will likely be more U.S. attempts to extract lithium because of the rising demand. “It has been a small industry and it has grown quickly,” he said. “I do expect larger companies to enter the space via acquisitions or other means.”Australian-based Ioneer also wants to build a large lithium mine in Nevada, which the company says is expected to produce 22,000 tons (19,958 metric tons) of lithium — enough to power hundreds of thousands of electric vehicles annually.Lithium mining projects represent a challenge for environmentalists because they carry the promise of decarbonization in exchange for heavy impacts on ecosystems and local communities. Lithium mining could jeopardize water quality and ranching in some states, the Sierra Club has argued.The big challenge is making sure lithium mines are located in places where they do the least amount of damage, said Lisa Belenky, senior attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity.“It really is very site specific as far as what impacts it would have to the local species, water,” Belenky said. “Almost every energy project we look at for climate change has its own greenhouse gas footprint.”The drive for more domestic lithium has opened the potential for mining and extracting in states beyond Nevada. An Australian company called Piedmont Lithium wants to develop an open-pit mining project it has proposed for the Kings Mountain area west of Charlotte, North Carolina. The area was a major supplier of lithium from the mid-20th century into the 1980s, the company said.California’s largest lake, the salty and shrinking Salton Sea, is also primed to host lithium operations. Lithium can be extracted from geothermal brine, and the Salton Sea has been the site of geothermal plants that have pumped brine for decades. Proponents of extracting lithium from the lake said it would require less land and water than other brining operations.One project, led by EnergySource Minerals, is expected to be operational next year, a spokesperson for the company said. General Motors Corp. is also an investor in another project on the Salton Sea that could start producing lithium by 2024.Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, envisions that California’s lithium can position the state to become a leader in the production of batteries. He called the state the “Saudi Arabia of lithium” during a January address.Dee Dee Myers, a senior adviser to Newsom focused on business, said that lithium is an “increasingly critical resource” as California and the world pursue clean energy development to slow climate change impacts.The state has an opportunity to produce “epic quantities of lithium” given the resources around the Salton Sea, Myers said. But she said it wants to ensure lithium is extracted and produced sustainably.State government could play a role in regulating the extraction process. In 2020, California also created the Lithium Valley Commission to review and analyze incentives for lithium extraction. They must file a report with their findings by October.In Maine, Plumbago Mountain in the western part of the state has attracted mining interest. The mountain is “a potentially significant new lithium resource,” with a higher average lithium content than similar deposits around the world, according to a 2020 paper in the scientific journal Mineralium Deposita.However, Maine mining regulations could make it difficult to extract the lithium. The Maine Department of Environmental Protection is reviewing the possibility of quarrying for lithium at Plumbago at the request of the property’s owners, state mining coordinator Mike Clark said.Plumbago Mountain is the kind of site that could be significant for the U.S. as it seeks to fulfill its clean energy goals, said Alicia Cruz-Uribe, an associate professor of petrology and mineralogy at University of Maine.The country’s lithium reserves rank among the largest in the world, Cruz-Uribe said. “But the amount that we produce is peanuts.”",Associated Press,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/us-seeks-new-lithium-sources-as-demand-for-batteries-grows-1930812-2022-03-29

The American space agency said that the fiscal year budget would allow it to sustain global innovation leadership and keep it at the forefront of exploration and discovery by returning to the Moon with the Artemis program, among other efforts.Under the Joe Biden administration, the agency has placed the demand with a focus on Moon landings and sending humans to Mars by 2040, along with pioneering new Earth science missions. The new demand is nearly $1.93 billion, eight per cent over the 2022 budget that was approved by Congress.“Greater than a number, statistic, or fact is what the President’s budget request represents. It’s an investment in the businesses and universities that partner with Nasa in all 50 states and the good-paying jobs they are creating. It’s a signal of support for our missions in a new era of exploration and discovery,” Nasa Administrator Bill Nelson said.Stating that the money will be used to unravel the secrets of the universe from deep space to Mars to planets in our solar system, Nasa laid out several proposals under which the staggering budget will be used. The space agency in a statement said that the money will enable missions on and around the Moon through Artemis while preparing for Mars exploration.The agency wants $7.6 billion for deep space exploration as it plans to land the first woman and person of color on the lunar surface, deepen the scientific understanding of the Moon, and test technologies that will prepare for human exploration of Mars. $4.7 billion has been requested for Common Exploration Systems Development to support lunar missions including funding for the Orion spacecraft and Space Launch System (SLS).Nasa has marked $2.4 billion for Earth-observing satellites and related research to improve the understanding of climate change, while $1.4 billion for space technology research and development will support new technologies. To maintain the country's leadership in aircraft development, $970 million has been requested for aeronautics research, which includes $500 million to reduce aviation’s climate impact.With the Mega Moon rocket on the launch pad ready for wet dress rehearsals, Nasa officials have hinted that the first human Moon landing of the 21st century will happen by 2026 followed by another in 2028, 2029, 2030, and 2031. The human exploration plans for Mars will take a dip in the budget at $161 million compared to $195 million in 2022. Meanwhile, the Mars sample return mission has been pushed back as Nasa sets its eyes on developing two Mars landers.Meanwhile, the space agency is also planning to develop a commercial space station in Low Earth Orbit after extending the services of the International Space Station till 2030.

The first crew launch of the year for the Jeff Bezos-led company is poised to take six paying customers on a brief flight to space in the New Shepard spacecraft.Tuesday's launch was scrubbed citing high winds in the launch area of West Texas from where New Shepard will liftoff for a nearly 10-minute-long journey to the Karmen line about 100 kilometers above Earth before returning. The mission is the fourth crewed flight for the company that has been striving for a major chunk of the emerging space tourism market.""NS-20 is now scheduled for launch on Thursday, March 31. New Shepard Mission Operations has successfully completed Flight Readiness Review and the weather is the only remaining factor to get to launch,"" Blue Origin said in a tweet. The company added that astronauts are completing their training.""Due to forecasted high winds during launch and recovery operations on Tuesday, March 29, and Wednesday, March 30, the New Shepard Mission Operations team has made the decision to move the launch of NS-20 to Thursday, March 31,"" the Jeff Bezos-led company said in a statement.The launch is scheduled for around 6:00 pm Indian Standard Time now on Thursday.The first flight of 2022 for the company will have Marty Allen, Fary Lai, husband and wife duo Sharon and Marc Hagle, Jim Kitchen, and Dr. George Nield. This is not the first time the NS-20 mission has been delayed. It was initially planned to launch on March 23. However, the plans were canceled after American comedian Pete Davidson pulled out of the mission and Blue Origin decided instead to send Gary Lai, best known as the architect of the New Shepard system, including leading the team responsible for the design and development of many of the key safety systems on the Crew Capsule.The New Shepard spacecraft is part of the reusable system developed by Blue Origin similar to the SpaceX Falcon-9 that returns to Earth after launching the crew capsule. The spacecraft has so far flown 19 times in nearly two decades of its development, testing, and demonstration phase and in 2021, Jeff Bezos himself flew on the maiden crewed mission to showcase the agility and safety of the spacecraft.Blue Origin has been flying celebrities in a bid to garner more eyeballs for its spacecraft and, in the past, it has flown William Shatner, best known for his portrayal of Captain Kirk.

Starship's debut launch has been delayed for months by engine development hurdles and regulatory reviews.It also poses new challenges as the company learns how to maintain a fleet and quickly fix unexpected problems without holding up a busy schedule of astronaut missions.""We are finishing our final (capsule), but we still are manufacturing components, because we'll be refurbishing,"" SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell told Reuters, confirming the plan to end Crew Dragon manufacturing.She added that SpaceX would retain the capability to build more capsules if a need arises in the future, but contended that ""fleet management is key.""Musk's business model is underpinned by reusable spacecraft, so it was inevitable the company would cease production at some point. But the timing was not known, nor was his strategy of using the existing fleet for its full backlog of missions.Crew Dragon has flown five crews of government and private astronauts to space since 2020, when it flew its first pair of NASA astronauts and became the U.S. space agency's primary ride for getting humans to and from the International Space Station.After each flight, the capsules undergo refurbishment at SpaceX facilities in Florida, which the company calls ""Dragonland.""""There's lifetime cycle issues, where once you start using it the third, fourth, fifth time, you start finding different things,"" said retired NASA astronaut and former SpaceX executive Garrett Reisman, who now consults for the company on human spaceflight matters.""SpaceX is really good about identifying these issues quickly and then acting quickly to fix them,"" Reisman added, pointing to an investigation in 2021 in which SpaceX discovered and fixed within months a toilet leak aboard a Crew Dragon capsule that had flown humans twice.NASA has given SpaceX some $3.5 billion to help develop and subsequently use Crew Dragon for six flights to the space station. It added three more missions to fill in for delays with Boeing Co's BA.N Starliner capsule. Read full storySpaceX has flown four crews of astronauts to the space station under its NASA contract at roughly $255 million per flight. The company carried out a fully private mission last year with four passengers, including a billionaire entrepreneur who funded the flight, for a three-day trip in Earth orbit.At least four more private astronaut missions on Crew Dragon are planned with Houston-based space station builder and spaceflight manager Axiom Space, with the first so-called Ax-1 mission scheduled for April carrying four entrepreneurs to the space station to conduct scientific research.Musk, SpaceX's founder and chief executive, has focused intensely in recent years on the company's hasty development of a re-usable Starship, the centerpiece of Musk's aim to eventually colonize Mars.Like Crew Dragon, SpaceX's workhorse reusable rocket, the Falcon 9, and its more powerful variant Falcon Heavy are also refurbished after each flight, and not every component is able to fly to space more than once.""The goal is to get more and more like aircraft operations, where you can take the vehicle after it lands, fill it back up with gas and oxygen, and go again very rapidly,"" Reisman said.""Starship, if it achieves its design objectives, would be able to affordably replace everything that Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy and Dragon can do.""",Reuters,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/spacex-ending-production-of-flagship-crew-dragon-spacecraft-that-transports-astronauts-1930532-2022-03-28
391,"March 28, 2022",17:07 IST,science, ,Scientists find Arctic sinkholes big enough to swallow city blocks with six-storied buildings,"Climate change is causing changes on the poles that will be very difficult to recover from. Researchers mapping the area have found sinkholes being formed in the Arctic that are so big that entire city blocks with six-storied buildings could submerge in them. Worryingly, all these depressions have developed in less than a decade.The new developments were observed in the high-resolution bathymetric surveys in the Canadian Beaufort Sea that occurred from 2010 to 2019. The detailed survey has been conducted in the permanently frozen region of the Arctic that has largely remained inaccessible to humans. Nearly one-quarter of the land in the Northern Hemisphere is permafrost or frozen ground.Researchers from Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute have documented these dramatic changes indicating how the thawing of permafrost submerged underwater at the edge of the Arctic Ocean is affecting the seafloor. The study has been published in the National Academy of Sciences.“We know that big changes are happening across the Arctic landscape, but this is the first time we’ve been able to deploy technology to see that changes are happening offshore too,” Charlie Paull, a geologist at MBARI who led the study, said in a statement. They conducted repeated mapping of the seafloor with ship-based sonar and an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to a resolution of a one-meter (about three-feet) square grid, or roughly the size of a dinner table.Researchers in 2010 found a band of unusually rough seafloor terrain along a 95-kilometer stretch of the shelf roughly 180 kilometers offshore, along what was once the seaward limit of Pleistocene permafrost. Repeated surveys allowed researchers to begin to understand the processes creating the distinctively rugged seafloor terrain in the Canadian Beaufort Sea.Researchers documented the formation of new, irregularly shaped, steep-sided depressions. The largest was an oval-shaped depression 28 meters deep, 225 meters long, and 95 meters wide. These new terrains were attributed to intermittent seafloor collapse due to the gradual warming of the permafrost sediment frozen beneath the Arctic Shelf.“While the underwater sinkholes we have discovered are the result of longer-term, glacial-interglacial climate cycles, we know the Arctic is warming faster than any region on Earth. As climate change continues to reshape the Arctic, it’s critical that we also understand changes in the submerged permafrost offshore,” Charlie Paull added.The continuous thawing of these permanently frozen regions in the Arctic is not completely being attributed to climate change and rising mean sea temperatures from human actions. Researchers said that the changes being seen in the Arctic derive from much older, slower climatic shifts related to our emergence from the last ice age, and similar changes appear to have been happening along the seaward edge of the former permafrost for thousands of years.“We don’t have a lot of long-term data for the seafloor temperature in the Canadian Beaufort Sea, but the available data do not show a warming trend, which ruled out anthropogenic climate change driving the dramatic changes in the seafloor terrain. Instead, heat carried in slowly moving groundwater systems is driving these changes,” explained Paull.The team has also documented other seafloor features created by water from thawing permafrost.Researchers believe that a similar process must be going on in other permafrost regions of the world. ""These rapid changes to the seafloor demand our attention. We need to understand how the decay of relict submarine permafrost will impact the vast areas underlying the Arctic continental shelves,"" Paull added.",India Today Web Desk,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/climate-change-arctic-sinkholes-depressions-antarctic-polar-warming-1930526-2022-03-28

The team at Wyss Center for Bio and Neuroengineering, in collaboration with the University of Tübingen in Germany, have achieved the feat of showcasing a collaboration between medicine and technology.The study, which has been underway for over two years, shows that communication is possible with people who are completely locked in because of ALS. The participant in the study had advanced Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) a progressive neurodegenerative disease in which people lose the ability to move and talk.Published in the journal Nature Communications, the experiment demonstrated that the patient modulated neural firing rates based on auditory feedback and he used this strategy to select letters one at a time to form words and phrases to communicate his needs and experiences.""This case study provides evidence that brain-based volitional communication is possible even in a completely locked-in state,"" the paper said.The participant in the study was a man in his 30s who had been diagnosed with a fast-progressing form of ALS. Researchers said that patients with ALS can lose all muscle-based routes of communication as motor neuron degeneration progresses, and ultimately, they may be left without any means of communication.The team implanted 64 microelectrode arrays in the supplementary and primary motor cortex of the patient, which picked up brain signals that the participant had learned to generate by attempting different movements. The model maps the signals to mean either ‘yes’ or ‘no’. To reveal what the participant wants to communicate, a speller program reads the letters of the alphabet aloud.Using auditory neurofeedback, the participant is able to choose ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to confirm or reject the letter, ultimately forming whole words and sentences. Jonas Zimmermann, PhD, Senior Neuroscientist at the Wyss Center in Geneva said, ""Successful communication has previously been demonstrated with BCIs in individuals with paralysis. But, to our knowledge, ours is the first study to achieve communication by someone who has no remaining voluntary movement and hence for whom the BCI is now the sole means of communication.”Globally, the number of people with ALS is increasing and more than 300 000 people are projected to be living with the disease by 2040, with many of them reaching a state where speech is no longer possible. The study showed that with the involvement of family or caregivers, the system can in principle be used at home.The team is now working to improve the system that could be key for the CLIS ALS population and could one day help other people who have an impaired ability to communicate and move. Researchers in a release said that they are working on ABILITY, a wireless implantable BCI device designed to flexibly connect to either microelectrode arrays or ECoG electrode grids. This will allow the detection and processing of signals from either highly specific or larger areas of the brain.",India Today Web Desk,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/fully-paralysed-man-successfully-communicates-using-computer-interface-implanted-in-brain-1930462-2022-03-28

396,"March 28, 2022",12:04 IST,science, ,Indian astronomers reveal how eruptions from Sun evolve on their way to Earth,"A team of Indian astronomers have found that interactions between two different Coronal Mass Ejections (CME), powerful outbursts from the Sun, in space play a key role in their evolution as they travel towards Earth.The Sun has been known to hurtle powerful eruptions towards the planets in the solar system, including Earth. When these eruptions interact with the magnetic field of Earth, they have the tendency of creating geomagnetic storms capable of taking out power grids, communications networks, and satellites in Low Earth Orbit.Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) and flares are the largest eruptive phenomena in our solar system that are characterised by powerful outbursts of plasma and energy from the Sun releasing a massive amount of energy within seconds. Coronal mass ejection can contain a billion tons of matter accelerated to several million miles per hour into space. This solar material streams out through the interplanetary medium, impacting any planet or spacecraft in its path.Scientists have long been observing these events, trying to predict these phenomena so as to ready the infrastructure that can withstand these geomagnetic storms.A team of researchers from the Indian Institute of Astrophysics observed two such eruptions from the Sun in May 2013 and February 2014 from a circular ribbon structure on the Sun and followed it with data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA). The team used data from the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph, Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, and Ames Coronagraph Experiment (ACE) Laboratory to study the changes when two explosions interact in the vacuum of space.In a study published in the journal Research in Astronomy and Astrophysics/IOP, they said that CME-CME interactions played important roles in deciding the evolution of CMEs in the interplanetary medium and subsequently their effectiveness.""Our study demonstrates that the CME deflection and CME-CME interactions were the major reasons affecting propagation in the Interplanetary medium. We plan to analyze the CME observations of a series of circular ribbon eruptive flares in the future,"" Syed Ibrahim, the lead author of the paper said in a statement.Scientists found that the location of the CME in the solar disk is an important factor that decides its trajectory in the corona and subsequent evolution in the interplanetary medium. The eruption was highly deflected from the source region. After the main explosion, a huge part of the CME moved towards the north-east direction of the sun. Finally, only a small part of the CME propagates towards the Earth.They also concluded that the interactions between these two explosions may have led to the original CME losing a substantial part of its energy. ""Their analysis suggests that this CME became dissipated in interplanetary space. After traveling a certain distance, this CME associated Interplanetary CME, or ICME, mingled with the solar wind,"" the Ministry of Science & Technology said in a statement.",India Today Web Desk,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/indian-astronomers-reveal-how-eruptions-from-sun-evolve-on-their-way-to-earth-1930344-2022-03-28
397,"March 28, 2022",11:34 IST,science, ,How did vampire bats got a taste for blood? Answer hidden in their genes,"Scientists have figured out why vampire bats are the only mammals that can survive on a diet of just blood.They compared the genome of common vampire bats to 26 other bat species and identified 13 genes that are missing or no longer work in vampire bats. Over the years, those gene tweaks helped them adapt to a blood diet rich in iron and protein but with minimal fats or carbohydrates, the researchers reported Friday in the journal Science Advances.The bats live in South and Central America and are basically “living Draculas,” said co-author Michael Hiller of Germany’s Max Planck Institute. About 3 inches (8 centimeters) long with a wingspan of 7 inches (18 centimeters), the bats bite and than lap up blood from livestock or other animals at night.Most mammals couldn’t survive on a low-calorie liquid diet of blood. Only three vampire species of the 1,400 kinds of bats can do that — the others eat mostly insects, fruit, nectar, pollen or meat, such as small frogs and fish.“Blood is a terrible food source,” said Hannah Kim Frank, a bat researcher at Tulane University, who was not involved in the study. “It’s totally bizarre and amazing that vampire bats can survive on blood — they are really weird, even among bats.”Some other creatures also have a taste for blood, including mosquitoes, bedbugs, leeches and fleas.The latest work expands upon research by another team that pinpointed three of the 13 gene losses.“The new paper shows how different vampire bats are from even other closely related bats, which eat nectar and fruit,” said Kate Langwig, a bat researcher at Virginia Tech, who had no role in the study.With such a low-calorie diet, vampire bats can’t go long without a meal. In a pinch, well-fed ones will regurgitate their food to share with a starving neighbor. They seem to keep track of who has helped them in the past, said Hiller, noting that vampire bats have complex social relationships.“It’s not a kin thing,” said Tulane’s Frank. “They just notice and remember: You’re a good sharer, I will reward you.”",Associated Press,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/how-did-vampire-bats-got-a-taste-for-blood-answer-hidden-in-their-genes-1930329-2022-03-28

Researchers have said that people who were hospitalised with coronavirus should be routinely checked for flu as a study shows having the two more than doubles the risk of death.In a study published in the medical journal Lancet, researchers have tried to understand the clinical outcome of respiratory viral co-infections with SARS-CoV-2. ""SARS-CoV-2 co-infections with influenza viruses and adenoviruses were each significantly associated with increased odds of death,"" the paper said.Scientists also discovered that people who had contacted both coronavirus and the influenza viruses were 2.4 times at the risk of dying than if they just had Covid-19. The study hints that these patients are over four times more likely to require ventilation support post-hospitalisation to keep them breathing.“We found that the combination of Covid-19 and flu viruses is particularly dangerous. We expect that Covid-19 will circulate with flu, increasing the chance of co-infections. That is why we should change our testing strategy for Covid-19 patients in hospital and test for flu much more widely,” Professor Kenneth Baillie of Edinburgh University told The Guardian.The study was conducted among 2,12,466 adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection who were admitted to a hospital in the UK between February 6, 2020, and December 8, 2021. While viral co-infection was detected in 583 patients, 227 patients had influenza viruses, 220 patients had a respiratory syncytial virus, and 136 patients had adenoviruses.Researchers said that it is the largest study of people with Covid-19 undergoing additional testing for endemic respiratory viruses, reporting 583 confirmed co-infections and 6382 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 mono infections. The study was conducted over a prolonged period of 18 months.The team of researchers from Edinburgh University, Liverpool University, Imperial College London, and Leiden University in the Netherlands urged people to get vaccinated and booster shots in a bid to protect themselves from coronavirus. “The vaccines that protect against Covid-19 and flu are different, and people need both. ""The way that these two infections are treated is also different, so it’s important to test for other viruses even when you have a diagnosis in someone who is hospitalised with a respiratory infection,” Professor Peter Openshaw of Imperial College London told Tha Guardian.Meanwhile, scientists now believe that Covid-19 patients suffer more than respiratory issues. Several studies have revealed that the virus can also damage the heart. A September 2020 study found that the risk of a first heart attack increased by three to eight times in the first week after a Covid-19 infection was diagnosed.The new study comes in the backdrop of a new surge being observed in some countries including China and South Korea.",India Today Web Desk,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/patients-with-both-covid-19-and-flu-at-double-the-risk-of-dying-study-1930324-2022-03-28

Now scientists have detected a new wave that has a much faster speed than what astronomers had expected theoretically.The high-frequency-retrograde vorticity waves in the Sun move in the opposite direction of the Sun’s rotation - appear as a pattern of vortices (swirling motions) on the surface of the Sun. Scientists observed it to be moving at three times the speed established by the current theory.In a study published in the journal Nature Astronomy, solar physicists detailed how they analyzed 25 years of space and ground-based data to detect these waves. ""We investigate three possibilities: that these vorticity waves are excited by the Coriolis force and modified by internal magnetic fields, gravity or compressibility,"" the paper said.“The very existence of HFR modes and their origin is a true mystery and may allude to exciting physics at play. It has the potential to shed insight on the otherwise unobservable interior of the Sun,” Shravan Hanasoge, a co-author of the paper said in a statement.Scientists have long been puzzled by the surface of the Sun and its atmosphere and the difference in temperatures between these two regions. The interior of the Sun and stars cannot be imaged by conventional astronomy, which forces astronomers to rely on interpreting the surface signatures of a variety of waves to image the interior.Complex interactions between other well-known waves and magnetism, gravity, or convection could drive the HFR waves at this speed. Researchers said that If the HFR waves could be attributed to any of these three processes, then the finding would have answered some open questions we still have about the Sun. ""However, these new waves don’t appear to be a result of these processes, and that’s exciting because it leads to a whole new set of questions,” Hanson said.""These new HFR waves may yet be an important puzzle piece in our understanding of stars,"" researchers said in a statement. The study was conducted at the Center for Space Science in collaboration with the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) and New York University.By studying the Sun’s interior dynamics - through the use of waves - scientists hope to better understand the Sun's potential impact on the Earth and other planets in our solar system.",India Today Web Desk,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/astronomers-discover-mysterious-new-wave-on-sun-that-travels-faster-than-expectation-1930301-2022-03-28

We now have answers,"In August last year, India was poised to get the third Earth Observation Satellite, when after 26 hours of the countdown, the GSLV-F10 mission lifted off - but never reached its destination in space. Isro lost the mission just 297.3 seconds after lift-off to a ""technical anomaly"", which it now says was due to a deviation in performance of the Cryogenic Upper Stage (CUS) of the launch vehicle.The Failure Analysis Committee set up by the Indian space agency in its report has said that subsequent to lift-off the build-up of pressure in the propellant (Liquid Hydrogen or LH2) tank during the flight was not normal leading to a lower tank pressure at the time of ignition of the engine.This led to an insufficient flow of Liquid Hydrogen into the engine thrust chamber and the reduction in LH2 tank pressure was due to a leak in the respective Vent and Relief Valve (VRV), which is used for relieving the excess tank pressure during flight. Isro said that computer simulations as well as multiple confirmatory ground tests, closely simulating the conditions in the GSLV-F10 flight, validated the analysis by the FAC.""The FAC concluded that the lower LH2 tank pressure at the time of CUS engine ignition, caused by the leakage of Vent & Relief Valve (VRV) resulted in the malfunctioning of the Fuel Booster Turbo Pump (FBTP) leading to mission abort command & subsequent failure of the mission,"" Isro said in a statement.The leakage in the Vent and Relief Valve is being attributed to the damage in the soft seal that could have occurred during the valve operations or due to contamination and valve mounting stresses induced under cryogenic temperature conditions.""The committee has submitted comprehensive recommendations to enhance the robustness of the Cryogenic Upper Stage for future GSLV missions, which includes an active LH2 tank pressurization system to be incorporated to ensure sufficient pressure in the LH2 tank at the appropriate time before engine start command, strengthening of Vent & Relief Valve and associated fluid circuits to avoid the possibility of leakage along with the automatic monitoring of additional cryogenic stage parameters for giving lift-off clearance,"" Isro said.The 51.70-meter-tall rocket GSLV-F10/EOS-03 had successfully lifted off from the second launch pad at the Sriharikota spaceport as planned at 05.43 am on August 12.

402,"March 25, 2022",13:28 IST,science, ,Birds are laying eggs earlier as climate change shifts springs,"The early bird is getting even earlier.With climate change spurring earlier springs across much of North America, many birds are laying their eggs earlier in the year, according to a new study adding to mounting evidence that global warming is turning wildlife habits upside down.Of 72 bird species examined around Chicago, roughly a third lay their eggs about 25 days earlier than they did a century ago, researchers report in the paper published on Friday in the Journal of Animal Ecology.Those affected include the mourning dove, American kestrel and Cooper's hawk.The scientists so far haven't found any clear traits shared by these species, such as size or migratory status, that might explain why they’re changing their schedules.But ""the majority of the birds we looked at eat insects, and insects' seasonal behavior is also affected by climate,"" said lead author John Bates, curator of the bird division at the Field Museum in Chicago.How animal and plant life cycles are affected by climate change and seasonal disruptions is a question that's ""becoming more front and center in people's minds,"" Bates said.Just a few temperature degrees off from the long-term average can have a big impact on when insects emerge, when trees sprout leaves, when flowers bloom and, according to the new research, when eggs hatch.Scientists believe those changes could be among the many reasons for the steep decline in bird populations since the 1970s, with the United States and Canada losing roughly a third of their birds - or about 3 billion birds - according to a 2019 study in the journal Science.Bates and his colleagues studied more than 1,500 egg shell records held at Chicago's Field Museum, many dating back to the period between 1872 to 1920 when gathering eggs was a popular pastime. These Victorian era ova enthusiasts left detailed, handwritten labels listing information such as the bird’s species and collection date.The scientists then compared those records with more than 3,000 modern records, along with data describing carbon dioxide levels on the nesting dates across time, for their analysis.The findings echo similar results from studies carried out in recent decades in the United Kingdom, which also found that egg-laying was happening earlier along with reported changes in the growing season.",Reuters,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/birds-are-laying-eggs-earlier-as-climate-change-shifts-springs-1929425-2022-03-25

404,"March 25, 2022",12:30 IST,science, ,‘Gargantuan task’: Why India’s renewable push will be hard,"Plans to build a sprawling solar park on land cultivated for generations by indigenous farmers in India’s Himalayan foothills erupted in violent clashes with police last year after their crops were bulldozed for the development.Most men from the farming village of a few hundred in Assam state were out looking for work on Dec. 29. One of the few people who remained was Champa Timungpi, who says she was beaten by police and kicked in the stomach when she tried to protest.Pregnant at the time, the 25-year-old was rushed to a hospital for her injuries. “I came back home at night, and I miscarried,” said Tumungpi, who lodged a complaint with police.The lush green village in Nagaon district — still largely unconnected to the grid and home to families who earn less than $2 a day — is now framed by blue solar panels, barbed wire and armed guards.The solar developer Azure Power, listed on the New York Stock Exchange, said in an email that the company legally bought 91 acres (38 hectares) in the village from “recorded landowners” and it’s “incorrect and erroneous” to say the land was forcibly taken.The company’s position is strongly disputed by Timungpi and others in the Mikir Bamuni village who say their rights as tenants and established farmers were ignored. Local officials and police didn’t respond to requests for comment.However it plays out in a district court, the dispute not only speaks to India’s often-tangled land ownership rules rooted in its colonial era. It also illustrates the complexity and immensity of the challenges facing the country of nearly 1.4 billion people in meeting its renewable power goals for the next decade.Over the next 20 years, India’s demand for electricity will grow more than anywhere else in the world. Unlike most countries, India still has to develop and lift millions like Timungpi from poverty, and it will need to build a power system the size of the European Union’s.How India meets its energy and economic needs will have an outsized impact on the world’s climate goals. The country is a major contributor of greenhouse gases from the burning of coal and other fossil fuels.Prime Minister Narendra Modi said at last year’s United Nation climate talks that India would increase its capacity of non-fossil fuels electricity to 500 gigawatts by 2030 — from the 104 gigawatts at the start of this year.To meet its goals, India must add four times the amount of power the average nuclear plant produces — every month until 2030.These short-term energy targets won’t do much to limit global warming to 1.5 Celsius (34.7 Fahrenheit) — the level beyond which scientists warn of catastrophic climate impacts, scientists at last year’s United Nations climate conference had warned.But for India, it’ll still be a “gargantuan task,” requiring investments between $20 billion and $26.8 billion, while only $10 billion is available, a parliamentary committee said last month.Some obstacles to renewables — such as the need to build electricity storage for when the sun isn’t shining or wind isn’t blowing — are global challenges. Others are more specific to India — such as the question of who owns land in poor communities that bear least responsibility for the climate crisis and the need to realign power systems that have relied on coal for centuries.While there’s no clear roadmap yet for India’s renewable energy push, experts cite a federal report last year that said an optimal mix would be getting more than half the country’s power from the sun and wind by 2030.But big solar and wind facilities are sparking conflicts with local communities. This is partly because land ownership is fuzzy at many project sites. For example, some communities have used land for centuries to farm or graze cattle without legal rights over it.As governments and companies focused on transitioning away from fossil fuels, such conflicts were “collaterals” that had to be managed, Kanchi Kohli, an environmental researcher at the Indian think tank Centre for Policy Research.Mandatory environmental impact assessments were waived for solar and wind projects to make them more viable. But environmental issues still have arisen.For instance, India’s Supreme Court in April 2021 ordered that transmission lines for solar energy be put underground after environmentalists reported the lines were killing critically endangered great Indian bustards. Nine months later, the federal government said burying the lines to safeguard the birds would be too costly and would impede green energy development. The court is hearing the matter again.India could reduce its dependence on large solar parks by building solar panels on roofs in cities.The country’s initial rooftop goals were small, but in 2015 it set a target of 40 gigawatts of rooftop solar, enough to power 28 million homes. Customers were allowed to send electricity back to the grid — and the sector grew.In December 2020, the federal government changed rules restricting large industries and businesses from sending electricity back to the grid. These commercial groups are among the highest paying customers for India’s perennially cash-strapped power distribution companies, which lost over $5 billion in 2020.With industries sending electricity back to the grid in the evening when demand and power tariffs are highest, distribution companies were losing their best customers said Vibhuti Garg, an energy economist at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.“They were losing money,” Garg said.The installation cost makes rooftop solar too expensive for most homeowners. That was the case for Siddhant Keshav, 30, a New Delhi entrepreneur, who wanted to put solar panels on his home. “It just didn’t make sense,” he said.Homes comprised less than 17% of India’s rooftop solar in June 2021, according to a report by Bridge to India, a renewable energy consulting firm. And India has only managed to achieve 4% of its 2022 rooftop solar target.Wind could become another important element in India’s clean energy portfolio. But the most “attractive, juicy, windy sites” have small turbines using old technology, said Gagan Sidhu, the director of energy finance at think tank Council on Energy, Environment and Water.By retiring old wind turbines built before 2002, India could unlock a capacity of 1.5 gigawatts, according to a 2017 study by Indo-Germany Energy Forum, the consulting firm Idam Infra and India’s renewable energy ministry. But experts said it’s unclear who would do the retrofitting and pay the bill.With a coastline of over 4,670 miles (about 7,500 kilometers), India could potentially build enough offshore wind farms to provide roughly a third of the country’s 2021 electricity capacity by 2050, according to an assessment led by the Global Wind Energy Council.But these are very expensive to build — and the first such project, a wind farm proposed for the Arabian Sea in 2018, has yet to get underway.",Associated Press,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/-gargantuan-task-why-india-s-renewable-push-will-be-hard-1929392-2022-03-25

The latest image, a composite of 25 different images captured on March 7, shows the sun in unprecedented detail.The image was captured by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) onboard the European spacecraft showing the Sun’s full disc and outer atmosphere, the corona, in high resolution. Another image taken by the Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment (SPICE) instrument is the first of its kind image in 50 years.The images were taken when the Solar Orbiter was at a distance of roughly 75 million kilometers, halfway between our world and its parent star. The European Space Agency in a statement said that taken one after the other, the full image was captured over a period of more than four hours because each tile takes about 10 minutes, including the time for the spacecraft to point from one segment to the next.The high-resolution telescope of EUI takes pictures of such high spatial resolution that, at that close distance, a mosaic of 25 individual images is needed to cover the entire Sun. The agency said that in total the final image contains more than 83 million pixels in a 9148 x 9112 pixel grid, making it ten times better than what a 4K TV screen can display.The image which shows the Sun’s upper atmosphere, the corona, has a temperature of around a million degrees Celsius. Apart from snapping the Sun, the instruments on board were also gathering data, tracing the layers in the Sun’s atmosphere from the corona, down to a layer known as the chromosphere, getting closer to the surface.""And this is just the start, over the coming years the spacecraft will repeatedly fly this close to the Sun.

406,"March 25, 2022",11:20 IST,science, ,Experts worry about how US will see next Covid-19 surge coming,"As coronavirus infections rise in some parts of the world, experts are watching for a potential new COVID-19 surge in the U.S. — and wondering how long it will take to detect.Despite disease monitoring improvements over the last two years, they say, some recent developments don’t bode well:—As more people take rapid COVID-19 tests at home, fewer people are getting the gold-standard tests that the government relies on for case counts.—The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will soon use fewer labs to look for new variants.—Health officials are increasingly focusing on hospital admissions, which rise only after a surge has arrived.—A wastewater surveillance program remains a patchwork that cannot yet be counted on for the data needed to understand coming surges.—White House officials say the government is running out of funds for vaccines, treatments and testing.“We’re not in a great situation,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, a Brown University pandemic researcher.Scientists acknowledge that the wide availability of vaccines and treatments puts the nation in a better place than when the pandemic began, and that monitoring has come a long way.For example, scientists this week touted a 6-month-old program that tests international travelers flying into four U.S. airports. Genetic testing of a sample on Dec. 14 turned up a coronavirus variant — the descendant of omicron known as BA.2 — seven days earlier than any other reported detection in the U.S.But it’s different elsewhere. The World Health Organization this week reported that the number of new coronavirus cases increased two weeks in a row globally, likely because COVID-19 prevention measures have been halted in numerous countries and because BA.2 spreads more easily.Some public health experts aren’t certain what that means for the U.S.BA.2 accounts for a growing share of U.S. cases, the CDC said — more than one-third nationally and more than half in the Northeast. Small increases in overall case rates have been noted in New York, and in hospital admissions in New England.Some of the northern U.S. states with the highest rates of BA.2, however, have some of the lowest case rates, noted Katriona Shea of Penn State University.Dr. James Musser, an infectious disease specialist at Houston Methodist, called the national case data on BA.2 “murky.” He added: “What we really need is as much real-time data as possible ... to inform decisions.”Here’s what COVID-19 trackers are looking at and what worries scientists about them.Tallies of test results have been at the core of understanding coronavirus spread from the start, but they have always been flawed.Initially, only sick people got tested, meaning case counts missed people who had no symptoms or were unable to get swabbed.Home test kits became widely available last year, and demand took off when the omicron wave hit. But many people who take home tests don’t report results to anyone. Nor do health agencies attempt to gather them.Mara Aspinall is managing director of an Arizona-based consulting company that tracks COVID-19 testing trends. She estimates that in January and February, about 8 million to 9 million rapid home tests were being done each day on average — four to six times the number of PCR tests.Nuzzo said: “The case numbers are not as much a reflection of reality as they once were.”In early 2021, the U.S. was far behind other countries in using genetic tests to look for worrisome virus mutations.A year ago, the agency signed deals with 10 large labs to do that genomic sequencing. The CDC will be reducing that program to three labs over the next two months.The weekly volume of sequences performed through the contracts was much higher during the omicron wave in December and January, when more people were getting tested, and already has fallen to about 35,000. By late spring, it will be down to 10,000, although CDC officials say the contracts allow the volume to increase to more than 20,000 if necessary.The agency also says turnaround time and quality standards have been improved in the new contracts, and that it does not expect the change will hurt its ability to find new variants.Outside experts expressed concern.“It’s really quite a substantial reduction in our baseline surveillance and intelligence system for tracking what’s out there,” said Bronwyn MacInnis, director of pathogen genomic surveillance at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.An evolving monitoring system is looking for signs of coronavirus in sewage, which could potentially capture brewing infections.Researchers have linked wastewater samples to the number of positive COVID-19 tests a week later, suggesting health officials could get an early glimpse at infection trends.Some health departments also have used sewage to look for variants. New York City, for example, detected signals of the omicron variant in a sample taken on Nov. 21 — about 10 days before the first case was reported in the U.S.But experts note the system doesn’t cover the entire country. It also doesn’t distinguish who is infected.“It’s a really important and promising strategy, no doubt. But the ultimate value is still probably yet to be understood,” said Dr. Jeff Duchin, the health officer for Seattle/King County, Washington.HOSPITAL DATALast month, the CDC outlined a new set of measures for deciding whether to lift mask-wearing rules, focusing less on positive test results and more on hospitals.Hospital admissions are a lagging indicator, given that a week or more can pass between infection and hospitalization. But a number of researchers believe the change is appropriate. They say hospital data is more reliable and more easily interpreted than case counts.The lag also is not as long as one might think. Some studies have suggested many people wait to get tested. And when they finally do, the results aren’t always immediate.Spencer Fox, a University of Texas data scientist who is part of a group that uses hospital and cellphone data to forecast COVID-19 for Austin, said “hospital admissions were the better signal” for a surge than test results.There are concerns, however, about future hospital data.If the federal government lifts its public health emergency declaration, officials will lose the ability to compel hospitals to report COVID-19 data, a group of former CDC directors recently wrote. They urged Congress to pass a law that will provide enduring authorities “so we will not risk flying blind as health threats emerge.”",Associated Press,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/experts-worry-about-how-us-will-see-next-covid-19-surge-coming-1929347-2022-03-25

The Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization and Ices Explorer (SPHEREx) mission will scan the entire sky every six months and create a map of the cosmos unlike any before.The mission, which is similar in approach to the recently launched James Webb Telescope, will be blasted off into space in April 2025 to probe the cosmic history of our origin. The spacecraft will look into what happened within the first second after the big bang, how galaxies form and evolve, and the prevalence of molecules critical to the formation of life, like water, locked away like ice in our galaxy.“We’re at the transition from doing things with computer models to doing things with real hardware. The design for the spacecraft, as it stands, is confirmed. We have shown that it’s doable down to the smallest details. So now we can really start building and putting things together,” Allen Farrington, SPHEREx project manager said.Countries the world over are vying to become space-faring nations and both ground-based and space-based telescopes are critical in charting the next course of action. While telescopes like Hubble are built to focus on individual stars, galaxies, or other cosmic objects, and to study them in detail, SPHEREx belongs to another class of space telescopes that quickly observe large portions of the sky, surveying many objects in a short period of time.Nasa said that the telescope will scan over 99 per cent of the sky every six months as opposed to Hubble which has barely scanned 0.1 per cent of the sky in more than 30 years of operations. ""Although survey telescopes like SPHEREx can’t see objects with the same level of detail as targeted observatories, they can answer questions about the typical properties of those objects throughout the universe,"" the space agency said.Using SPHEREx, scientists will measure the prevalence of life-sustaining materials like water that reside in icy dust grains in the galactic clouds from which new stars and their planetary systems are born. Astronomers believe the water in Earth’s oceans, thought to be essential to life starting on Earth, originally came from such interstellar material.The SPHEREx mission will work on a similar principle as the James Webb Telescope and collect infrared light  wavelengths outside the range that human eyes can detect. The two telescopes will also both use a technique called spectroscopy to break infrared light into its individual wavelengths, or colors, just like a prism breaks sunlight into its component colors. Spectroscopy is what enables both SPHEREx and Webb to reveal what an object is made of.Despite similar work principles, the two observatories will be vastly different in terms of physical parameters. While Webb is the largest telescope to ever fly in space, with a 21.3-foot (6.5-meter) primary mirror to capture the highest-resolution images of any space telescope in history, SPHEREx has an 8-inch primary mirror and a sun shield that is just 10.5 feet (3.2 meters) across.The new mission will be operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the spacecraft will be developed by Ball Aerospace.

American astronaut Mark Vande Hei will hitch a ride on a Russian spacecraft on March 30 to return to Earth after his record-setting stay onboard the International Space Station (ISS).Vande Hei broke the record for longest single spaceflight by an American astronaut, previously set by astronaut Scott Kelly, who remained in microgravity for 340 days. When Vande Hei returns at the end of this month, he will have lived in space for 355-days in a single mission and completed 5,680 orbits around Earth, covering more than 150 million miles.Nasa said that the American astronaut will strap into the Soyuz MS-19 spacecraft to begin the journey back to Earth along with two Roscosmos cosmonauts, Anton Shkaplerov and Pyotr Dubrov. ""The Soyuz will undock from the Rassvet module, heading for a parachute-assisted landing Wednesday, March 30, on the steppe of Kazakhstan, southeast of the remote town of Dzhezkazgan,"" Nasa said in a statement.As the American astronaut returns from space, he would have accumulated a total of 523 days beyond Earth. Before their return, Russian cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov will hand over the command of the Space Station to astronaut Tom Marshburn during a change of command ceremony.Shkaplerov launched on Soyuz MS-19 on Oct. 5, 2021. This was Dubrov’s first flight. Shkaplerov is ending his fourth mission with 708 cumulative days spent in space. The return process began after the arrival of the new crew from Russia to the International Space Station amid a complete breakdown of relations between Moscow, Europe, and Washington over President Vladimir Putin's attack on Ukraine in a military invasion.Once the Soyuz lands, the MS-19 crew will split up, as per standard crew return practice, with Vande Hei returning to his home in Houston, while the cosmonauts fly back to their training base in Star City, Russia.With the three astronauts returning home, the strength of the Space Station will go down to seven from 10 at the moment. Vande Hei will leave behind Commander Marshburn, NASA astronauts Raja Chari and Kayla Barron, ESA (European Space Agency) astronaut Matthias Maurer, and Roscosmos cosmonauts Oleg Artemyev, Denis Matveev, and Sergey Korsakov.",India Today Web Desk,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/russian-spacecraft-to-bring-back-american-astronaut-from-space-amid-breakdown-in-relations-over-ukraine-1929315-2022-03-25

410,"March 25, 2022",13:12 IST,science, ,What are chemical weapons and why is the US concerned Russia could use them?,"With the war in Ukraine raging for nearly a month, the worry is now shifting to the possible use of chemical weapons by Russia in its invasion. US President Joe Biden has said that Russia's false accusation that Ukraine has biological and chemical weapons hints that Russia’s President Vladimir Putin could use it in the coming days.The first signs came on March 21 when Russia bombed the Sumykhimprom chemical plant in Ukraine's Sumy. It released ammonia in the area forcing people to remain indoors. The chemical contamination could be a major tactic in advancing Russian troops, whose progress in Ukraine has reportedly been slower than anticipated.“They are also suggesting that Ukraine has biological and chemical weapons in Ukraine. That’s a clear sign he’s considering using both of those. He’s already used chemical weapons in the past, and we should be careful of what’s about to come,” US President Joe Biden said.Meanwhile, Russia's defense ministry has accused Kyiv, without providing evidence, of planning a chemical attack against its own people in order to accuse Moscow of using chemical weapons in the invasion of Ukraine that began on February 24.All weapons have chemicals. Gunpowder is also a chemical mixture. But the chemical weapons that are often spoken about are a dreaded mixture of gases or liquids that have toxic properties and can kill humans, animals, and other forms of life.According to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), munitions, devices, and other equipment specifically designed to weaponise toxic chemicals fall under the definition of chemical weapons.The ammonia released by the Sumykhimprom chemical plant is highly corrosive, and exposure to high concentrations can cause blindness, lung damage, and death. While ammonia is not a chemical weapon, its intentional contamination and uncontrolled spread could make it one.The use of chemical weapons was first recorded during World War-I when chlorine, phosgene (a choking agent), and mustard gas (which inflicts painful burns on the skin) were used to inflict serious damage by both sides of the war. That was just the beginning when these dangerous weapons caused nearly 1,00,000 deaths.Over the years, these weapons have been perfected and the Cold War era saw significant development, manufacture, and stockpiling of these weapons of mass destruction. According to the United Nations Office of Disarmament Affairs, chemical weapons have caused more than a million casualties globally.Threat of Russia using chemical weapons in Ukraine looks serious for there is a past. Russia has faced allegations for many years that it has used chemical weapons in targeted killings.The United States had in March last year accused Syrian President Bashar Assad and Russia of trying to block all efforts to hold Damascus accountable for using chemical weapons during attacks on civilians.The US accused Russia of defending Assad “despite its chemical weapons attacks,” obstructing independent investigations, and undermining efforts to hold the Syrian government accountable not only for using chemical weapons but for “numerous other atrocities”.In 2018, Russia was accused of using chemical weapons in an attempted killing of two Russians former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in London.Speaking in Parliament, then UK Prime Minister Theresa May said intelligence experts concluded that the two men charged were officers of Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU.The most recent use of chemicals by Russia to target state opponents came in 2020 when Putin's long-time critic and Opposition leader Alexei Navalny was poisoned.Navalny fell sick on August 20 during a domestic flight in Russia and was flown while he was in a coma to Germany for treatment two days later. Labs in Germany, France, and Sweden, and tests by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, found that he was exposed to a Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent.Chemical and biological weapons have been at the heart of several invasions in the 21st century that began with the US invading Iraq citing similar reasons. Putin now leveling similar accusations on Ukraine, in justification of his war follows the same tactic.The US has hinted that it will ""respond aggressively"" if Russia uses these weapons on Ukraine. Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg last weekend said that any use of chemical weapons would be a blatant and brutal violation of international law, the ban on the use of chemical weapons.""We are very much aware of that we need to act in a way that prevents this conflict from going from being a very bloody, ugly, horrific conflict in Ukraine to something that turns out to be a full-fledged war between NATO and Russia, in Europe, and also potentially involving, of course, the United States directly,” Stoltenberg told NBC.Earlier this month, US national security adviser Jake Sullivan spoke with Nikolay Patrushev, secretary of Russia's Security Council, warning him of consequences for ""any possible Russian decision to use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine.""The war in Ukraine has been going on for 29 days now and Ukrainian forces have not shown any sign of pulling back. The Ukrainian government said it would not obey ultimatums from Russia, which demanded it stop defending besieged Mariupol, where hundreds of thousands of civilians are suffering.",Sibu Tripathi,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/ukraine-war-chemical-weapons-russia-invasion-biden-putin-zelenskyy-1929071-2022-03-24
411,"March 24, 2022",14:38 IST,science, ,"This dinosaur could swim, hunt underwater. Scientists confirm watery lifestyle of extinct species","Spinosaurus, the largest-known carnivorous dinosaur, and its closest relatives long have confounded scientists trying to understand how these unusual water-loving beasts lived their lives and hunted prey. Did they wade into rivers and lakes like a heron? Or did they swim underwater like a hippo or croc?It turns out that the answer was in their bones - their bone density, to be precise. Scientists said on Wednesday that Spinosaurus and its cousin Baryonyx possessed extremely compact bones that would have helped them stay submerged for underwater swimming as semiaquatic predators targeting large prey.Both were members of a Cretaceous Period dinosaur group called spinosaurids that boasted anatomical adaptations such as elongated crocodile-like snouts and conical teeth for hunting aquatic prey. But the researchers found that another spinosaurid called Suchomimus lacked dense bones and likely was a wading predator - showing an unexpected degree of ecological diversity within this group.Spinosaurus, about 50 feet (15 meters) long and weighing seven tons, lived 95 million years ago in Africa. Its anatomy was unlike any other dinosaur, with a relatively small pelvis, short hind legs, paddle-like tail and feet for propulsion in the water and a curious sail-like structure of bony spines 7 feet (2 meters) tall on its back.""I think this animal is simply weird: we have nothing alive today that could be considered remotely similar,"" said Matteo Fabbri, a postdoctoral researcher in paleontology at the Field Museum in Chicago and lead author of the study published in the journal Nature.""I really like the idea of this giant animal, weighing many tons, submerging under water to catch prey. It is striking to me that it has a giant sail-crest on its back. That would have made it hard for it to hide under water, but much more ominous: a bit like a shark fin poking above the water line,"" said University of Oxford paleontologist and study co-author Roger Benson.Baryonyx, 33 feet (10 meters) long, lived 125 million years ago in Europe. Suchomimus, 36 feet (11 meters) long, lived 120 million years ago in Africa.In determining that greater bone density is directly associated with an aquatic existence, the researchers amassed data on 297 species of living and extinct animals, land-dwellers and water-dwellers.Bone compactness was found to be a defining characteristic in animals adapted for life in the water such as whales, seals, dugongs, hippopotamuses, crocodiles, penguins and various extinct marine reptiles. No other dinosaurs were found with the bone density of Spinosaurus and Baryonyx, indicating they were alone among dinosaurs in conquering the aquatic realm.""Spinosaurus has the highest bone density among the three,"" Fabbri said. ""Baryonyx has a slightly lower bone density, but still very similar to Spinosaurus. Suchomimus, found as a more terrestrial animal in our study, has a bone density similar to other terrestrial dinosaurs, reptiles and mammals.""Spinosaurus exceeds even Tyrannosaurus rex in size, but its anatomy has long puzzled scientists. Its original fossils from Egypt were destroyed during World War Two. But the discovery of a skeleton in Morocco in 2008 and additional tail bones dug up subsequently led some paleontologists to propose that Spinosaurus was semiaquatic and an active swimmer. Other researchers looking at the same fossils disagreed.The new study was launched to try to settle the debate.Big fish in rivers and lakes as well as dinosaurs walking along their banks may have been appealing prey for Spinosaurus.""Spinosaurus was perhaps moving along shallow waters using a combination of 'bottom-walking' - like modern hippos - and lateral strokes of its giant tail,"" said University of Cambridge postdoctoral researcher and study co-author Guillermo Navalón. ""Probably used this means of locomotion not to pursue prey for long distances in open waters but to ambush and catch very large fish like lungfishes or coelacanths.""",Reuters,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/this-dinosaur-could-swim-hunt-underwater-scientists-confirm-watery-lifestyle-of-extinct-species-1929031-2022-03-24

Study confirms music improves mental wellbeing, quality of life","Music maestro A R Rahman once said that the idea of music is to liberate the listener and lead him to a frame where he feels he is elevated. And his music does just that.Researchers have now confirmed what Rahman hinted at years ago. Singing, listening, or playing music leads to better well-being and improved health-related quality of life.An analysis of 26 studies comprising 779 individuals found that music interventions were associated with statistically and clinically significant changes in mental health. However, scientists are yet to understand the magnitude of music’s positive association with health-related quality of life.In a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Network Open, researchers said that listening to and making music is increasingly advocated, including in a recent World Health Organization report, as a means of improving health-related quality of life, as well as various domains of well-being in clinical and healthy populations.The analysis revealed that music had a similar positive reinforcement among people as they experienced from weight loss in studies of adults with obesity. Led by J. Matt McCrary, Ph.D. candidate at the Institute of Music Physiology and Musicians’ Medicine, Hannover University of Music, Drama, and Media in Germany, researchers synthesized results of studies investigating outcomes of music interventions in terms of health-related quality of life.The new analysis could add to devising new techniques to enhance wellbeing under the United Nations Sustainable Development goals.The authors of the meta-research, however, also expressed that there need to be more studies in the field to better understand this positive reinforcement on the brain. ""Future research is needed to clarify optimal music interventions and doses for use in specific clinical and public health scenarios,"" the paper said.They pointed out that lack of clarity regarding the effects of music leads to challenges in including it in health policies and care at local, national, and international levels.They added that there is a need to understand the who, what, when, where, and how effective this method is.

413,"March 24, 2022",13:39 IST,science, ," Punish Russia, but protect Russian scientists: CERN ponders response to Ukraine war","The Geneva-area research center that houses the world’s largest atom smasher is grappling with ways to punish Russia’s government while protecting Russian researchers who work to help solve the deepest mysteries of the universe.CERN, the historic acronym for what is now the European Organization for Nuclear Research, has a mission to facilitate collaboration among its 23 member countries and beyond. The war in Ukraine, an associate member state, has the organization trying to calibrate its response to join international action against Russia, which was an official CERN observer before the invasion, without sacrificing science.Some 1,000 scientists, or nearly 7% of the 18,000 researchers involved with CERN, are affiliated with Russian institutions — most, though not all, are Russian. If they are cut off from participating in experiments and other research, it could slow or complicate upcoming projects involving the center’s Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator.A crucial decision for CERN’s governing council looms this week because the collider is set to start operating again in April after a hiatus of more than three years that partly resulted from the coronavirus pandemic. The collider requires regular pauses, and its next run is expected to generate huge amounts of new data.“What kind of projects are the Russians involved here at CERN? It’s essentially in everything that we are doing,” Joachim Mnich, the director for research and computing. “We’re in discussions with the council to find a solution for that: Punish — as much as possible, as we can do — the Russian government. But not punishing our colleagues.”The next operation of the accelerator, which is set to churn out new data starting this summer, will be only the third round of experiments in the collider: A first run took place from 2010 to 2012, and a second from 2015 to 2018. The one starting in April is expected to last until 2026.On March 8, the CERN Council, its governing body, joined international condemnation of the invasion of Ukraine and suspended new collaborations with Russia and its institutions indefinitely. It also expressed support for Russian scientists who “reject this invasion” and stripped Russia of its observer status.CERN is run by 22 European countries and Israel as member states. The United States, Japan and the European Union have observer status. Ukraine is among seven countries with associate member status.Russian researchers are involved in a project for the “high-luminosity” phase of the collider, which should crank up its performance by 2027 and generate vast new amounts of data, CERN says.The Russians are working on physics analysis, computing, and the operation, construction and design of new detectors that catch protons after they are smashed together, Mnich said.Fully two-thirds of the staffers are Russian on an experiment known as NA64, which involves blasting a high-powered electron beam onto a fixed target and searching for unknown particles from a hypothetical dark-sector, he said.Another experiment related to CERN’s accelerator, which propels particles through an underground, 27-kilometer (17-mile) ring of superconducting magnets in and around Geneva, uses synthetic crystals to split and deflect beams. Nearly half of the staff working on the research are from Russia, Mnich said.Yet another project, to study the internal structure of protons and neutrons, has components “delivered by Russian colleagues,” he said.“They are here. They arrived already last year. They’re installed. But we might have problems to operate the detectors if our Russian colleagues will not be able to come to CERN as planned in the future,” Mnich said.“We are not sending anyone home,” he added. “We try to continue to keep them here, but it’s a very difficult situation for us.”",Associated Press,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/ukraine-war-russia-invasion-cern-large-hadron-collider-nuclear-research-putin-1929005-2022-03-24
414,"March 24, 2022",13:19 IST,science, ,"Milky Way had exciting teenage years, new study reveals our home galaxy is older than expected","The Milky Way galaxy, which houses Earth and our solar system, is older than we previously thought. Astronomers using the European Space Agency Gaia mission have found that a part of the galaxy began forming 13 billion years ago, around 2 billion years earlier than expected, as they identify different phases in the life of Akash Ganga.The region known as the thick disc of the Milky Way began forming just 0.8 billion years after the Big Bang. Astronomers from the Max-Planck Institute for Astronomy in Germany combined data from the Gaia mission with measurements of the stars’ chemical compositions compiled by China’s Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) to create a timeline of the Milky Way's evolution.Astronomers Maosheng Xiang and Hans-Walter Rix from Max Planck used data centered around 2,50,000 stars. In these stars, energy has stopped being generated and has moved into a shell around the core as they have transformed into a red giant star.The Milky Way galaxy was formed from the merger of small, gas-rich progenitor galaxies. As these galaxies did not collide head-on, they imparted a spin on the resulting structure, presumably flattening it out into what we now see as the so-called thick disk of our Milky Way: gas and stars in a flat pancake, 100,000 light-years in diameter and 6000 light-years thick.The halo surrounding the Milky Way was created by additional mergers with galaxies that were somewhat smaller than the Milky Way. The “adult years” that followed were much quieter and involved steady star formation activity in the so-called thin disk, which is younger and only about 2000 light-years thick.Astronomers using age and chemical composition data studied the teenage history of the Milky Way galaxy. This has now provided insights into the timeline of the evolution of our home galaxy. The teenage years were the most productive and that lasted from about 13 to about 8 billion years ago.During the early times, all the action was in what we now call the stellar halo and the thick disk, which formed from an initial inflow of gas. An exceptionally large number of new stars formed in our galaxy in a short period of time. This peak was due to a consequence of one merger in particular: the so-called Gaia Enceladus/Sausage, a satellite galaxy whose merger-disrupted remnants were discovered in 2018.About eight billion years ago, the new data shows, the productive teenage years came to an end. While there was still a steady inflow of moderate amounts of fresh hydrogen gas from intergalactic space, star formation activity in the thick disk had ended. But since there was not that much gas coming in, this disk needed to contract much further, to a thickness of only about 2000 light-years, to achieve the right conditions for (moderate) star formation.This led to the formation of the galaxy's extended thin disk, and the Milky Way's adulthood had begun.Astronomers are now looking to gather more data to study the adulthood of the galaxy as they expect the fourth Data Release (DR4) of ESA's Gaia mission in 2024.Understanding the formation, history and evolution of our home galaxy is a major goal for astronomy. The new study by Xiang and Rix constitutes a big step forward by putting much more precise dates onto the different phases of early Milky Way history.",India Today Web Desk,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/milky-way-had-exciting-teenage-years-new-study-reveals-our-home-galaxy-is-older-than-expected-1928990-2022-03-24

The Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science (ARES) Division at Nasa opened the sample that had been kept preserved since the late 1970s and is set to offer insights into the permanent geological record of Earth's only natural satellite.Scientists said that Nasa astronauts and engineers at the time had the forethinking of saving this last lunar sample for a future period in time when the technology improves to examine them in a better way than when they were first brought to Earth. The last lunar sample is being studied by the Apollo Next Generation Sample Analysis Program.“We have had an opportunity to open up this incredibly precious sample that’s been saved for 50 years under vacuum, and we finally get to see what treasures are held within,” Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of Nasa’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington said in a statement.The last remaining sample recovered from the Moon, fifty years ago, has been classified as sample 73001, which was scooped from the lunar surface by astronauts Eugene Cernan and Harrison “Jack” Schmitt. The two astronauts had scrapped this sample by hammering thin cylindrical drive tubes into a landslide deposit in the Moon’s Taurus-Littrow Valley.Sample 73001 is the second half of a bigger sample, whose top half was opened in 2019 and scientists have been studying it. Before recovering the lower half of the sample, scientists conducted extensive scans using X-ray CT technology to capture high-resolution 3D images of the sample’s makeup inside the tube.“The drive tube was very full, which is one of the things we learned with the CT scans, and it caused a slight complication in how we were initially planning to extrude it, but we have been able to adapt using these scans,” Ryan Zeigler, Apollo sample curator said. The work to open the last lunar sample began earlier this year with the team working to capture any gas present within the outer protective tube and, finally, by piercing the inner container, to extract any lunar gases remaining inside.“We are the first people who got to actually see this soil for the first time. It’s just the best thing in the world like a kid in the candy store, right?” deputy Apollo sample curator Juliane Gross said.Scientists hope that the sample will open a window into the ancient history of the Moon, and since Artemis astronauts will go beyond the more familiar lunar equator to the South Pole, with its sometimes cryogenic, or frozen conditions, and its dramatic lighting, the lunar soil there offers tantalizing prospects for study.“The Moon’s South Pole is a great place for potentially building up large deposits of what we call volatiles, [substances that evaporate at normal temperatures, like water ice and carbon dioxide. These volatiles can give us clues about where the water came from in this part of the solar system whether from comets, asteroids, solar wind, or otherwise,” Lori Glaze, director of the Planetary Science Division said.With humans set to return to the Moon, analysis of the last remaining lunar sample from the Apollo era is set to provide new information about volatile reservoirs and the geologic evolution of the Moon.",India Today Web Desk,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/scientists-open-last-lunar-sample-that-was-vacuum-sealed-on-the-moon-50-years-ago-1928920-2022-03-24

The space agency has now asked SpaceX to transform the company’s proposed human landing system into a spacecraft for recurring services for a second demonstration mission.The second contract dubbed Sustaining Lunar Development contract expedites progress toward a long-term, sustaining lander capability as early as the 2026 or 2027 timeframe. “We expect to have two companies safely carry astronauts in their landers to the surface of the Moon under Nasa’s guidance before we ask for services, which could result in multiple experienced providers in the market,"" Lisa Watson-Morgan, program manager for the Human Landing System Program said in a statement.Nasa will release the details of requirements for future development and demonstration lunar landing capability to take astronauts between orbit and the surface of the Moon in the coming weeks. The agency said that the effort is meant to maximize NASA’s support for competition and provides redundancy in services to help ensure NASA’s ability to transport astronauts to the lunar surface.The agency is in no mood to remain limited to the Moon and aims to push forward to Mars in the coming decades. “Under Artemis, NASA will carry out a series of groundbreaking missions on and around the Moon to prepare for the next giant leap for humanity: a crewed mission to Mars,"" Nelson added.",India Today Web Desk,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/nasa-moon-mission-artemis-astronauts-spacex-starship-lunar-lander-mars-1928893-2022-03-24

It is dying","The brightest comet that passed by Earth, in 2021, lighting up the sky for days has disintegrated and is missing key parts as it moves away from the Sun. The object hit the Sun in January this year after crossing Earth. The comet is now missing its core nucleus and its coma that makes up the temporary atmosphere.With its nucleus missing, the comet has been fading in brightness and could end up being just another whiff of dust and gas as it keeps moving in its orbit. Discovered by Gregory Leonard, the remnants of the comet can be seen in the morning sky in the Southern Hemisphere.""The comet's legacy was the tail structure made up of charged particles, known as ions. The tail was subject to ""spectacular outburst-induced displays"" after spotting the comet on Jan. 3, 2021,"" Gregory Leonard told EarthSky. He added that the comet will be known for the appearance of the tails, some of the best ever observed.Leonard told EarthSky that it was an utterly surreal experience having a much-anticipated comet sailing dimly overhead for most of 2021, and I was thrilled when it began brightening and tracking across the autumn and winter skies, and of course, bearing my family’s name as it was.Comet Leonard entered Earth's skies nearly a year after it was first discovered around Jupiter in January 2021. Gregory, a senior research specialist, spotted the faint object, which was nearly 1,60,000 times dimmer than the faintest stars visible to the unaided eye. At the time, the comet was 149.565 million kilometers from the Sun near the orbit of Jupiter.The comet turned out to be the brightest object to pass in the skies in 2021 and a rare object that must have visited this region about 70,000 years ago. Since the object has been far away from solar rays for so long it could have frozen carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and carbon monoxide, which vapourised giving it a high brightness. But as they came closer to the Sun its brightness began diminishing.The comet was already on a path taking it outside of the solar system and not returning for another glimpse anytime soon. Talking about the demise of the comet, Leonard said, ""I don’t mind the fact that it may have disintegrated. With its post-perihelion hyperbolic orbit, I once imagined the comet sometime in the deep future haunting another solar system. Now with its nucleus possibly disintegrated, it may more strangely appear as a ghostly, hyperbolic wisp of dust and gas if that.""Ground-based telescopes and spacecraft have been tracking this unique visitor from deep space. Europe's Solar Orbiter caught a glimpse of the fiery tail of the comet as it monitored its evolution going closer to the Sun. The Heliospheric Imager onboard the spacecraft captured the comet streaking diagonally across the field of view with the Milky Way as a backdrop.

Analysts estimate that hydrogen prices would need to halve in order to compete with gasoline and diesel.The NDRC called for a rational layout of hydrogen projects based on resources and market demand to avoid disorderly competition.""Local government will be strictly forbidden to blindly follow the trend of hydrogen project construction and will be prevented from building low-end projects in order to avoid the waste of resources,"" said Wang.Almost all provinces and regions in China have included hydrogen into their development plans.Some major Chinese companies in the energy, auto and metallurgy sectors, such as Sinopec, Baosteel and GCL, have also expanded their businesses to include hydrogen production, using natural gas and renewable energy, building hydrogen filling stations and using hydrogen in steelmaking and transportation.",Reuters,https://www.indiatoday.in/environment/story/china-sets-green-hydrogen-target-for-2025-eyes-widespread-use-1928549-2022-03-23

The rocket will be used to launch the next lab module to its under-construction Space Station, which is currently inhabited by three Chinese taikonauts.Scientists at the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation fired the engine for a duration of 100 seconds on Monday, confirming that it is ready to enter the final assembly of the rocket. According to Xinhua, the engine is the most advanced cryogenic liquid rocket engine ever designed and manufactured in China.Following the successful engine fire, the rocket still has to complete at least 20 experimental tasks for engineers to test its performance and green light the launch of the new mission. The Long March-5 rocket will carry the Mengtian module to Tiangong, which is expected to be finished by the end of this year.The Chinese space station has so far seen two crewed missions docking with astronauts living in microgravity and readying the outpost for future research and deep space explorations. A total of six astronauts, all of Chinese descent, have so far lived on the space station.The Chinese National Space Administration has said that once the construction is completed, the flying laboratory will be able to house six astronauts at any present time. Beijing recently hinted that it will also open up its Space Station to private players as it looks for commercial use of the outpost.Meanwhile, the country is also looking to open foreign astronauts on Tiangong in the future.

The experts are likely to look at technologies that can help in the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere that is responsible for the warming of the planet.The third installment of the Sixth Assessment Report will not just have the experts in attendance but also leaders from all across the world, who will have to sign and approve the document for it to become binding when the panel releases it on April 4.The panel has so far released two sets of reports detailing the causes, challenges, and impacts of the rising temperatures. While the first showed that unless there are immediate, rapid, and large-scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, limiting warming to close to 1.5 degrees Celsius to 2 degrees Celsius will be beyond reach, the second report found that human-induced climate change is causing dangerous and widespread disruption in nature. It’s affecting the lives of billions around the world and the window for action is narrowing.Professor Navroz K. Dubash from the Centre for Policy Research, who is a Coordinating Lead Author (CLA) for the third report, said that the IPCC Working Group 3 report faces the daunting task of assessing the research and guiding policymakers on solutions to the urgent challenge of climate change.""India certainly faces the risk of serious climate harms that will impact our development prospects and has a strong interest in the collective implementation of solutions by the world community,"" Professor Navroz said adding that the IPCC will inform this action by assessing scenarios, policies, laws, and governance and prospects in specific sectors.The third report will lay out a way forward for how governments can mobilise to accelerate mitigation action to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.The UN body has released two reports in the last eight months that have found that climate change is emerging as one of the biggest threats concerning not just the world, but the entire planet. In its first report, released in August last year, the panel expressed concerns over the climate reaching a tipping point.Quantifying the likelihood of extreme events in a wide variety of scenarios, the UN panel said that for 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming, there will be increased heat waves, longer warm seasons, and shorter cold seasons. At two degrees Celsius of global warming, heat extremes would more often reach critical tolerance thresholds for agriculture and health.The second part of the report released last month revealed that if human-caused global warming isn’t limited to just another couple tenths of a degree, an Earth now struck regularly by deadly heat, fires, floods, and drought in future decades will degrade in 127 ways with some being “potentially irreversible.”The reports shed light on how climate change interacts with global trends such as unsustainable use of natural resources, growing urbanization, social inequalities, losses and damages from extreme events, and a pandemic, jeopardizing future development.",India Today Web Desk,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/un-ipcc-report-climate-change-mitigation-carbon-global-warming-april-4-1928529-2022-03-23

Asteroid 2013 BO76 will swing past Earth at a distance of 51,11,759 kilometers, which is extremely close for Nasa to term it a potentially hazardous asteroid.The asteroid has a diameter of around 450 meters, making it big enough to cause a lot of destruction if it hit Earth. However, the planet remains safe from it since it will just look on as the asteroid goes into its orbit. At its close, the asteroid will be flying at a staggering speed of 49513.45 kilometers per hour.The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which tracks Near-Earth Objects, has released the orbital parameters of the asteroid along with its orbital diagram around Earth that extends beyond the orbit of Mars in an elongated shape. The asteroid, if compared to objects on the planet, has a similar size as the Empire State Building in the United States.The asteroid last visited us in 2013, when it flew as close as 78,88,295 kilometers from Earth. The JPL has said that after Thursday's close flyby, the asteroid will next visit Earth on July 14, 2033. During its 2033 approach, asteroid 2013 BO76 will be at a distance of 1,91,85,926 kilometers.The latest asteroid flyby comes days after astronomers detected an asteroid with a low chance of hitting Earth, crashing to the surface hours later. The object, which was barely two meters in size, entered the atmosphere southwest of Jan Mayen, a Norwegian island 470 kilometers off the east coast of Greenland and northeast of Iceland. The impact was confirmed by infrasound detectors.Asteroids are rocky fragments left over from the formation of the solar system about 4.6 billion years ago.

Still, authorities were keeping a power-supply warning in place for Wednesday, public broadcaster NHK said, meaning the world's no.3 economy could still face blackouts.A similar warning for the northeastern area was lifted, NHK said.A magnitude 7.4 earthquake last week off the northeastern coast - the same region devastated by an earthquake and tsunami in 2011 - temporarily cut power to about 2 million households, including hundreds of thousands in Tokyo.""At this rate, we are coming closer to a state where we will have to conduct power outages similar to those that took place after the quake,"" the trade minister, Koichi Hagiuda, said earlier on Tuesday.The quake hit six thermal plants, knocking them out of operation in areas served by Tepco and Tohoku Electric Power Co (9506.T), and the damage could leave some of them idle for weeks or even months, Hagiuda said.Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno earlier called on residents in eastern Japan affected by the power crisis to do their part, including by lowering thermostats to around 20C (68F) and switching off unnecessary lights.Numerous users responded to the call.National broadcaster NHK dimmed its studio lights while electronics retailer Bic Camera (3048.T) turned off about half of the televisions at dozens of its stores.The 634-metre (693-yard) Tokyo Skytree tower turned off its lights for the whole day for the first time and operators of the city-centre Tokyo Tower lit up only its bottom half.'RESTART NUCLEAR POWER'Retail giant Seven & I Holdings (3382.T) said 8,500 7-Eleven stores set their thermostats to 20C - one degree cooler than usual - while its Ito-Yokado supermarkets were dimming their lights by 10%.Nissan Motor (7201.T) said it was using an in-house power generator for 13 hours at its factory north of the capital.Many individual consumers also did their bit.""I use the heater a lot so I will try to do my part to save energy,"" said college student Shuntaro Ishinabe, 22.Government spokesperson Matsuno said the request to save energy was unlikely to extend beyond Tuesday, given an expected rise in temperatures and the addition of more solar power generation as the weather improved.Japan has faced a tough energy market since the 2011 earthquake and tsunami crippled Tepco's Fukushima Daiichi plant, causing the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl and leading to the suspension of operations at most of Japan's nuclear reactors.With energy prices surging on tight global supply and the Ukraine crisis, Japan's biggest business lobby, Keidanren, has been calling for a swift restart of the nuclear plants.""A sudden halt of energy causes a lot of problems, and I think (the general public) has really felt the importance of energy security given recent events,"" Keidanren Chairman Masakazu Tokura said.""Given the larger trend to become carbon neutral and cut back on greenhouse gases, I believe there will be more difficulties unless we restart nuclear power plants swiftly.""",Reuters,https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/japan-turns-down-the-heat-and-dims-the-lights-to-avoid-power-cut-after-quake-1928477-2022-03-23

The Ingenuity helicopter that reached Mars over a year ago, has exceeded its expectation that was initially limited to a few technological demonstrations.Since its arrival on Mars, Ingenuity has emerged as a big player in deep space exploration, boosting our capabilities of aerial reconnaissance on a planet that has remained inhospitable for millions of years. With 22 flights under its belt, the Ingenuity team is not in a resting mode and is already planning the 23rd flight later this week.During its 22nd flight on Mars, the helicopter remained in the air for 101.4 seconds, climbing to an altitude of 10 meters above the rugged Martian terrain. The 1.8 kilogram quadcopter was originally scheduled to conduct just five flights on Mars, showing that it was possible to fly in the Martian air.The helicopter has flown for 4,647 meters on Mars as it is currently flying to the northwest portion of a region known as Séítah in the Jazero crater, where it will be staged for the next phase of operations.

The launch of the satellite ended the dependency of the Indian Navy on foreign satellites like Inmarsat for communication services.According to Isro, ""GSAT-7 is an advanced communication satellite built by ISRO to provide a wide range of service spectrum from low bit rate voice to high bit rate data communication. The GSAT-7 Communication payload is designed to provide communication capabilities to users over a wide oceanic region including the Indian land-mass.""Launched in the geosynchronous transfer orbit, the satellite, also dubbed Rukmini, has emerged as a potent communication tool for the armed forces for nearly a decade. The spacecraft was equipped with transponders in Ku band, S-band, C band and UHF (ultra-high frequency) band to improve the maritime communications among the Indian Navy's warships.Rukmini was the first military satellite developed by Isro and launched atop an Ariane 5 ECA rocket from Kourou in French Guiana. The satellite connects the Navy's warships, aircraft, submarines and land-based communication systems in real-time.India followed GSAT-7 with GSAT-7A, dubbed the ""Indian Angry Bird"", launched in 2018. This satellite helped in the formation of a band of communications satellites for the Indian military. The 2,250-kg military communications satellite helped in connecting all assets of the Indian Air Force and serves as a force multiplier.

The Arctic Sea Ice has hit yet another low and struck its annual maximum extent on February 25. Nasa, which has been tracking the ice melting and growth in the frigid world, said that this year’s wintertime extent is the 10th-lowest in the satellite record maintained.The records are maintained by the National Snow and Ice Data Center, one of NASA’s Distributed Active Archive Centers. According to data, the Arctic sea ice extent peaked at14.88 million square kilometers and is roughly 7,70,000 square kilometers below the 1981-2010 average maximum -- equivalent to missing an area of ice over twice the size of Rajasthan.Sea ice in the Arctic grows and melts based on seasonal changes in the region every year, it reaches its maximum extent around March after growing through the colder months and shrinks to its minimum extent in September after melting through the warmer months. Meanwhile, in the Southern Hemisphere, the Antarctic sea ice follows an opposite cycle.Satellite sensors gather sea ice data that are processed into daily images, each image grid cell spanning an area of roughly 25 kilometers by 25 kilometers. Scientists then use these images to estimate the extent of the ocean where sea ice covers at least 15% of the water.Nasa said that since satellites began reliably tracking sea ice in 1979, maximum extents in the Arctic have declined at a pace of about 13% per decade, with minimum extents declining at about 2.7% per decade. ""These trends are linked to warming caused by human activities such as emitting carbon dioxide, which traps heat in the atmosphere and causes temperatures to rise. NASA’s analysis also shows the Arctic is warming about three times faster than other regions,"" Nasa said in a statement.Sea ice in the Arctic is surrounded by land, whereas sea ice in the Antarctic is surrounded only by the ocean and can thus spread out more freely. Overall, the Antarctic sea ice record shows a slightly upward but nearly flat trend or increase.Scientists have been warning of a faster and more abrupt breakdown in the already worsening climate situation on the planet. Experts speculate that Earth’s poles are undergoing simultaneous freakish extreme heat with parts of Antarctica more than 40 degrees Celsius warmer than average and areas of the Arctic more than 30 degrees Celsius warmer than average.Scientists were hoping that the Antarctic would cool down at the moment after its summer as the Arctic slowly emerges from its winter.

Both the Arctic and Antarctic are feeling the heat as the planet warms. Scientists have warned of a faster and more abrupt breakdown in the already worsening climate situation on the planet.The Concordia station on the Antarctic Plateau hit a record temperature when it jumped to -20 degrees Celsius from the seasonal norm of over -50 degrees Celsius on Tuesday. The sudden rise in temperature shows the heat has been playing its part and a similar situation was observed on the Russia-led Vostok station.Experts speculate that Earth’s poles are undergoing simultaneous freakish extreme heat with parts of Antarctica more than 70 degrees (40 degrees Celsius) warmer than average and areas of the Arctic more than 50 degrees (30 degrees Celsius) warmer than average.Dr. Robert Rohde, Lead Scientist at Berkeley Earth, in a tweet said that the remote research station at Dome C recorded a temperature nearly 40 degrees Celsius above normal for this time of year, beating the previous March record by a startling 20 degrees Celsius.Scientists were hoping that the Antarctic would cool down at the moment after its summer as the Arctic slowly emerges from its winter. However, melting on both poles together has surprised experts. “They are opposite seasons. You don’t see the north and the south (poles) both melting at the same time. It’s pretty stunning,” Walt Meier, a scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center said.Scientists have called the rapid rise in temperatures on both the poles together a sign of Earth's climate going through an unprecedented change. The continuous melting could bring in new problems for humans as sea levels will rise faster than expected, submerging current-day coastlines in several parts of the world.Scientists said that strong winds coming from Australia were contributing to the unusual temperatures in Antarctica. ""We have had a combination of strong weather systems over the Southern Ocean to the south of Australia that aligned to produce very strong poleward winds stretching from Australia to eastern Antarctica,” Alex Sen Gupta, an associate professor at the University of New South Wales in Sydney told The Guardian.Dr. Rohde, explaining the situation, said that the warm conditions over Antarctica were spurred by an extreme atmospheric river, or a narrow corridor of water vapor in the sky, on its east coast. ""The excessive moisture from the atmospheric river was able to retain large amounts of heat. This event is rewriting record books and our expectations about what is possible in Antarctica. Is this simply a freakishly improbable event, or is it a sign of more to come?

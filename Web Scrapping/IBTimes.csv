0,2022-03-14,16:50:19,society,fact-check,"Fact check: No, Ugandan cop didn't hit journalist with catapult; here's the truth"," A Ugandan cop is creating a buzz on social media. His photo has gone viral on social media, wherein he can be seen posing with a catapult. More than the photo, it is the context with which it was shared on Twitter that has prompted a response from netizens. The claim A viral social media post claimed that an Uganda police spokesman hit a journalist with a catapult. The back the claim, a photo of the said officer aiming a catapult convinced the masses. ""Newly appointed Uganda police spokesman hits news reporter with a catapult for asking irrelevant question,"" a Twitter user (_@Sir_CharlesR) alleged in a tweet on Saturday. The post went viral shortly after. It got nearly 7,000 RTs and over 25,000 likes. Many shared the post as humour, taking a dig at Indian media, while others questioned its authenticity. Several users on Twitter shared the post with the same claim, making the masses believe. Fact check International Business Times reviewed the viral claims on social media. With a reverse image search of the viral photograph, we were able to find a link to a YouTube video by UBC Television Uganda, which is an Uganda public broadcast service. The person seen in the photo is Fred Enanga, Ugandan police force spokesperson, and from a video, in which the officer is warning the public about notorious gangs targeting civilians with catapults. The video was uploaded on April 13, 2021, and the caption clearly debunks the viral claims made on Twitter. The caption read: ""UGANDAN POLICE TIGHTEN VIGILANCE AGAINST CATAPULT GANGS."" In the video, the officer can be heard saying: ""You do like this and you target somebody. So you can see how dangerous this thing is"" while pulling the catapult. ""They are very dangerous because they are capable of firing metallic and credible projectiles or metallic bearings,"" he had warned. In the description of the video, it read: ""Uganda police is investigation about a criminal gang trading terror activities using catapults to destabilize the country. While addressing the media in the weekly brief, the spokesperson of police Fred Enanga says some suspects are already apprehended as police is tracing for the rest."" Besides this evidence, the official Twitter handle of Uganda Police Force also responded to one of the viral threads saying ""fake news"". The thread was by a popular Kenyan lawyer Ahmednasir Abdullahi, who took potshots at the Uganda Police while sharing the viral photo of Fred Enanga. Abdullahi deleted his tweet after the correction. Based on these facts, IBTimes has arrived at the conclusion that the viral photo claiming to be of a Ugandan cop hitting a journalist with a catapult is false and baseless.","

1,2022-02-21,21:54:03,society,fact-check,"Fact check: Murdered Bajrang Dal activist not ""terrorist""; had no links to Tripura violence"," The brutal murder of Bajrang Dal activist in Shivamogga district of Karnataka on Sunday has spurred tensions in the communally-sensitive region of the southern state. Prohibitory orders were clamped and holiday announced on Monday for schools and colleges in the city. The police department is on high alert throughout the state after an incident of violence were reported. Fearing large-scale violence, the Shivamogga city has been turned into a police fortress. While the hunt for the murderers is underway, leaders from both sides of the party are demanding stringent actions against the culprits. The miscreants, who came in a car, had chased him and attacked him with lethal weapons and then escaped from the spot. Though Harsha was shifted to the Meggan hospital, he succumbed to injuries. Harsha was actively involved in Bajrang Dal and VHP activities. He used to be at the forefront during Ganesh festivities and visarjan ceremony. Tense situation prevailed immediately after the incident. Amidst all the chaos, a foreign journalist sparked a controversy after he called Harsha a ""terrorist"" and claimed that 23-year-old was involved in the communal violence that erupted in Tripura last October. The claim Foreign journalist CJ Werleman claimed in a tweet that Harsha was involved in the communal violence that took place in Tripura last year. He even called the Bajrang Dal worker a terrorist, all while labelling the organisation a ""terrorist organisation."" His tweet, in a matter of hours, gained thousands of likes and RTs. While most of the users on Twitter called out Werleman for his claims, some even sided with him. Many users asked the tweet be deleted and his account suspended. Fact check International Business Times reviewed the claims made in the tweet by Werleman. While the tweet clearly appears propagandist in nature, the lack of evidence to back the claims makes it bogus. Looking back, the foreign journalist has habitually spewed anti-India statements using incidents out of their context. In June last year, he had claimed that a Muslim man's beard for shaved off by ""Hindutva"" mob in UP for refusing to chant ""Jai Sri Ram' while the actual incident from far from it. Ghaziabad Police investigated the incident and found it to be related to a dispute over the amulets the man used to trade in. Similarly, the foreign journalist had called for boycott of ""Make in India"" products last year to save Muslims in India and J&K. He had even claimed that a Muslim graveyard was destroyed in Himachal Pradesh, which also was fake news. As for the current claim, Karnataka DGP Praveen Sood debunked the false allegations. He said, ""This is absolutely false. There is no connection of death to either terrorism or Tripura"" in response to the journo's tweet. Hence, IBTimes has also arrived at the conclusion that the claims made by the foreign journalist are false and the murdered Bajrang Dal activist had no connection to the Tripura violence.","

2,2022-02-16,01:03:07,society,fact-check,Fact check: Nandan Nilekani isn't launching crypto project; it's fake news," Discussion over cryptocurrency took prominence in the latest Budget. Infosys co-founder and its non-executive chairman Nandan Nilekani chimed in on the subject of crypto at the Reuters Next Conference. Not long after, rumours started making the rounds of the internet, saying Nilekani was launching a new crypto project. ""There is a role for crypto as assets but they obviously will have to follow all the laws and make sure that it doesn't become a backdoor for money laundering ... they have to use that [as] an entry point to get lot of young people into financial markets,"" Nilekani was quoted as saying. But it appears, his views on crypto started spinning the rumour mill. The claim Rumours about Nilekani launching his own crypto project spread like wildfire. Social media, WhatsApp and Telegram groups were buzzing with unverified reports that Nilekani will lead a crypto project in India. Some of these messages are accompanied by links. The reports of Nilekani's crypto project gave hope to advocates of the digital tokens in India, especially at a time when the Indian government is leaning in the opposite direction. The government has imposed hefty capital gains on crypto and is looking to classify crypto as an asset class. Fact check International Business Times reviewed the claims about Nilekani's crypto project. Even before the unverified reports got out of hand and started making the headlines, Nilekani was quick to issue a clarification on the matter. Not only did Nilekani rubbish the rumours, but he also warned people not to click on them. They may be malicious in nature. ""You may have encountered a post on various social media platforms claiming that I have launched a crypto project. This is fake news! Please avoid clicking on it and report it as misleading/false information on the platform where you see it,"" Nilekani tweeted. With this, Nilekani clarified that all the rumours about him launching a crypto project are false. Hence, IBTimes has arrived at the conclusion that Nilekani isn't launching a crypto project.","

3,2022-02-09,02:12:06,society,fact-check,Fact check: Indian flag not replaced by saffron flag in Karnataka amid hijab row [truth here]," Shocking details are emerging from the widespread incidents of violence from across Karnataka on Tuesday in the backdrop of hijab row. The miscreants have attacked a teacher with iron rods causing severe head injuries to him in Bagalkot district. But making another headline was the incident of replacing the national flag with a saffron one at a government college in Shivamogga. Many social media users, journalists, news publications claimed that the national flag was replaced with a saffron flag at a government college in Karnataka's Shivamogga, triggering an outrage. As the video of the incident went viral on social media with Congress leader DK Shivakumar tweeting about it, many users condemned the actions of the boys. But it was later clarified that there was no national flag on the pole when the boys hoisted the saffron flag. The claim As the hijab row got intense across Karnataka, the incident of a group of boys replacing the tricolour with saffron flag added fuel to the fire. Many condemned the actions of the unidentified boys. Many social media users, mainly DK Shivakumar and many other verified accounts of journalists and news outlets, tweeted about the incident. DK Shivakumar tweeted that ""The situation in some Karnataka educational institutions has gone so out of hand that in one case the National flag was replaced by a saffron flag."" #KarnatakaHijabRow @INCKarnataka president @DKShivakumar has tweeted saying replacing National flag with Saffron flag at #Shimoga is a breakdown of law and order.And the college should be closed for a week. pic.twitter.com/0Rr3RL4cyn Fact check The incident drew severe backlash mainly for the seriousness of the actions. Disrespecting the national flag is intolerable and a criminal offence, but as it appears, the claims made online were half-baked truths. While the boys did hoist a saffron flag on the pole of the Government First Grade College (CFGC) campus, they did not take down the national flag in doing so. In fact, BOOM reached out to Dhananjaya BR, the principal of the college, who confirmed that there was no tricolour on the pole when the students with saffron shawls hoisted the saffron flag. Further, none of the videos of the incident backs the claims of DK Shivkumar or any other users who condemned the actions of the boys. ""The flag pole was empty when the protesting students were there, if a tricolour was removed, there would have been more protests. I saw a student climb up and put the saffron flag there,"" the principal who was at the spot told BOOM.""There was no national flag on the pole then, and the last time it was hoisted was on January 26, 2022, and was removed after 6 pm that day. Since then the flag pole in the college has no flag hoisted on it,"" he added. Based on the facts available, IBTimes has arrived at the conclusion that the national flag was not replaced by a saffron flag in Shivamogga.","

4,2022-02-08,18:20:45,society,fact-check,Fact check: Viral video falsely links J&K police to student unrest in KU [truth here]," University of Kashmir students are protesting against offline exams, while demanding the varsity to hold examinations online. A large number of engineering and nursing students of KU staged a protest on Monday, days after the administration announced that all the postponed and pending exams would be held from mid-February through offline mode. Amid the ongoing protests, a video went viral on social media, falsely claiming J&K police was interfering with the student unrest inside the KU campus. The claim Several users on Twitter are circulating a video of what appears to be from inside the KU campus and linking it to J&K police. According to some claims, J&K police was threatening students of the university. The video has been viewed thousands of times. One user, whose video went viral on Twitter, claimed the students were threatened with encounter. ""Fake encounter kra dain gay."" Jammu Kashmir Police threatening the students of university of #KashmirDay. pic.twitter.com/RGCbsORkt7 Fact check International Business Times reviewed the footage in question and the claims made by some users. Looking closely at the 15-second video, there's no evidence of J&K Police being present on the KU campus. In fact, the only piece of evidence the uploader has to link it to J&K police is the olive green jacket. Further, the Srinagar Police took note of the viral video and issued a clarification, debunking the claims. It said, the J&K Police has nothing to do with the internal matters of Kashmir University. ""There is a viral clip circulating in social media falsely linking J&K police with a student unrest inside KU. It is clarified that JKP has nothing to do with internal matters of KU. Police never enters edu institutes for this. Kindly don't malign us for hidden motivated agendas,"" Srinagar Police said in a tweet. The police further clarified its point, by pointing out that people wearing olive jackets are not always from police. ""All those wearing olive jackets aren't always from police. Do a fact check from Kashmir university authorities about identity of these persons before spreading fake news. Srinagar Police is always committed to uphold highly level of professionalism,"" the statement read. All those wearing olive jackets aren’t always from police. Do a fact check from Kashmir university authorities about identity of these persons before spreading fake news. Srinagar Police is always committed to uphold highly level of professionalism. Based on the official statement by the Srinagar Police and lack of evidence to support that J&K Police was threatening KU students, IBTimes has arrived at the conclusion that the viral video falsely linked to J&K Police.","

5,2022-02-08,01:15:22,society,fact-check,"Fact check: SRK seen with manager in viral pic from Lata Mangeshkar's funeral, not Gauri Khan"," After the death of legendary singer Bharat Ratna Lata Mangeshkar on Sunday, many eminent personalities, including Bollywood celebrities, attended the 92-year-old singer's funeral. Among the celebrities, Shah Rukh Khan was also seen attending the funeral. King Khan was seen in the public after a long time, as the actor was avoiding public appearances since Aryan's Khan's drug case controversy. However, his appearance has caused some massive confusion among fans and followers on the internet. Shah Rukh Khan was accompanied to the funeral by his manager, Pooja Dadlani. However, many people have assumed that the 'Raees' actor was with his wife, Gauri Khan. Multiple posts on Twitter showed Shah Rukh Khan praying next to Lata Mangeshkar's dead body after offering floral tribute to the singer with another woman clad in white attire standing and praying next to him. ""Shah Rukh Khan and wife Gauri pay their respects to Lata Mangeshkar. Beautiful,"" wrote a person in a tweet. Another person wrote, ""This is India. Srk and his wife Gauri paying respects at Lata Mangeshkar's funeral."" This is India ??Srk and his wife Gauri paying respects at Lata Mangeshkar’s funeral???? pic.twitter.com/TgIWGfL3S0 International Business Times reviewed those claims and deemed it fit to clear the air once and for all. The fact is that Gauri Khan did not even attend the funeral and the actor was accompanied by his manager Pooja Dadlani at the venue. While Shah Rukh raised his hands in dua, Pooja was seen joining her hands in prayer. Shah Rukh Khan's fans corrected many people online who had the misconception, letting them know that it was Pooja and not Gauri. Upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that it is not Gauri. The hairstyle and complexion of Pooja are totally different from that of Gauri Khan. Even the height is a mismatch, giving a clear indication that SRK was accompanied by his manager and not Gauri to the funeral. Pooja has been working with Shah Rukh for years now and she often shares photos with the Khan family on social media. She was recently spotted at a lunch date with Gauri, Farah Khan, Seema Khan, Neelam Kothari Soni, Maheep Kapoor and others. Sharing photos from their meet, she wrote, ""Brunch with my favourite bunch... the Bollywood wives are just as much fun off screen... great food, great conversation and no gossip whatsoever."" A post shared by Pooja Dadlani Gurnani (@poojadadlani02) Early in October 2021, Pooja was also in news during Aryan Khan's drugs case controversy and she was alleged to have paid a huge amount of Rs 50 lakh to an independent witness of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) after Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan was detained from a Goa-bound ship off Mumbai's coast. Thus, after reviewing the evidence, International Business Times has concluded that it was Pooja Dadlani who was clicked with the actor and not his wife, Gauri Khan.","

6,2022-01-07,22:29:49,society,fact-check,Fact check: Viral video calling for removal of Sikhs from Indian Army is morphed [truth here]," As Punjab elections approach, some anti-India elements sponsored by Pakistan are hard at work, spreading misinformation with the intention to destabilise the country. A video claiming to be from a Cabinet Committee on Security meeting is widely in circulation, which is creating waves across the country, especially in the border state of Punjab. Several propaganda handles are sharing the video, provoking a strong response from unsuspecting individuals who haven't been able to identify the fake content. The claim A video, claiming to be of a security meeting, is being circulated with the caption: ""Cabinet Committee on Security Meeting Minister Anurag Thakur, S Jaishankar calls for removal of Sikhs from the Indian army."" In the video, someone can be heard calling for the removal of all Punjabis from the Indian Army. ""All generals, all soldiers, remove all of them from top to bottom,"" a background voice is heard saying, while showing visuals from a Union Cabinet meeting. In the video, PM Narendra Modi, HM Amit Shah, MEA S Jaishankar, FM Nirmala Sitharaman and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval appear to be in attendance. #alert Cabinet Committee on Security Meeting Minister @ianuragthakur @DrSJaishankar Calls For Removal of #Sikhs From @adgpi #IndianArmy#IndiaStandsWithChanni v/s #BharatStandsWithModiJi@madhavgk@NikunjGargN@anjujuneja@dibang@kumkum26pic.twitter.com/Q2P0tnB3aw Many social media handles have circulated the video with the same content, and demanding action and retaliation. The video source is credited to one Anjali Kaur (@heyanjaliii), which was created last year and has nearly 1,000 followers, and Esha Kaur. Fact check International Business Times reviewed the video in question. At first glance, it becomes clear that it has been morphed. Upon further research, it is evident how the video came into being. Check out the facts here. The video is doctored as the source of the audio doesn't match that of the video. This alone dismisses the claims that the Indian government is considering removing all Punjabis from the Indian Army. Upon research, the audio traces to a Clubhouse discussion. The voice is of one Vikas Dubey, it was he who had made the suggestion of removal of Punjabis from the Army. The recorded audio had already been circulated on various platforms, which had received strong criticism. But then, the audio was superimposed on the video of a cabinet meeting to create unrest. The original video is also a month old. It was when PM Modi called for a high-level Cabinet Committee meeting after the death of CDS General Bipin Rawat. CDS Gen Bipin Rawat's chopper crash: PM Modi chairs Cabinet Committee on Security meeting | Catch the day's latest news and updates: https://t.co/C4SeSvrNJu pic.twitter.com/JgDoCBVAdJ The origin of the doctored video is traced back to ISI information war rooms, creating provocative content in India. This is a serious disinformation attempt against India to destabilise the country at the time of vital elections in the border state of Punjab. Many verified handles were able to quickly flag the video as manipulated. Taking cognisance of the nature of the video, the official handle of Press Information Bureau (PIB) debunked the claims. As for the Twitter handle @heyanjaliii that shared the video, the timeline is clear evidence that it is being run by anti-India elements. Other handles like @diyaaaakhan, @SeejalKaur, @eshalkaur1, @keerat506 all of them clearly belong to ISI war rooms. After reviewing the evidence, IBTimes has arrived at the conclusion that the viral video is doctored. Hence, the government did not hold any meeting, where it called for the removal of Punjabis from the Indian Army.","

7,2021-12-27,20:07:13,society,fact-check,Fact check: Bank accounts of Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity not frozen by govt [truth here]," Serious allegations were levelled against the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) after reports of Missionaries of Charity's bank accounts being frozen emerged. The Centre was at the receiving end of severe backlash for freezing the bank accounts of Mother Teresa's charity organisation in India, as opposition leaders slammed the government. As these allegations gained ground, not only the MHA but the Missionaries of Charity (MoC) in India issued clarifications. While the claim that the bank accounts of MoC have been frozen are true, the Centre's role in it is unfounded. Read the whole story here. The claim When it was first reported earlier in the day that the bank accounts of Missionaries of Charity have been frozen by the government, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee slammed the Centre on Twitter. She wrote: ""Shocked to hear that on Christmas, Union Ministry FROZE ALL BANK ACCOUNTS of Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity in India! Their 22,000 patients & employees have been left without food & medicines. While the law is paramount, humanitarian efforts must not be compromised."" Banerjee, with her 6.4 million followers on Twitter, triggered a strong reaction. The tweet was re-shared and liked thousands of times as of this writing. While other leaders of opposition chimed in, a lot of users criticised the move by the government. Fact-check International Business Times reviewed the claims made by West Bengal CM and other users regarding the frozen bank accounts of Missionaries of Charity in India. Within hours of CM Mamata Banerjee's tweet, the MHA issued a statement clarifying the matter. Shortly after, Missionaries of Charity even released a statement. MHA official statement:  The renewal application under Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) for the renewal of FCRA registration of Missionaries of Charity (MoC) was refused on 25 Dec 2021 for not meeting the eligibility conditions under FCRA 2010 and Foreign Contribution Regulation Rules (FCRR) 2011. No request / revision application has been received from Missionaries of Charity (MoC) for review of this refusal of renewal. Missionaries of Charity (MoC) was registered under FCRA vide Registration No 147120001 and its registration was valid up-to 31 Oct 2021. The validity was subsequently extended up-to 31 Dec 2021 along with other FCRA Associations whose renewal application were pending renewal. However, while considering the MoC's renewal application, some adverse inputs were noticed. In consideration of these inputs on record, the renewal application of MoC was not approved. The FCRA registration of MoC was valid up-to 31st December 2021. MHA did not freeze any accounts of MoC. State Bank of India has informed that MoC itself sent a request to SBI to freeze its accounts. MoC official statement: We appreciate the concern of our well-wishers and extend our heartiest greetings for Christmas and the New Year. We would like to clarify that the FCRA registration of the Missionaries of Charity has been neither suspended or canceled. Further, there is no freeze ordered by the Ministry of Home Affairs on any of our bank accounts. We have been informed that our FCRA renewal application has not been approved. Therefore as a measure to ensure there is no lapse, we have asked our centres not to operate any of the FC accounts until the matter is resolved,"" the statement read. Based on these official statements, it is clear that the MHA did not freeze the accounts of Missionaries of Charity in India. Going by MHA's official statement, as per SBI, MoC sent a request to SBI to freeze its accounts, which is can be corroborated by MoC's statement, where it said that it has asked its centres not to operate any of the FC accounts until the matter is resolved. Due to some adverse inputs in the MoC's renewal application, it was not approved by the Centre. Hence, IBTimes has arrived at the conclusion based on the official statements by MHA and MoC that the Centre did not freeze any bank accounts of Missionaries of Charity in India.","

8,2021-12-14,01:10:49,society,fact-check,Fact check: Old video shared as Srinagar terror attack; goes viral with misleading context," In a shocking incident on Monday, two Jammu and Kashmir Police personnel were killed and 12 others injured by terrorists in the high-security Pantha Chowk area, on the outskirts of Srinagar city, on Monday. Two terrorists opened fire at the police bus from the front, shattering the vehicle's windshield. The terrorists then managed to escape after carrying out the dastardly attack. The injured police officials were evacuated to the 92 Base hospital. Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed condolences to the families of the policemen martyred in a terrorist attack on the outskirts of Srinagar on Monday and sought details on the incident. While the attack was widely condemned by the masses, there's a video showing injured jawans in a police bus, which is being passed off as the footage from the incident with misleading context. The claim The ghastly terrorist attack in Srinagar made the national headlines, with reactions flowing from across the country. Many videos and photos showing jawans storming the site of the incident site have appeared online. Photos even showed the shattered windshield of the police bus, but one particular video showing severely injured jawans near a police bus has gone viral saying it is from Monday's incident. The video is widely circulated in WhatsApp groups, claiming to show the injured personnel after the terrorist attack. Towards the end of the video, one personnel is seen with a critical bullet injury to the shoulder and not responding. Some local media houses and propaganda sites have also shared the video, and made similar claims that it was from Monday's incident Fact check International Business Times reviewed the footage, which is widely circulated on WhatsApp. If you look at the video, it appears a civilian recorded it. Many civilians can also be seen trying to help the injured officials, but the video doesn't show other army personnel, which is inconsistent with the official images and videos we've received. We ran a reverse image search of the video frames and found it linked to an old incident, when terrorists had attacked a police party at Pantha Chowk in Srinagar. The incident had occurred on eve of Eid on September 1, 2017. The police bus was going from Bemina to Zewan when terrorists opened fire. Lashkar-e-Toiba had claimed responsibility for the attack. You can watch the original video HERE [Trigger warning: graphic video], which was shared in September 2017.  Hence, IBTimes has arrived at the conclusion that the viral video being passed off as recent is in fact old and not related to Monday's terrorist attack in Srinagar.","

Agrawal's appointment was announced by Jack Dorsey, who decided to step down from the company. With this announcement, Agrawal's Twitter notifications must be blowing up as his followers rapidly multiplied in a matter of hours, currently standing at over 140,000. That's besides the congratulatory messages he's been receiving from all over the world. Meanwhile, some users dug up Agrawal's old tweets, wherein he was conversing with noted Bollywood singer Shreya Ghoshal, and were trolling the new Twitter boss. But it looks like people are reading too deep between the lines and stirring up unwanted controversy, instead of celebrating Agrawal's new success. The claim Several screenshots of Agrawal's old tweets are being circulated on Twitter. These tweets are basically of conversation that Agrawal had with Shreya Ghoshal several years ago. Netizens are stirring up controversies based on the friendly tweets shared between the Twitter chief and Bollywood playback singer.  Check out some of the tweets below: Fact check International Business Times went through some of the old tweets of Agrawal, where he mentioned Shreya Ghoshal. It appears people are singling out certain tweets without the actual context, using which they are making false assumptions like Agrawal is a hopeless fan of the singer. Agrawal and Shreya Ghoshal share a friendship, which dates back to several years. The duo are extremely close and their better halves share the same bond of friendship with each other. Agrawal is also pretty close to Shreya's husband Shiladitya Mukhopadhyaya, also a techie. The duo seem to share a close bond, be it catching up whenever they are in the same town or sharing updates on TV shows like Game of Thrones. Some netizens were quick to call out the misconceptions about Shreya and Agrawal's friendship.  In fact, when the appointment of Agrawal as Twitter CEO was confirmed, Shreya was among the first ones to congratulate the IIT man. Going by the tweets between Agrawal and Shreya, it's clear that the two share a good friendship. Like any other friends, they would like to hit each other up on social media and these exchanges are just friendly banter, nothing more.","

The government of J&K has already ordered a probe into the incident. But this video has been shared with its origins in Pakistan to Kashmir-based Facebook and WhatsApp groups deliberately with a motive to incite violence and fan public anger with respect to the Hyderpora encounter. Here's the truth behind the viral video. The recent Hyderpora encounter, in which three civilians were allegedly killed has triggered a controversy while also giving ammunition to anti-national forces to malign the Indian security forces. PAK's ISI-sponsored groups were recently exposed for spitting venom against nationalist Kashmiri Muslims, govt employees and security forces, in a move to disrupt the peace and harmony in the valley. Now, those same groups are misleading the people of Kashmir by slandering the Indian Army using a video. The claim A video of Indian Army personnel consuming alcohol at an unidentified camp has been shared on social media with a misleading context that links it to the Hyderpora encounter. The video titled ""Indian Army Drinking alcohol before the Killings Of Innocent Kashmiris in Hyderpora Srinagar"" has been viewed over 1.6 lakh times on Facebook and sparked outrage. Hundreds of users have expressed their discontent towards the video based on the misleading context, while some have flagged it off as fake. The video shows army jawans taking sips of rum and making merry. Fact check International Business Times reviewed the video and the context with which it has been shared on social media. We dug deeper to find out the truth behind the video. The video does not reveal the location or have a timestamp to clearly establish that it was shot before the Hyderpora encounter, which was the first red flag worth noting. The Facebook page ""Kashmir Express,"" where the video was shared is not verified and has largely remained inactive ever since it was created in 2018. Not more than 1,500 people follow the page, which is listed in the Product/Service category. There is an email address on the account, which is not linked to any social media account. However speaking to sources in the armed forces, IBTimes was able to independently verify that the video is of troops of the Indian Army but from a completely unrelated location and exercise. This video is being shared by Pakistan-based elements on Facebook and WhatsApp groups in J&K to fuel public anger and mislead them. The public in Kashmir is being fed such disinformation by using an under-inquiry encounter and the nefarious designs want to use the Hyderpora incident and ride the sympathy wave by obfuscating facts. In this video, we were able to confirm that the troops were fatigued on de-induction after they returned from an arduous exercise. The soldiers were entirely wet and cold. Therefore, warm food and rum issue was planned for them after the debriefing by their immediate seniors. It's a routine off-duty fun moment for the jawans who work on hectic schedules. We are not sharing the exact location of where the video due to it being a defense-related matter. Hence, IBTimes has arrived at the conclusion that the viral video of Indian Army officials engaging in retreat is not related to the Hyderpora encounter and the controversial claim is false and misleading. Update: Soon after IBT verified this claim and found it false, the same was raised with the Facebook page admin who uploaded this content. After seeing the IBT fact-check, the same was immediately removed by the admin, the said Page was deleted and here's their response: I got this video from one of my friends on the day when Hyderpora encounter happened,"" (sic) the admin said.  The fact that it was deleted and the person running the page revealed how he came to post it, clearly shows how Pakistan's nefarious designs work in J&K and how they take criminal advantage of public anger.","

Many news reports had confirmed that the national-level wrestler was shot dead along with her brother in Sonepat, Haryana, only to be revealed later that the news was fake. The claim Several media reports and Twitter users broke the news about national-level wrestler Nisha Dahiya's tragic death in Haryana on Wednesday. According to the reports, Nisha and her brother were shot dead by unknown assailants at the Sushil Kumar Wrestling Academy in Sonepat's Halalpur, Haryana. The reports further speculated that her mother was critically injured and hospitalised for further treatment. Many verified Twitter handles shared the news of Nisha's death, mourning the athlete's death. Fact check International Business Times checked the official sources to confirm if the reports about Nisha's death are true. Shortly after the news spread like wildfire on social media, Wrestling Federation of India released a video message to debunk the ongoing rumours. ""Hello, my name is Nisha. I have come to play senior nationals (tournament) in Gonda, and I am totally fine. And it (the news of her death) is fake news. I am totally fine,"" wrestler Nisha Dahiya can be seen saying in a video issued by Wrestling Federation of India.

Thank you and let's keep hoping and wishing for her long life, good health and success. pic.twitter.com/cYbwU3W8sS Wrestler Sakshi Malik also took to Twitter to confirm that Dahiya is safe. The Inspire Institute of Sport further issued a clarification on the matter, confirming that Nisha is safe. ""The Inspire Institute of Sport would like to clarify that its athlete, Nisha Dahiya, who bagged Bronze at the recently concluded World U23 Championships in Belgrade, is NOT the wrestler who was involved in the unfortunate incident in Sonepat earlier today,"" IIS said in a tweet. ""Nisha is safe and well, and continues to prepare for the Senior National Wrestling Championships, set to take place in Gonda, Uttar Pradesh. Our sincere condolences go out to the victim and members of her family,"" IIS added. The Haryana Police shed light on the actual incident that happened. It was a trainee wrestler named Nisha Dahiya (21), and her brother, Suraj, who were tragically shot dead by the coach of the wrestling institute she was receiving training in. In addition, her mother was left injured and receiving treatment in PGI Hospital, Rohtak, Haryana Police confirmed.

12,2021-11-08,18:36:08,society,fact-check,Fact check: Pfizer CEO not arrested; false report reeks of anti-vaccine propaganda [details]," Just a few days ago, US drugmaker Pfizer dominated the headlines with the announcement of its new antiviral pill against Covid-19 can significantly reduce hospitalizations and deaths. Pfizer's pill named Paxlovid can reduce the risk of hospitalization and death by 89 percent for adults at high risk of developing the severe disease when it was given within three days of symptoms appearing, the company said in a statement. Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer, called it a ""real game-changer."" The pill has the potential to save lives and eventually put an end to this pandemic. But a report claiming Pfizer CEO got arrested for fraud came down heavily on people who were excited about Pfizer's recent news. The claim A Canadian website called Conservative Beaver published an exclusive report, making some bold claims about Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla's arrest. According to the report, Bourla was arrested by the FBI on November 5 for fraud. The report also claimed that the police ordered a blackout on media reportage based on an order from a judge, citing this as the reasoning for the incident not being reported globally. ""According to an FBI agent that spoke to the Conservative Beaver, Pfizer lied about the effectiveness of the vaccines, and mislead [sic] customers about the serious side effects the vaccines can produce. Pfizer is accused of paying off governments and the mainstream media to stay silent,"" the report said. The report of this arrest was widely circulated on social media, mostly by anonymous accounts. This made the report go viral, and many believed it to be true. Fact check International Business Times reviewed the claims made by the Canadian website about Pfizer CEO's arrest. Except for this one report, no other local or international newspapers have reported the news of Bourla's arrest, which is just as surprising as it is suspicious. Going through the article, it becomes clear that there are no facts or evidence to support the bold claims, photos or videos or even an official statement confirming the arrest. To further corroborate the story, we found Bourla's interview from November 5 with CNBC, which is the same day Conservative Beaver published the report. There was no commotion or mention of Bourla's arrest or him being implicated in any way. Even with a media blackout order, it would have been impossible to contain such a big story from getting out. The exclusive tag sticks here, no one else even ran to cover the story as it reeks of anti-vaccine propaganda. Conservative Beaver is known for its anti-vaccine views, going so far as to even generate sensationalizing fake news that deceives readers about the effectiveness of vaccines. Many people called out the fake report for what it is. After reviewing all the evidence, IBTimes has arrived at the conclusion that reports of Pfizer CEO's arrest are false.","

But recent reports claimed that the Asia's richest man was planning to partly move to London, where he bought a lavish estate, along with his family. The reports about 300-acre Stoke Park estate being the Ambanis' second home away from Mumbai made the headlines, and to that extent RIL issued a statement setting the record straight. The claim Many reports claimed citing sources that Mukesh Ambani bought another home in London, where he along with his family will be spending a lot of time. Stoke Park, the heritage property in London's Buckinghamshire was rumoured to be the family's new home in UK. According to reports, the Ambanis bought the massive property as they would be spending at least 6 months a year there. The reports went on to claim that Mukesh Ambani purchased the estate for Rs 592 crore earlier this year and planned to move into their new home in April next year. The reports also claimed that the Ambanis even built a temple on the property and a priest was taken from India. The reports of Ambani's purchase went viral, highlighting the facts about Stoke Park, which was featured in two James Bond films. Fact check International Business Times reviewed the claims about the Ambani family partly moving to London. Citing the influx of reports, Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) issued a statement clarifying the unverified reports. ""Reliance Industries Limited will like to clarify that the Chairman and his family have no plans whatsoever to relocate or reside in London or anywhere else in the world,"" read the official statement. Further clarifying about the purchase of Stoke Park estate, the company said that the acquisition is aimed at enhancing it as a premier golfing and sporting resort. RIL group company, RIIHL, which acquired Stoke Park estate recently, would like to clarify that its acquisition of the heritage property is aimed at enhancing this as a premier golfing and sporting resort, while fully complying with the planning guidelines and local regulations,"" the statement added. ""This acquisition will add to the fast-growing consumer business of the group. Simultaneously, it will also expand the footprint of India's famed hospitality industry globally,"" RIL said.

Social media is abuzz with an image of PM Modi getting inside a taxi after he met the Pope in Vatican. The claim Several users on Twitter have shared an image of PM Modi boarding a taxi as he was departing after meeting Pope Francis in Vatican. In the image, a Volkswagen Passat with a taxi plate on top can be seen parked as the Indian PM is seen getting inside. The image went viral in no time, with many taking a dig at the PM for using a taxi in Italy without his own motorcade. In some photos, the taxi plate was under the license plate of the car. Fact check International Business Times reviewed the claims and the viral photo on social media. We did a reverse image search of the viral image to see the original source and found the image to be fake. Many news outlets shared pictures of PM Modi arriving in Vatican to meet the Pope in a Volkswagen Passat. The original image of PM Modi boarding the Passat before after meeting the Pope was tweeted by ANI on Saturday and the car did not have a taxi plate on it. Upon a closer look, the colour of the taxi nameplate can clearly be seen superimposed on the original image. The colour of the photoshopped ""taxi"" plate is richer in contrast compared to the rest of the image. Also, the stand holding the taxi plate clearly looks photoshopped and it is positioned in the wrong place. Also, if you look at the car behind, the taxi plate has been photoshopped and it's not even centered. Pope Francis received Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a private audience at the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican on Saturday, the first such meeting between an Indian Prime Minister and the head of the Catholic Church in more than two decades. Modi was accompanied by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and External Affairs Minister, Dr S. Jaishankar. The Prime Minister also extended an invitation to Pope Francis to visit India at an early date, which was accepted with pleasure, it added.

15,2021-10-08,23:26:41,society,fact-check,Fact check: Bihar vendor's family had full govt support; chose to cremate body in Srinagar [details]," A non-local vendor, who was selling Golgappas in Lal Bazar area of Srinagar city, was shot dead on October 5 by terrorists as the targeted killings intensified in the valley. The deceased was identified as Virender Paswan, a resident of Bhagalpur in Bihar, who was living in Alamgari Bazar in Zadibal. The local Islamic State module claimed responsibility for the brutal killing of the street hawker and even released a video on social media, which shows the terrorist walking behind Paswan and murdering him in cold blood. Paswan was cremated at Karan Nagar cremation grounds in Srinagar on Wednesday afternoon, in which the victim's brothers and locals participated to perform the last rites. But the Bihar resident's cremation in Srinagar has become a heated topic of discussion on social media, drawing flak towards the administration for not making the necessary arrangements to fly the body to his native. The claim Many netizens, including journalists and activists as well as some politicians, have raised their voice in protest. Many are claiming that Paswan's family was forced to cremate the victim's body in Srinagar as they couldn't afford to take the body to Bhagalpur in Bihar. The administration was condemned for not making the transport arrangements for the deceased and his family. As per one claim, the state administration had reportedly offered to airlift Paswan's body till Patna, which was then turned down by a relative as they could not afford to take the body from Patna Airport to Bhagalpur. Last rites of the victim of Targeted Killing, Virendra Paswan were held in Srinagar, as the family could not afford to take his body to Bhagalpur, Bihar from Kashmir...Tragic!!@NitishKumar @News18Bihar pic.twitter.com/p8kQ29D52p Social media is abuzz with criticism towards the J&K administration for not taking the necessary steps to support Paswan's bereaved family at a sensitive time. Fact-check International Business Times reviewed the claims made by many users, including several verified accounts on Twitter, and reached out to the administration to seek clarity on the matter. It is worth noting that the District Administration Srinagar on Wednesday provided an ex-gratia relief of Rs 1.25 lakh to the next-of-kin of Paswan. Mohammed Aijaz Asad, Deputy Commissioner of Srinagar, had handed over cheques of Rs 1 lakh to the family under SDRF and Rs 25,000 under Red Cross fund to the deceased's wife Putul Devi. Separately, the J&K government provided additional relief amount of Rs 5 lakh on Friday, taking the total compensation to Rs 6.25 lakh. Pawan Paswan, the deceased's relative in Srinagar, who's also a street hawker, had said that the family decided to do the cremation in Srinagar after due deliberations. He further said that the J&K government offered all the help and had even made arrangements to fly the body to Bihar. However, due to lack of manpower, the family decided to hold the victim's last rites in Srinagar. Junaid Azim Mattoo, the Mayor of Srinagar, debunked the misinformation about the family not being provided the support to transport the deceased's body to his native. ""I've been informed that free air tickets, as well as arrangements for the body, were offered by the District Administration but the family chose for the cremation to happen in Srinagar,"" Mattoo tweeted on Wednesday. International Business Times has even reached out to DC Srinagar for a statement but at the time of publishing this copy, his response was still awaited. Going by the facts available, it is clear that claims about Virendra Paswan's family not getting financial or any other support to take the deceased's body to his native Bhagalpur in Bihar are unfounded.","

The US visit is widely seen as a productive one with PM Modi holding bilateral talks with US President Joe Biden, participating in Quad summit and also addressing the United Nations General Assembly. But some unscrupulous factions are trying to malign PM Modi's image by spreading demeaning content. Claim An image has gone viral on social media, which shows the front page of The New York Times print edition dated today. The lead article on the NYT page is on PM Modi, with a picture of him signing a document. The article carries the headline: ""Last, Best Hope of Earth"" and it is followed by a summary, which reads: ""World's most loved and most powerful leader, is here to bless us."" This image of the NYT article has gone viral on social media, with many users sharing it widely assuming the article is praising the Indian Prime Minister. Fact check International Business Times reviewed the viral image of PM Modi on the front page of NYT and found that The New York Times hasn't published the article. In fact, there are many red flags in the image that goes on to prove that the article is fake. Firstly, if you look closely, the spelling of the month ""September"" is wrong. Secondly, the language of the viral article image makes it look suspicious. For instance, right below the article is a sentence that reads: ""His Highness, Modiji is signing on a blank a4 paper to bless our country... har har mahadev."" The grammatical errors and poorly-framed sentences with snarky references are unlike the standards of the NYT. We ran a reverse image search to find PM Modi's photo of signing a document, which brings up several articles on PM Modi but none of them source back to NYT. The original source of the image is Narendra Modi's official website.  Meanwhile, the actual front page of NYT's Sunday, September 26 edition is shown below: Speaking to IBTimes regarding the nature of the viral image on social media, Prem Bhandari, a prominent voice of NRI's based out of NYC, said: ""It is so unfortunate to see some unscrupulous elements unsuccessfully trying to malign the image of one of the strongest PM's India has ever had. I condemn it. Such people try to demean what India has achieved globally in terms of respect and power under PM Modi. But these also mean that our PM is successful that unscrupulous elements have to indulge in such despicable acts since they've nothing that they can use against him."" Hence, IBTimes has arrived at the conclusion that the viral image of NYT front page about PM Modi is untrue and it is clearly meant for mischief.","

The ministry ordered to provide cash payment and gratuity along with Dearness Allowance (DA) benefits to retired central government employees. In an attempt to wreck the excitement around this great news, a false report claimed that the central government might be considering stopping pension for its employees after the age of 70-75 years. The claim A Bengali newspaper called Bartaman Patrika had published a report saying the central government is considering stoppage of pension for its retired employees after the age of 70-75 years. The report further claimed that central government pensioners would be paid a lump sum amount, which will only be 40-60 percent of their pension amount. In addition, there would also be no Dearness Relief on the same. Naturally, the proposal drew a lot of backlash after it was picked up by other newspapers. Netizens also pointed out how this move would be unfair to pensioners who served in the central government. Fact check International Business Times reviewed the claims made in the report, which was dated 13 September, 2021, and later picked up by another English daily. The finance ministry, as recently as this week, poured water on all the claims made in the local reports, there was no mention of any proposal moved or under consideration to stop the pension for central government employees after the age of 70-75 years.

19,2021-09-10,01:44:38,society,fact-check,Fact check: Doctor spreading COVID misinformation not dean of Mumbai hospital [truth here]," COVID-19 virus has claimed millions of lives around the world, ravaged economies and struck the worst health crisis the world has seen in recent times. Despite the evident danger humanity faces from this dreaded strain of coronavirus, there are some people who are spreading misinformation about COVID-19, going as far as claiming that the entire pandemic is a sham and that face masks are not only ineffective, they also pose a health risk. The truth couldn't be further from such claims. Now a video is going viral on social media of one ""doctor"" who is encouraging people to ditch face masks and claims COVID-19 is nothing more than a flu. The claim A viral video of Dr Tarun Kothari, dean of Mumbai's Nair Hospital as the caption claims, is seen making claims about COVID-19 to a group of people surrounding him. As per the users sharing the video on social media groups, the video was shot during a peaceful protest at Gurudwara Bangla Sahib in New Delhi. The video, at least a month old, continues to make the rounds on Telegram, Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp. In the video, Dr Kothari can be heard claiming wearing face masks reduces oxygen level in the body, which in turn makes people ill. He can also be heard saying that vaccine is killing more people than COVID-19. Finally, in the viral video, Dr Kothari claims COVID-19 is merely a flu and deaths are extremely unlikely. Watch video HERE Fact check International Business Times came across the video of Dr Tarun Kothari, which is being shared in various social media groups. Upon investigation, we found many red flags not just in the video, but the designation of Dr Kothari. This video has been in circulation since July this year. Contrary to the caption of the video, Dr Kothari, in July, had clarified to BOOM that he is not associated with Mumbai's BYL Nair Hospital. In fact, he is a radiologist based in Delhi and runs a diagnostic centre called Indo-American Health Care in New Delhi's Paschim Vihar area. His LinkedIn profile says he did his MBBS from Dr Sampurnanand Medical College and MD from Ravindra Nath Tagore Medical College, Udaipur. As for the sensational claims made by Dr Kothari in the viral video, none of them are backed by scientific evidence. No, wearing face mask does not reduce oxygen level in the body. In fact, World Health Organisation recommends wearing face mask to control the spread of the virus. No, vaccine isn't killing people. India's cumulative COVID-19 vaccination coverage has crossed 72 crore landmark milestone. There's no evidence to prove that vaccine is killing people, except for one case where a person died due to anaphylaxis after getting the jab. As for the claim about COVID-19 being a simple flu, COVID is caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus whereas seasonal flu is the work of influenza virus. Flu has a mortality rate of 0.1 percent, much lower than that of COVID, which is above 2 percent. Based on these facts, IBTimes has arrived at the conclusion that COVID claims made by Dr Tarun Kothari are false and baseless. Moreover, he is not the dean of Mumbai's Nair Hospital.","

Those who tried to use senior Kashmir leader's death for their petty gains are now continuing efforts, even more so after realizing that law and order prevailed in the valley. Once again, Pakistan is using Geelani's death to stir up misplaced feelings among Kashmiri youth. The claim Kashmiri Facebook groups are sharing images of Geelani, including ones that are being claimed to be of the Kashmiri leader when he was young. The picture doing the rounds on social media and on WhatsApp claims it is a ""rare picture of young Geelani taken away by Indian armed forces."" The sepia photograph has been shared thousands of times on Facebook, WhatsApp, and other social media platforms with the same caption. The photograph is being shared to instigate an emotional and anti-national response in the wake of Geelani's death. Fact check International Business Times reviewed the claims and found them to be false. First of all, the picture has gone viral with the wrong claim. The man accompanied by officials in the uniform is not the deceased leader, Geelani. Moreover, by the uniform worn by the officers accompanying the man, it is clear that they are Pakistan police. A simple image reverse search on the web of the viral photograph reveals the true identity of the person in the image. It is Sardar Attaullah Mengal, the first elected CM of Balochistan. The image was not picked out randomly as it was already in circulation on Twitter. Mengal died on September 2, and many users shared this image while expressing condolences, making it go viral. Some miscreants shared this image and made it go viral with the wrong context in hopes to disrupt peace in J&K. Some users were quick to debunk the false identity. Since Pakistan failed to use his death to create new unrest in Kashmir, now this is seen as a soft attempt to peddle misplaced and unfounded anger.","

The Bengaluru-based company became a victim and the intent behind the message was so intense, iD Fresh Food had to issue a statement debunking the claims. The claim A viral WhatsApp forward made some wild allegations against iD Fresh Food, which paints a communal colour. The message claims the company ""only hires Muslims"" and is ""halal certified."" The message is also accompanied by a link to a 2014 fundraising announcement of Rs 35 crore, claiming it was the country's first VC deal to strictly adhere to ""Shariah Islamic Law."" The message goes on to claim that the company mixes ""cow bones and calf rennet"" to make volume of the batter. Fact check International Business Times reviewed the claims circulating on WhatsApp and social media. Due to the viral nature of the message, iD Fresh issued a statement slamming the fake propaganda. iD Fresh Food items do not use any animal extracts and is completely vegetarian. ""We would like to clearly specify that iD uses only vegetarian ingredients to make its products, iD Idly Dosa Batter is made from rice, urad dal, fenugreek and RO water only, which are 100% natural and vegetarian agri-commodities. There are no animal extracts used in any of our products,"" ID Fresh Foods said in the statement. ""We proudly manufacture healthy and authentic Indian products with no chemicals or preservatives inside our world-class, state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities that fully comply with the Food Safety Management System. Such baseless and fake propaganda is unfortunate and it undermines the trust of millions of ID customers,"" the statement added. iD Fresh, established in 2005, now sell their products in Mysuru, Mangaluru, Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam, Rajahmundry, Chennai, Ernakulam, Coimbatore, Cochin, and abroad as well, in Sharjah, Abu Dhabi and Dubai.

It has been awarded Food Safety System Certification (FSSC) 22000 for its manufacturing plants in Mumbai, Hyderabad and Dubai, which is given only after a thorough comprehensive audit, which is proof that the communal WhatsApp forward doesn't hold any water. Hence, IBTimes has arrived at the conclusion that claims about iD Fresh mixing animal extracts is completely false and baseless.","

22,2021-09-02,02:11:15,society,fact-check,Fact-Check: How Pakistan's ISI used Syed Ali Geelani even after his death [exposed]," Pakistan favoring separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani passed away at his Hyderpora residence in Srinagar on Wednesday. The senior secessionist leader breathed his last at his Hyderpora residence at 10:35 p.m. His passing has triggered a wave of disinformation sponsored by Pakistan's ISI with an aim to disrupt peace in the valley. The claim A viral letter claiming to be the ""plans"" of SAS Geelani's last rites is going viral on social media. One ISI man who is known for peddling lies for Pakistan in Kashmir has shared a letter. The fake and old letter expects the people of Kashmir to take part in the funeral procession of the Hurriyat leader and provides a route plan. In the letter, the route plan for people to attend the last rites of Geelani are mentioned, which covers Central Kashmir, Ganderbal, Budgam, North Kashmir, South Kashmir, Pir Panchal, Chenab Valley, Jammu and Ladakh. As per the claims made in the letter, the ""namaz-e-janaza"" or the funeral prayer is to be held in open ground. Additionally, many other accounts are also claiming that journalists are not being allowed to cover the last rites of Geelani. Fact check In view of SAS Geelani's death, the ISI-sponsored factions have started actively spreading disinformation on social media. International Business Times has reviewed these claims and found them baseless and false. Here's a detailed report of the claims made by these nefarious Twitter handles peddled. IBTimes had in the recent past busted the ISI man's nefarious disinformation designs and exposed his lies. As for the letter shared by one Muzammil Ayyub Thakur, who is a UK citizen living in London and claims to be an expert on Kashmir and its matters, is dated February 12, 2020. Someone forgot reminding them that it's 2021 already. And Geelani was alive in 2020. So that pokes holes in their first social post and claims. Pakistan's disinformation section is active in full swing and many Pakistanis posing as Kashmiris are busy spreading lies. Here's one example: It is clear by the text in the above tweets that these are templates picked out of the ISI-peddled toolkit to spread disinformation. These tweets by ISI-sponsored Pakistani nationals are proof that they won't even spare a dead Geelani and milk his death for their petty politicking. These people sitting and tweeting from Pakistan claim that media was not allowed near Geelani's house. Unfortunately for them, we found many media persons outside his residence. In this context, the IGP Kashmir Police Vijay Kumar is clearly seen in the video talking to local journalists and has stated that restrictions have been imposed in the valley and only the relatives of Geelani would be allowed to visit the family. Restrictions, including suspension of internet services, have been imposed in Kashmir Valley. Security has also been strengthened outside Geelani's house in Hyderpora. Restrictions imposed in valley. Only relatives would be allowed to vist the family : IGP Kashmir Police outside the residence of Syed Ali Shah Geelani. pic.twitter.com/xrUo10h2Sb Given the 2020 letter, it is also clear how ISI-sponsored people on social media have been waiting for Geelani's passing since Feb 2020 especially. Based on these facts, IBTimes has arrived at the conclusion that all the claims made about the plan to converge for Geelani's last rites and reports of journalists not being allowed to cover the last rites of Geelani are peddled with malicious intent — hence fake.","

24,2021-08-18,00:23:32,society,fact-check,Fact-check: Old pic of Philippines evacuation shared as Afghans rescued by Air Force [truth here]," The Afghanistan takeover by the Taliban has caused chaos in the country as well as abroad. The headlines are changing as the situation evolves by the hour. Photos and videos of people trying to flee the country has sent shockwaves across the world, and there are rescue operations underway from different countries, including India. One particular photo has gone viral on social media as Indian users have shared a photo of a packed C-17 aircraft, claiming to be of 800 Afghanis airlifted from Kabul. The claim Many Indian users are sharing a photo showing the inside of a cargo aircraft, which is packed with hundreds of people crammed into the closed space. The photo is shared with the caption, which claims the Indian Air Force airlifted 800 people from Kabul. ""IAF C 17 with 800 people airlifted....a record. That's a train load almost. The previous highest was 670. This is from Kabul Airport this morning,"" the posts read. The posts also claim that the IAF, in doing so, has set a record, surpassing the previous highest of 670 people. The posts claimed that the IAF C-17 aircraft was inbound India from Kabul airport. After the viral videos showing people holding on to moving planes, massive crowds at Kabul Airport tarmac, the photo of a packed C-17 aircraft was received with little doubt. In fact, many lauded India for the rescue efforts and standing by the Afghan citizens at the time of crisis. Fact check International Business Times reviewed the claims made. Although India is also participating in evacuating people stranded in Afghanistan as a part of its ongoing efforts, the image shared by many users online is totally unrelated. We explain how. Firstly, when you zoom into the image, not a single person is seen wearing traditional Afghani attire. The people in the aircraft look East Asian and not West Asian. Digging deeper, a reverse image search of the image shows the photo first appeared in 2013. The Pacific Air Forces, Major Command of the United States Air Force, had published the image on December 17, 2013, when it had airlifted 670 Tacloban residents on a C-17 Globemaster III following Super Typhoon Haiyan, which hit the Philippines Nov. 17, 2013. Since both the US and India had sent C-17 aircraft for evacuation from Kabul, many people easily believed this viral image to be related to the ongoing operation. However, the photo from 2013 is being falsely shared with false context. IBTimes has arrived at the conclusion that IAF did not airlift 800 Afghans from Kabul in a C-17 aircraft and an old photo is being shared with misleading context.","

While future of the country is at the hands of Taliban, shocking news reports of people fleeing the country in fear of Taliban rule have shocked the entire world. Amidst all this, a viral screenshot from CNN grabbed the attention of many as the television network appeared to have praised Taliban. The claim The screengrab of CNN news telecast with the headline ""Taliban Fighters Responsibly Wearing Masks"" went viral on social media after many verified accounts circulated the image on Twitter. Drawing criticism towards the TV network, many netizens lashed out at CNN for praising the Taliban. One such account that shared the viral image is of Vivek Ranjan Agnihotri, which garnered nearly 7,000 likes as of this writing. Agnihotri credited the image to stand-up comedian Joe Rogan's post on Instagram, which was actually a repost from parody account The Babylon Bee. Similarly, film producer Ashoke Pandit shared the same image to attract over 200 likes, but shared it believing the article was real. Many other verified accounts shared the image, making it go viral with a context that is different from what was intended. Fact check International Business Times reviewed the claims and tracked the original source of the image, which traced to The Babylon Bee. The article with CNN's logo can also be found at the official website of BabylonBee, which calls itself a satire site that is ""totally inerrant in all its truth claims"". The site's Twitter bio reads: ""Fake news you can trust"". All this clearly points to the fact that the viral image claiming CNN praised Taliban is fake and satire in nature. The CNN logo was clearly photoshopped along with the ticker headline. As for the image showing Taliban members, an image-reverse search shows that it was originally published in a BBC article in 2012. The photo was taken in 2007. Given the ongoing Afghanistan crisis and the Taliban at the centre of it all, the satire image has gone viral. Based on these facts, IBTimes has arrived at the conclusion that CNN did not praise Taliban for wearing masks.","

Despite it, the disinformation mill continues to be fuelled by fake and misleading videos to disrupt the prevailing peace and harmony in J&K. IBTimes now debunks two such videos circulated with malicious intent.

In one video, a Pakistan national flag can be seen at the fence of Jamia Masjid in Srinagar. With the video, Ayyub Thakur claims ""the people have spoken"".

The first video shared by Thakur, which shows a Pakistan flag on the fence of Jamia Masjid in Srinagar is an old one. IBTimes ground staff went to the location to confirm that no such flag has been raised at Jamia Masjid. The second video of ""Naya Kadal"" which shows people celebrating Pakistan Independence Day is also old and the context is misleading. IBTimes ground staff was able to debunk both these videos.

With this announcement, the fake news mill gained momentum as a viral WhatsApp message claims to have accessed the list of Padma Awardees before the official announcement. The claim A viral WhatsApp message includes a PDF list of Padma Shri winners of 2021 along with a message that reads: ""No Bollywood actor, no Cricketer, no politician, but ONLY down to earth people - who live and work for other people."" The list includes 15 names of social workers, who have contributed towards the welfare of the people and the society in one way or the other. They include: This list, along with short bio of the social workers, has gone viral on WhatsApp, which has already flagged the message as ""forwarded many times."" Fact check International Business Times, like many WhatsApp users, came across this list. Given the timing of the government's announcement for nomination for Padma Awards, the Padma Shri awardees list was received by many with little doubt. But a simple Google search reveals the truth. Visiting the official government dashboard for Padma Awardees gives a list of all the recipients of the Padma Shri. Going through the list revealed to us that the 15 names have been picked from 118 recipients of Padma Shri in 2020. The claim made with the viral list on WhatsApp is also misleading as it claims to be 2021 list. But anyone who goes through the list can easily tell that the names are from last year as it clearly mentions in every person's bio. In addition to that, Press Information Bureau Fact Check team debunked the misinformation regarding Padma Awards 2021 recipients and labeled it misleading. The Padma Awards are conferred on the recommendations made by the Padma Awards Committee, which is constituted by the Prime Minister every year. The nomination process is open to the public. Even self-nomination can be made.

This has remained a sensitive topic despite vast developments seen in the valley in the last two years. The abrogation of Article 370 has irked Pakistan and PAK-sympathisers to an extent that each year, there are fake rumours circulated with an aim to instigate violence in the UT. This year, it's a fake letter signed by Hurriyat leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani. The claim A viral photo of SAS Geelani's letter has been doing the rounds on the internet. In the letter, written in Urdu, SAS Geelani is believed to be calling for strike on August 5 and August 15, two important dates in J&K. On August 5, 2019, the Article 370 abrogation was signed and August 15 is Independence Day on which separatists have been calling for a strike ever since insurgency erupted in 1989. The letter mentions the two dates and calls for UT-wide protests in a provocative language. Fact check International Business Times reviewed the contents of letter, which is going viral on social media and in WhatsApp groups. Taking cognisance of the viral letter, J&K Police was swift to act and dismiss it as fake. ""Police are taking action against those who are circulating it to instigate violence. Case FIR under relevant sections of ULA (P) stands registered in Police station Budgam,"" police said, in a tweet. Geelani's family sources also denied issuing the press release calling for strike on August 5 and August 15 in Kashmir.

The rumours about Aramco starting Bitcoin mining garnered global interest, to such a scale that the oil conglomerate had to issue a statement to set the record straight. The claim It all started off with a recent interview with Brazilian bitcoin miner Ray Nasser, where he claimed that negotiations were ongoing with Aramco to get the oil giant involved in Bitcoin mining activities. Nasser claimed the natural gas Aramco burns off prior to oil extraction through the process of flaring could be used for Bitcoin mining. ""We are negotiating with Aramco. All black liquid [oil] that comes out of the desert belongs to this company. All the flared gas they're not using, and that's public information, I can tell you, it's enough to 'power up' half of the bitcoin network today, from this company alone,"" Nasser had reportedly said. Since Aramco's links to blockchain aren't a secret, including investment of $5 million in blockchain-based oil trading company Vakt, and its subsidiary being a part of a $6 million deal with Data Gumbo Corp for developing a commercial blockchain network, Nasser's remarks spread like wildfire. Fact check Mining Bitcoins requires a massive amount of energy, which Aramco has in abundance. Seeing how the news of Aramco starting Bitcoin mining spread, the oil giant issued a statement to dismiss those rumours. ""With reference to recent reports claiming that the company will embark on Bitcoin mining activities, Aramco confirms that these claims are completely false and inaccurate,"" said the Dhahran-based group. Moreover, the links between Aramco's investments in blockchain as a technology has nothing to do with Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general. It uses blockchain tech to standardise business processes with the aim to increase efficiency and reduce costs. The investments in Data Gumbo and Vakt help Aramco in the management and automation of new contracts and invoices. Hence, International Business Times has arrived at the conclusion that the rumours about Aramco starting Bitcoin mining are false.","

Yediyurappa submitted his resignation to Governor Thawarchand Gehlot on Monday after tweeting that it was an honour for him to have served the state for two years. Amidst all the big headlines, there are some reports highlighting Yediyurappa's past political journey and one claim in all that is rather misleading. The claim As talks about BSY's journey gain momentum, there are some reports stating he was the first sitting chief minister to go to jail. These reports are in reference to 2011, when Yediyurappa was arrested on the charges of using his office as Chief Minister to making land in and around Bengaluru available to his family at a phenomenal bargain. In July 2011, Yediyurappa was indicted in the Lokayukta report in illegal mining. With BSY's resignation after assuming the office of the Chief Minister of Karnataka for two years, these older incidents are coming to light as a review of Yediyurappa's political journey. Many users on Twitter are claiming that he was the ""first CM to go to jail."" Fact check International Business Times reviewed the claims made on Twitter and in WhatsApp groups about Yediyurappa being the first CM to go to jail with reference to his arrest made in 2011. Simply by going over the timeline of BSY's arrest, it becomes clear that the claim is misleading. When Yediyurappa was indicted in a report on illegal mining in July, he resigned as the state chief minister soon after. Yediyurappa was arrested on October 15, and released 25 days later. At the time of his arrest, BS Yediyurappa was not the CM, he was an ex-CM. Sadananda Gowda was the chief minister of Karnataka at the time. Based on the timeline of events, IBTimes has arrived at the conclusion that the claims about Yediyurappa being the first CM to go to jail are false.","

33,2021-07-18,15:24:53,society,fact-check,Fact check: Woman dragged down UP cop by his collar; video shows what happened," Police brutality is heavily frowned upon, but it appears that's not what happened in UP's Kanpur Dehat district. An Uttar Pradesh police officer was accused of overpowering a woman as photos of the incident went viral on social media, drawing flak towards the police and the BJP-led government in the state. Now, a video has surfaced that shows what exactly happened. The claim Photographs of the UP cop sitting on top of the woman have gone viral on the social media. The incident reportedly took place on Saturday. The cop in the picture was accused of overpowering a woman, by pinning her to the ground and hitting her as he sat on top of her in Kanpur Dehat district. According to reports, sub-inspector Mahendra Patel had an altercation with the woman in Durgadaspur village while he was looking for Shivam Yadav, who according to the police, had threatened a candidate in the panchayat elections. Yadav's wife, Aarti spoke to the media, while accusing the police officer of slapping her and hitting her badly after sitting atop her. She said the villagers intervened and rescued her. The incident drew strong reactions and the UP police received a lot of flak. Fact check International Business Times reviewed the claims made on social media and corroborated the same with official statements issued by the police. The police official said that Yadav was gambling with a few friends and was caught by the police but his mother and wife clung to him which led to a scuffle between Patel and the women. They also said that Yadav's wife, Aarti Yadav, fell down during the scuffle. An 8-second video clip shared by Kanpur Dehat Police shows the UP cop grabbed by his collar by the woman who was pinned to the ground as the officer was on top of her. A villager can be seen escorting the officer away from the woman, but no where in the video it can be confirmed that the police officer hit the woman. https://t.co/R6xsHpUV4r pic.twitter.com/oktTiMghWl ""In the video, one can see the woman was holding the chowki in-charge's collar.. when the woman unclenched his collar he immediately got up and left,"" the Kanpur Dehat Superintendent of Police Keshav Chaudhary stated. The video also starts abruptly and it is not clear what happened moments before to confirm the police statement or that of the woman. However, the Kanpur Dehat SP confirmed that a probe into the allegations against the officer for misbehaving and hitting them is currently underway. ""The official has been line-attached to carry out a non-partisan investigation,"" the SP said. After reviewing the statements, videos and images, IBTimes has arrived at the conclusion that claims of abuse by the police officer based on a single picture are misleading and the video released by the police is proof of that.","

34,2021-07-17,01:09:58,society,fact-check,Fact check: No revision of electricity tariff in J&K KPDCL debunks rumours [truth here]," The J&K administration was on the receiving end of criticism over some unverified reports, accusing of steep hike in electricity tariff amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Many WhatsApp messages and local mischief-mongers are spreading fake rumours about hike in electricity tariffs in J&K. But here's the truth about it all. The claim Many people on social media and WhatsApp circulated messages that electricity tariffs have been sharply hiked in J&K, criticising the government for such a move. Adding fuel to the fire, Apni Party Senior Vice President Ghulam Hassan Mir corroborated those claims when he decided to bring up the matter of power tariff hike to the attention of Lt Governor Manoj Sinha and other officers. He stressed that the people of J&K had been suffering from a distressed economic situation and a steep hike on power tariffs is unbearable. ""Today morning, I received various reports from Gulmarg constituency wherein consumers have been dispatched with the bills showing manifold increase in their normal electricity dues. This is totally an unwarranted decision that has been taken by the power department without taking the sufferings of the people into consideration,"" Mir was quoted as saying by KNS Kashmir. Following this, the circulation of messages regarding power tariff hike in J&K gained momentum. Fact check International Business Times reviewed many claims on social media and on WhatsApp, where it is being claimed that the J&K administration has hiked the electricity tariff in the valley. After seeking clarification from the administration, it has been cleared that no such decision was taken or passed down by the administration. The KPDCL set the record straight after noticing the vitality of the messages and issued a clarification statement to debunk the rumours. It said that the consumers are being billed based on their actual consumption, contrary to claims. The Joint Electricity Regulatory Commission (JERC) of Jammu, Kashmir & Ladakh, which solely has the authority to revise consumer tariff, did not issue a notification regarding a new tariff slab nor revised tariffs as claimed by many. As some reports claimed that Kashmir DISCOM hiked the tariffs, it is further clarified that DISCOM has no such authority. ""Kashmir Power Distribution Corporation Ltd (KPDCL) today contested reports appearing in a section of Media about revision in the electricity tariff saying that no revision of tariff, whatsoever, has been carried out in Jammu & Kashmir,"" the KPDCL said in a statement. In fact, the KPDCL added that in the last four years, there haven't been any hikes in electricity tariffs in the valley. IBTimes, after reviewing the official statements, has arrived at the conclusion that reports about electricity tariffs in J&K are completely false and baseless.","

The Indian and Chinese troops engaged in a deadly skirmish along the LAC in more than five decades, which left 20 Indian soldiers and undisclosed number of Chinese troops dead. After several rounds of negotiations, the disengagement agreement was entered in February this year. However, a new report suggested that the disengagement along the LAC failed after clash between the two sides. The Claim A news article published in a leading English daily claimed that Indian Army and Chinese PLA soldiers clashed after months of disengagement in eastern Ladakh along the LAC. The article said the talks with China to resolve the border standoff have collapsed. According to the report, the Chinese army crossed the Line of Actual Control at several places. The report cited unidentified officials in the Ministry of Defence, but did not reveal when the incident took place or if there were any casualties. ""In May-June, Indian patrols in Demchok and Chumar, in southern Ladakh, reported an increased presence of PLA [Chinese People's Liberation Army] men in civilian clothes,"" the story said. ""In mid-May, without Indian provocation, the PLA began re-occupying many of the positions that had been vacated, boosting tensions and triggering counter deployments by the Indian Army."" Fact Check Soon after the report was published by the English daily, the Indian Army debunked the article saying it is ""riddled with inaccuracies and misinformation. ""It is reiterated that the news report mentioning that agreements with China have collapsed, is false and baseless. Ever since the disengagement agreement in February this year, there has been no attempt by either side to occupy the areas from where the dis-engagement had been undertaken."" The official statement by the Indian Army accused the reporter of having ""malafide intention."" The report comes on the day external affairs minister S Jaishankar is scheduled to meet his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Dushanbe to discuss de-escalation and disengagement methods in East Ladakh. The army assured that contrary to the report, both India and China are continuing the negotiations and that it is continuously monitoring by the Chinese PLA.","

Last month, Indian Embassy on Tuesday issued a detailed security advisory addressing to all of its nationals currently residing in Afghanistan, warning against the imminent threat posed by the terror groups in the region. Amid deteriorating Afghan security situation, there have been reports that India is bringing back its nationals and officials from the war-torn country. The claim Several media houses have reported that the Indian government had been mulling the decision to bring back its entire workforce in embassy and consulates. India has its embassy in Kabul along with the consulates in Kandahar and Mazar, employing over 500 staff. Since the Taliban troops have been capturing districts at an alarming rate, there were reports that India would close its embassy in Kabul and consulates since it had reportedly become untenable to operate in the war-torn country. The reports cited sources in the government, but there haven't been any official confirmation. According to reports, the Taliban captured important bridges and roads connecting Kandahar with other parts while the Afghan officials are taking steps to ensure their own safety. Fact check International Business Times reviewed the claims made by several media houses claiming that India is reportedly planning to close its embassy in Kabul and other consulates. However, the lack of an official confirmation from the government or the embassy left room for doubt. Seeing the spike in unverified reports, the Indian embassy in Afghanistan issued a clarification, debunking the reports. According to the official statement, the Indian embassy in Kabul is not closing down and the consulates in Kandahar and Mazar are open and functioning. ""Media reports on India closing its Embassy & Consulates in are incorrect. Consulates in Kandahar & Mazar are open, functioning. We DO HOWEVER continue to closely monitor the evolving security situation particularly around Kandahar & Mazar cities,"" the Indian embassy in Afghanistan tweeted. India has had a big presence in Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban in 2001. It has been helping the Afghan governments and the members of the northern alliance. India has worked towards the development of Afghanistan and even helped construct the Parliament building. Based on the official statement from the Indian embassy of Afghanistan, IBTimes has arrived at the conclusion that India is not closing down its embassy or consulates in Afghanistan.","

Due to misinformation around vaccines, there's hesitancy in people. Despite efforts to create awareness on vaccines, people are falling for baseless information being shared by the means of social media and WhatsApp groups. Yet another claim in circulation is that anaesthetics can kill vaccinated people. The claim A social media post is circulating, which claims that anaesthetics can be life-threatening for vaccinated people. Without providing any scientific backing, the message titled ""Vaccination Warning"" says vaccinated people must wait for a month to undergo surgery that require administering anaesthesia. The message claims, ""Anyone who has been vaccinated against coronavirus is prohibited from taking any type of anaesthetics or dentist's anaesthetics because this poses a great danger to the life of a vaccinated person."" While asking vaccinated people to wait for a month, it warns that undergoing surgeries within a month of vaccination can even cause death. Many people have shared this message on Facebook, Twitter as well as within WhatsApp groups, which only adds to the panic. Fact check International Business Times reviewed the claim and found no scientific evidence to support it. A government's PIB fact check team was quick enough to issue a straightforward statement, debunking the bogus claim. ""A post claiming that anaesthetics can be life-threatening for #COVID19 vaccinated people is doing the rounds on social media. This claim is #FAKE,"" the PIB fact Check said on Twitter. General anaesthesia is used to induce unconsciousness during surgery. The medical purpose of inducing anaesthesia is to prevent pain during medical procedures by numbing a specific part of the body, and its effects are short-lived. With regards to the viral claim, no vaccine manufacturer has issued any such caution or warning. In fact, health experts say vaccination should not be an impediment for urgent surgery. ""There is no scientific evidence to validate the unfounded misinformation involving Covid vaccine and anaesthetics,"" Dr Samiran Panda, head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases division at ICMR, was quoted as saying by India Today. Based on all the scientific evidence, IBTimes has arrived at the conclusion that the claim warning vaccinated people against the use of anaesthetics is misleading and baseless.","

Adding to the pile is a new claim that Covaxin, developed by Bharat Biotech, consists of calf serum. This claim has started an uproar on social media, but the government is getting ahead of it with a detailed clarification. The claim Several social media posts shared an RTI response to make claims that Covaxin contains ""newborn calf serum."" As per the claims, the serum is obtained from less than 20 days young cow calves after slaughtering them. This information has caused an uproar on social media, with netizens questioning the administration of Covaxin to vegetarians and slaughtering of cows, which is banned in many states across the country. Several netizens have fallen for the claim, some even calling for a boycott of Covaxin. Many have questioned why this information wasn't made public sooner. Fact check International Business Times reviewed the viral claim made by many users on Twitter and found it to be lacking in facts. Taking note of the viral claim, which has the potential to cause panic, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) issued a clarification in the matter, saying ""facts have been twisted and misrepresented in these posts."" The MoHFW clearly said the Covaxin vaccine does not contain newborn calf serum. In addition, clarifying on the point which was taken out of context, the health ministry said the new board calf serum is used only for the preparation and growth of vero cells. ""Different kinds of bovine and other animal serum are standard enrichment ingredients used globally for vero cell growth. Vero cells are used to establish cell lives which help in the production of vaccines,"" the statement added. These vero cells, after the growth, are washed with water and chemicals several times. This process is called buffer and it is done to make the cells free from the newborn calf serum. These cells are then infected with coronavirus for viral growth. ""The vero cells are completely destroyed in the process of viral growth. Thereafter this grown virus is also killed (inactivated) and purified. This killed virus is then used to make the final vaccine, and in the final vaccine formulation no calf serum is used. Hence, the final vaccine (COVAXIN) does not contain newborn calf serum at all and the calf serum is not an ingredient of the final vaccine product,"" the ministry said. Moreover, no animals, in this case cow calves are not slaughtered to derive blood serum. It is either taken from a live calf, which is usually the case, or in some cases imported from slaughter houses outside of India. After reviewing the facts, IBTimes has arrived at the conclusion that Covaxin does not contain newborn calf serum and animals are not killed in the process.","

There have been speculations that Jammu and Kashmir would be further divided into two operate parts, while Jammu will be given statehood. The speculations started after the arrival of 200 companies of para-military forces in Kashmir. The claim For the last few days, there have been rumours that the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir would be bifurcated into two separate parts. As per the rumours, Jammu would be given statehood along with some part of south Kashmir and Kashmir will remain a UT. These rumours have disrupted peace in the valley, with some people telling something ""big"" is happening. Many users on Twitter and other social media platforms have also added fuel to these rumours about J&K bifurcation. This has struck panic in the valley.

Pakistan even warned New Delhi against any attempt to further make demographic changes in what it calls Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) to ""perpetuate its illegal occupation."" Fact check Taking note of the ongoing speculations, J&K Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha has debunked the rumours in the latest interview. ""Only selfish people fuel rumours. Bifurcation of J&K is just a rumour, nothing else,"" Sinha was quoted as saying. J&K LG also added that he was saying this with ""full responsibility and people have understood what he means.""

It looks like there's an ally joining the Indian neighbour in those efforts. A report by Turkish news agency has sent shockwaves globally over an unverified and baseless claim about India issuing domicile certificates in Kashmir. The claim A news report by a Turkish news agency claimed ""India has issued over 3.4 million fake domiciles to change Kashmir's demography."" The report cites Zahid Hafeez Chaudhri, spokesperson for Pakistan's Foreign Ministry, who made the shocking claim among other allegations. The claim made by the PAK official is that the Indian governments issuing fake domicile certificates to non-Kashmiris in a bid to change the demography of the valley. ""India continues with its design to change the demographic structure of the occupied territory in clear violation of international law, including the 4th Geneva Convention,"" the report claimed, quoting Chaudhri. But nowhere in the report are statistics or evidence backing the bold claim, which led us to further fact check it. Fact check International Business Times came across the report by Turkish media on fake domiciles in Kashmir. The headline of the article is not only misleading, but factually incorrect. We verified some facts about issuance of domicile certificates in Kashmir with government sources and found the numbers tell a different story. The government received a total of 35,44,938 applications for domicile certificates by the end of 2020. Of these 32,31,353 were accepted and around 2 lakh applications were rejected due to the lack of prescribed documents. Interestingly, the government sources revealed that around 31 lakh certificates were issued to dependants or holders of erstwhile Permanent Residents of J&K. Based on our evidence, IBTimes observed that the report is nothing but false propaganda against the Indian government - all while using unsubstantiated, fictitious data. The domicile certificates are issued in J&K as per the laid down rules and criteria, which is not easy to circumvent or manipulate. Another government source reiterated that a total of 2,15,438 applications for domicile certificates were rejected last year as they failed to fulfill the requisite criteria for eligibility under the rules. While the majority of domicile certificates were issued to J&K residents already possessing Permanent Resident certificates, the remaining one lakh certificates were issued to West Pakistan refugees and others from Pak-occupied J&K. It appears Pakistan and Turkey are indulging in this fake news dissemination to create tension in the UT, the source added. The news site where the report was published is often described as a propaganda machine for the Turkish government, which doesn't come as a surprise. Based on the evidence reviewed, IBTimes arrives at the conclusion that the report about India issuing fake domiciles in Kashmir is entirely false.","

But there's also an uptick of false information making the rounds, letting people believe what's otherwise fake. Fuelling the fake news mill is a viral message circulating on social media and in WhatsApp groups. Claiming to be from RBI, the notice advises people to press Cancel button twice before using an ATM machine. The claim A viral image claiming to be from RBI instructs people regarding secure use of ATM machines. The image says it is important to press ""cancel"" button twice before inserting your debit card into the machine. This practice, it claims, prevents PIN theft in case anyone has set up the keypad. ""Please make it a habit and part of every transaction that you make,"" the message reads, on a backdrop of tricolour and the image also has a national emblem. Besides this, a WhatsApp message with the same instructions in text format with a headline ""Message from RBI"" to grab reader's attention. Reading this, many people are actually believing it to be true. Fact check International Business Times reviewed the claims made in the viral message and image and found them to be false. Firstly, an official RBI notice wouldn't be shared in the way the viral message has portrayed. However, if someone recreated it, it had to be available on RBI's official website. RBI's FAQs on ATMs don't have anything about pressing cancel twice before using the machine to avoid PIN theft. It rather gives the best practices to keep ATM transactions secure, which you can read below. Snopes already debunked the message earlier this month and said the claims made in it are false. Users should be wary of such claims, especially when such messages have a website link. Users mustn't click on links included in such fraudulent messages. Hence, IBTimes arrived at the conclusion that the pressing cancel button twice before using ATM machine is a baseless claim and definitely not from RBI.","

There's also a link in the message, which requires users to click on to get free internet access. When the user clicks on the link, a website opens asking for personal details like name, contact number, carrier and more. The WhatsApp message has been forwarded many times and even shared on other social media platforms, which means there are many people who might have received this and likely clicked on the link. Fact check International Business Times reviewed the viral Whatsapp forward, promising to offer free internet access for three months. At first glance, it gets clear that the message with the link is a fraud. PIB Fact Check also flagged the viral message as fake and confirmed that no such announcement had been made by the government.

After halting the administration of the herbal remedy pending a probe, the Andhra Pradesh government approved B Anandaiah's herbal concoction But that doesn't mean the remedy should be treated as a cure for COVID. For weeks, Anandaiah's herbal remedy touted as a COVID cure had been administered to thousands of people. Anandiah had become a local sensation after people in search of a cure for COVID began landing in droves at his doorsteps, after visuals of his treatment went viral on social media platforms. The medication prepared by Anandiah has been attracting people from the surrounding areas over the last few days. However, distribution of medicine was halted after the Lok Ayukta stepped in following reports that COVID norms were being violated. The Andhra Pradesh government had decided to rope in Central agencies to evaluate the ayurvedic remedy for COVID that a local practitioner claimed to have developed. With the state government's approval, there's a belief that Anandiah's herbal concoction has passed necessary tests to be used in the treatment of COVID. But that's not the case. Fact check International Business Times reviewed the claims going around concerning Anandiah's herbal concoction. The state government did approve the concoction after the Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Studies (CCRAS) declared them harmless. But that's not synonymous with the fact that they can cure COVID-19, which has claimed hundreds and thousands of lives. According to TNM, a source said that the CM sees the herbal concoction as a health supplement people can choose to consume and not a cure for the virus, which should be communicated clearly. ""The government had given a green signal only for the oral herbal concoction that was being administered by Anandaiah. He will not be allowed to administer the eye drops until the report is received from the Indian Institute of Chemical Technology and LV Prasad Eye Hospital. The reports are expected in the next three weeks,"" the official was quoted as saying. The report also cited incidents of dozens of people admitted to the hospital over complaints of eye irritation after taking Anandaiah's medicine. Based on these reports, it is advised that people treat Anandaiah's herbal concoction as a supplement rather than a cure for COVID.","

45,2021-05-31,16:54:39,society,fact-check,Fact-check: J&K police foil woman's suicide; fake narrative claims harassment," COVID-19 pandemic has posed a serious threat to the well-being of an individual, not just physically but mentally as well. As the mental toll gets heavy, people seem to take the extreme step of suicide. But one such attempted suicide by a woman was foiled by J&K police in Srinagar, shortly after a youth jumped into the river Jehlum. A video of J&K police officers rescuing the woman from dying by suicide has gone viral on social media and in WhatsApp groups, but some have shared the video with a misleading context. The claim The video shows J&K police officers carrying a woman despite her resistance. The incident happened in Srinagar, near Budshah Bridge. WhatsApp groups have been buzzing with this video, with claims that the jawans in Srinagar forcefully carried the woman against her will, hinting at police brutality in the region. The video with this context naturally drew strong criticism as the woman can be seen resisting while 2-3 male police officers lift her up after being unable to take her away. Some posts even gave it a communal spin, sparking controversy. Fact check International Business Times also reviewed the said viral video of a woman being taken away against her will by some J&K police officers. But some claims are misleading as the woman wasn't arrested by the cops. While many social media users shared the video with what exactly happened, some users used a misleading context to disrupt harmony in the valley. Taking note of the video going viral on social media and other platforms, Srinagar Police issued a clarification to put any rumours to bed. There was no communal or political angle to the incident, in fact, the police officers saved the woman's life. According to the police's official statement, the woman was attempting to jump into the river Jehlum in Srinagar from Budshah Bridge, but was restrained by the alert police officers and jawans deployed there. Due to the urgency of the situation, the officers had to act swiftly and couldn't wait for lady police officers to arrive. This video is being circulated on social media. It is clarified that the lady attempted to jump into river Jehlum from Budshah Bridge, Srinagar. She was restrained by the @JmuKmrPolice and CRPF jawans deployed there. Lady police couldn’t assist given the urgency of the situation. pic.twitter.com/A8lqD8FAq8 Based on the official statement by Srinagar Police, it is clear that the cops were merely trying to save the woman's life. Other claims linked to the viral video are false.","

46,2021-05-28,22:20:03,society,fact-check,Fact check: Brahma Kumaris not Christian missionaries; filmmaker makes false allegations," Amid COVID-19 pandemic, many spiritual leaders have come forward to host meditation sessions virtually to help the masses in the challenging times. The Brahma Kumaris have also hosted live webinars for medical professionals, who have been at the front line fighting the pandemic. Recently, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) also shared the ""Healing the Healer"" webinar for medical professionals on its social media page, to which an Indian filmmaker responded and sparked a controversy. The claim Indian filmmaker Ashoke Pandit took a dig at Dr Johnrose Austin Jayalal, the national president of the IMA, in a Twitter post, alleging that he had been involved in converting people into Christianity. Pandit also extended support to Ramdev, who has been at the centre of controversy over his remarks against allopathy treatment and doctors. He wrote: ""This is what IMA India Organisation endorses on their social media which the Dr's should question. It's President Jayalal is active in converting innocent people into Christianity. Attacking Swami Ramdev seems to be a ploy of Christian missionaries."" Pandit also shared a photo of IMA's status where it has a link to Brahma Kumaris ""Healing the Healer"" webinar for medical professionals, alleging that they are involved in converting people to Christianity. Fact check International Business Times reviewed the post by the Indian filmmaker. The allegations made by Pandit suggest Brahma Kumaris are Christian missionaries, which is in fact false. Brahma Kumaris are a spiritual movement that started in Hyderabad in 1930s which is Sanskrit for ""Daughters of Brahma."" The movement teaches a form of meditation that focuses on the identity of souls, and a way to purify minds. This may be done by sitting tranquility, then making affirmations regarding the eternal nature of the soul, the original purity of one's nature, and the nature of God. The aim of the BK meditation is also to learn to hold meditative states while being engaged in everyday life. The IMA post was talking about a session, which was hosted by Brahma Kumari Sister Shivani from May 24 to May 31 everyday for one hour between 8:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. Seeing Pandit's tweet, many netizens called out the baseless connection between Brahma Kumaris and Christianity. Based on the history of Brahma Kumaris, and no links or speculations about Chrisitan conversions by its members, IBTimes arrives at the conclusion that the claim made by Pandit are baseless.","

47,2021-05-25,22:17:27,society,fact-check,"Fact check: No, vaccinated people won't die in two years; false message in circulation"," As the world continues to reel under the weight of COVID-19, both in terms of financial and healthcare instability, getting the masses vaccinated is seemingly the only shot to bring back normalcy. But there's also hesitancy in getting inoculated as people believe fake news and false forwards. One such false information is creating panic among people yet to get the jab. Citing noted virologist and Nobel Prize winner Luc Montagnier, a WhatsApp message has been making the rounds in various groups, starting a debate on getting vaccinated or not. Here's the truth behind it. The claim A viral WhatsApp message claims Montagnier said that people who get vaccinated have no chance of survival. In a bid to add some sense of authenticity, a link to a website called lifesitenews is included. The message reads as follows: ""All Vaccinated people will die within 2 years: Nobel Prize Winner Luc Montagnier has confirmed that there is no chance of survival for people who have received any form of the vaccine. In the shocking interview, the world's top virologist stated blankly: there is no hope, and no possible treatment for those who have been vaccinated already. We must be prepared to incinerate the bodies. The scientific genius backed claims of other pre eminent virologists after studying the constituents of the vaccine. They will all die from antibody dependent enhancement. Nothing more can be said."" ""It's an enormous mistake, isn't it? A scientific error as well as a medical error. It is an unacceptable mistake. The history books will show that, because it is the vaccination that is creating the variants. Many epidemiologists know it and are ""silent"" about the problem known as ""antibody-dependent enhancement,"" Montagnier said, claims the message. Soon after the post went viral in WhatsApp groups and on social media, the anti-vaxxers' opinions are growing louder. But is it the whole truth? Let's find out. Fact check International Business Times also received the viral WhatsApp message that has been in circulation for the last couple of days. The article published by Life Site News was published on May 19 with the headline: ""Nobel Prize winner: Mass COVID vaccination an 'unacceptable mistake' that is 'creating the variants."" The article was originally sourced from US-based RAIR Foundation and Montagnier's interview was published on French website Planet 360. Based on the articles and interview, Montagnier claims the new COVID variants are a result of vaccines. But the articles only appear to be one-sided without any factual backing and other scientists' claims on vaccines. Montagnier is a known advocate of anti-vaccine community and his views are not surprising. However, the French virologist did not say ""there is no hope and no possible treatment for those who have been vaccinated already. We must be prepared to incinerate the bodies."" We also reviewed the original sources and found no mention of vaccinated people dying in two years and even Montagnier didn't say it. It is possible that the reports exaggerated on the virologist's views on ""there is no hope and no possible treatment for those who have been vaccinated already. We must be prepared to incinerate the bodies."" ADE is where antibodies generated in an immune response bind to a pathogen but don't prevent infection, and instead exacerbate the immune response. But there is no evidence suggesting that none of the Covid-19 vaccines cause an ADE response. Had it been the case, health experts and scientists would have observed it by now, FullFact.org noted. In addition, PIB Fact Check and Assam Police have debunked the viral post as fake news. There is no scientific evidence to support the claims about vaccinated people dying in two years. People should be wary of such claims and refrain from forwarding it further. Hence, IBTimes has arrived at the conclusion that the viral claim is false and baseless.","

48,2021-05-24,20:13:13,society,fact-check,"Fact-check: No, BBMP did not force COVID test on pedestrian in viral video [Truth here]"," In the last few days, Bengaluru is slowly starting to recover with fewer COVID cases, but the fight is far from over. Despite the lockdown, the need to test and treat COVID early is essential and the city's civic body BBMP has been conducting random COVID tests in different areas. But a viral video showing an altercation between youth and some officials at the BBMP COVID test booth has drawn severe backlash on Twitter. Here's what exactly happened. The claim A viral video clip showing an altercation between a youth a few workers at the BBMP COVID testing camp has been shared widely on Twitter, drawing strong backlash and criticism. The video shows two men trying to grab a youth and forcibly take him to the BBMP officials sitting at the camp. The video also shows a heated argument between the youth and the officials, which quickly escalated as the workers were seen thrashing and hitting the young man. A few passersby even try to break the assault but fail to do so. The brutal assault against the civilian by people who appeared to be authority has drawn severe backlash, demanding the BBMP commissioner to sack them. Many users who shared the video claimed the two men thrashing the youth were trying to get him tested for COVID-19. The posts also claim that the men were BBMP officials and the incident took place in Bengaluru's Nagrathpet area. Fact check International Business Times reviewed the video and the claims. While it is true that the incident did take place in Bengaluru and at one of the BBMP testing booths, the claim about the two BBMP officials thrashing the youth for refusing COVID test is not entirely true. As per our independent research, it was found that the men thrashing the young man were not BBMP officials, rather BMTC bus drivers who were on booth duty. As for what led to the altercation, it wasn't that the youth refused the COVID test. The youth was in the queue assuming it was for vaccination, but he later realised it was for COVID test. By then, the youth had gotten the OTP on his phone, but he refused to share with the officials. After extended argument, the quarrel started, which then led to the appalling behaviour demonstrated by the KSRTC drivers on booth duty. As seen in the video, the officials were not stopping every passerby and harassing them over COVID testing, which would be the case if there were assigned targets. BBMP commissioner has condemned the incident and ordered an enquiry. ""Daily, BBMP officials from Dasappa BBMP Hospital conduct Covid testing on Nagaratpete Main Road. Today, a person by name (name masked), mistook it for vaccination and registered himself. When the OTP was generated, he realised it was for Covid testing and not for vaccination and therefore refused to undergo the test. At this juncture he was assaulted by a BBMP Booth level officer by name Nagabhushan. Suo moto FIR under sections 341, 323, 504 of IPC against errant official,"" jurisdictional DCP Anuchet has said in view of the incident. IBTimes spoke to Anuchet, IPS, who was able to confirm to us that the persons hitting the pedestrian in the video were BMTC bus drivers who were on BBMP booth duty for COVID testing. Since no victims have come forward, the police registered a suo motu case, and further investigation is underway.  Anuchet, IPS, also confirmed to us that the young man had mistaken the COVID testing booth for vaccination camp and that BBMP was not forcing pedestrians to get tested for the virus.  Dr Shivakumar, Health Officer, BBMP (South), also said that officials have been warned against such behaviour and to not force anybody for testing. ""It is an unfortunate incident. We have warned our officials against such behaviour. We have directed our staff not to force anybody for the testing,"" he said. Note: There's no defending the action. It is fit for a criminal case to be booked against the erring officials. But the facts must be presented; hence the fact check.","

49,2021-05-24,15:59:59,society,fact-check,Fact check: Truth behind CT scans comparing lungs of COVID patient and vaccinated individual," Ever since COVID-19 vaccines were rolled out, there has been a sense of hesitancy in getting the jab despite encouraging proof from health experts all around the world. While there's strong evidence to support that vaccines offer protection against the deadly virus, which has wreaked havoc in the world, and those who get infected are able to cope better. In that context, several social media posts have been showing CT scans of lungs but with a misleading context. The claim Several social media users, including many verified and influential accounts on Facebook and Twitter, have shared 3D CT scans of lungs showing comparison between a COVID-infected patient and one that is vaccinated. The CT scan of the lungs on the right show severe infection while on the left shows a healthy set of lungs. Many people, including Registrar and Head International Inoculation Centre at New Delhi Municipal Council Dr Sumit K Dubey tweeted the image, encouraging everyone to get the jab. BJP Andhra state general secretary S Vishnu Vardhan Reddy, BJP Renuka Jain, among others shared the photo. Fact check International Business Times reviewed several posts with the same viral pic while encouraging people to get vaccinated. While the intention is wise, the claim made along with the viral pic is misleading. But in reality, only one of the two CT scans show lungs of a COVID-19 patient. The lungs on the left are of a healthy patient unlike the viral posts claim to be of a vaccinated person. According to AltNews, the image was first published by a Canadian news outlet in 2020, as a representation for the story titled: ""New research aims to use CT scans to better diagnose COVID-19."" In February, Dr Vin Gupta, professor at the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, tweeted the viral image and said lungs on left are normal while the one on right needs life support. He had also used this image to communicate that people should get vaccinated. Hence, we also arrive at the conclusion that the viral image of CT scans show healthy set of lungs on the left and on the right are that of a COVID-19 patient. Although the context shared with the viral image can be misleading, it doesn't mean in any way one should delay or skip getting the jab.","

50,2021-05-21,17:01:29,society,fact-check,Fact check: No microchip in COVID-19 jab; vaccine doesn't make you magnetic," Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic struck the world last year, people had been hoping for a vaccine to bring back a sense of normalcy. Now that the vaccines are here, people are hesitant to get one. While vaccine side effects are partly responsible, a sizeable chunk is deferring the jab based on some baseless reports. The claim Some unverified claims on social media and in WhatsApp groups have claimed that vaccines are being used to kill patients and another popular claim is that the governments are implanting a microchip under people's skins with the shot of vaccine. To make people believe, several videos have also stormed social media platforms, mainly Twitter and TikTok, where people are placing tiny magnets on the arm of someone who has received a COVID vaccine shot. It has become so popular that people are calling it COVID vaccine magnet challenge. Upon seeing these videos, one can easily be fooled as the magnets appear to stick to the arm where the shot was given, which is being used as a proof for microchip conspiracy. If you've come across such videos or claims about microchips, it is important to read further. Fact check International Business Times reviewed the viral videos and the claims made regarding the vaccines. Even though the videos appear convincing, there's no shred of evidence to support the conspiracy. First of all, none of the vaccines, be it from Pfizer or Bharat Biotech, contain microchips or magnetic materials for the magnets to stick to your skin after the jab. Many health experts have already debunked the claims. There are no materials used in the vaccine to turn you magnetic. The ingredients, depending on the makers, sometimes contain small quantity of micrograms of biological material, which is not harmful in any way. ""Your body is made up of exactly the same kind of biological building blocks [as the materials in the vaccine], so there is simply no way that injecting a tiny fragment of this material could have any impact. Most food is made of similar molecules, and eating food doesn't make people magnetic,"" Al Edwards, an associate professor in biomedical technology from the University of Reading, told Newsweek. All major vaccine makers, including Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Oxford/AstraZeneca have made all the vaccine ingredients publicly available. None of them have any magnetic material, let alone a chip. In addition, Pfizer spokesperson debunked the magnet challenge. ""The vaccine does not cause a magnetic response when it's injected. Pfizer is aware of the rise in anti-vax sentiment and misinformation, especially on social media platforms, with some people affected more than others during the pandemic,"" Pfizer spokesperson was quoted as saying by Newsweek. As for what's causing the magnetic effect on skin, there are a few theories. It is possible that people are using adhesive to show the magnetic effect on skin. Or similar to how a coin sticks to the forehead when there's moisture on the skin, a similar technique could be employed in the viral videos. Regardless, the evidence clearly suggests that COVID vaccines do not have microchips or any material that can turn you magnetic.","

Several are reported dead and many injured on both sides of the border - one of them is Soumya Santosh, who was killed by a Hamas airstrike last week. Mourning the loss of the Indian national, Ron Malka, Israel's ambassador to India, expressed grief while making the announcement. ""I just spoke to the family of Ms Soumya Santosh, the victim of the Hamas terrorist strike. I expressed my sorrow for their unfortunate loss and extended my condolences on behalf of the state of Israel. The whole country is mourning her loss and we are here for them,"" Malka wrote on Twitter. As the entire nation found the loss of Soumya a personal one, many expressed grief. Santhosh had left behind a 9-year-old. As many posts were shared in support of the Indian national, there was one particular image that went viral. The claim In one of the photos that went viral on social media, a fighter jet is shown with ""Soumya"" painted on its body. The viral posts claim that Israel Defence Forces named its fighter jet after the Indian national to avenge her death by conducting an airstrike on Palestine army chief's house. The post went viral on Facebook and on Twitter, with thousands of people liking and interacting with it and sharing it further. Fact check International Business Times reviewed the claim made by several social media users about Israel naming its fighter jet after the Kerala woman who was killed in Hamas airstrike. We ran a reverse image search and found a link to Quora post by Lin Xieyi, which confirmed it is a Chengdu J10, aka J-10C aircraft. Another link was sourced with the reverse image search of the said photo and it was found without ""Soumya"" painted on its side. The website claims ""J-10C is the latest member of the J-10 family, and its technical level is in the third generation of deeply improved type. It is one of the domestic single-engine fighters with the strongest air combat capability in addition to the J-20 stealth fighter."" No where except for select social media posts had the photo of the J-10C fighter jet with Soumya painted on its side. Moreover, the image dates back last year, after it was uploaded on Chinese social media platform QQ, Alt News found. That too did not have the Kerala woman's name on the side. Based on these facts, IBTimes has arrived at the conclusion that the viral photo with ""Soumya"" on side of a fighter jet is morphed and claim about Israel paying tribute to the Kerala woman who died in the Hamas airstrike is false.","

52,2021-05-11,21:23:44,society,fact-check,Fact check: Viral video of police assault is old — not from K'taka [truth here]," Due to the rising COVID cases, Karnataka, like many other states, imposed a complete lockdown in hopes to break the chain of COVID transmission. Just two days into the lockdown, several videos and photos have come to light wherein the police officers were seen using excessive force on those who violated the norms. After the direction of senior officers, a lathi-less lockdown has been ordered on grassroot level. Despite that, another video has gone viral, drawing criticism towards Karnataka state police. The claim A video is widely circulated on social media and in WhatsApp groups, wherein police officers are seen thrashing a civilian. With a voice over in Kannada, it is claimed that the video was shot in during Karnataka lockdown. The female's voice identifies herself as Padma Harish and can be heard abusing the Karnataka state police officers and even instigating the people to retaliate and attack the police. Following the circulation of the video, many people reacted strongly against the actions of the police officers. Hence, the intention of disrupting harmony was achieved to an extent, although no retaliation was reported. Fact check International Business Times reviewed the video in circulation. While the visuals in the video don't appear to be doctored, the voiceover has been superimposed on a different video. The Kannada voiceover gives the impression that the incident took place somewhere in Karnataka, but no major outlet has reported it. A Google reverse image search of a screenshot from the video with a brief description brings up an old incident dating back to April 3, 2020. Upon follow-up search, it is clear that the video in circulation is old and took place in Vasai in Mumbai, Maharashtra. Several media outlets had reported the incident last year and the video was widely circulated back then. The Karnataka State Police Fact Check team also discredited the video and said that it is ""contemplating legal action against the said person Padma Harish for causing ill will against police and instigating public to attack based on false narrative."" This gives clear indication that the allegations made against the Karnataka state police in the video are baseless. No such incident took place in Karnataka, let alone during the current lockdown. Hence, International Business Times dismiss the video as misleading.","

53,2021-05-10,21:31:30,society,fact-check,Fact check: EAM Jaishankar did not break isolation during G7; doctored video in circulation," As India participated in the recent G7 summit held in London, the Indian delegation had make virtual presence. The entire Indian delegation for the G7 summit in London was on Wednesday asked to self isolate after some of its members tested positive for COVID-19. In a tweet, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, who is heading the Indian delegation at the G7 summit in London, also revealed that he is attending the meetings virtually because he may have been exposed to the infection. Shortly after, a video showing pictures of Jaishankar with various G7 delegates went viral with the claim that the Indian foreign minister refused to quarantine and and broke isolation norms. The claim Social media went berserk after a video criticising Jaishankar on an international platform went viral. As per the video, the Indian foreign minister broke quarantine to meet United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken and British Home Secretary Preeti Patel during the G7 summit. The photos of Jaishankar meeting with the UK and US delegations were part of what appeared to be a news segment, drawing strong criticism on the actions of the minister. The allegations made in the video suggest Jaishankar broke isolation and met other foreign delegates despite members of his team tested COVID positive. The video was shared by Sikh Federation UK on Twitter and @Shenaz30. After thousands of views and RTs, the video drew a lot of flak towards EAM. The video also claims that the Indian delegation had no respect for the rules of the law and that Indian PM Narendra Modi should stay away from next month's G7 summit. Fact check International Business Times reviewed the video in circulation and found some elements that raise red flags on its authenticity. It is clearly a case of manipulated video as you can notice the Sky News logo appears at the beginning and towards the end. However, the news logo disappears when the allegations are made against the Indian foreign minister that he broke isolation to meet other delegates at the summit. Only the Sikh Federation UK's logo appears throughout the video. Also, if you listen to the audio in the video, the voice-over is different when Jaishankar's segment is played. It appears a text-to-voice software like Polly was used with a British accent to mislead viewers into thinking that it is part of the authentic news segment. The British news channel's coverage of the summit, from where the clip has been sourced, can be found on their official YouTube channel and no where it mentions Jaishankar breaking isolation to meet other delegates at G7. To further clarify, the photos of Jaishankar meeting other delegates were from May 3, and the delegation went into isolation on May 5. BOOM discredited the video as doctored after reviewing all facts. Based on these facts, IBTimes has arrived at the conclusion that the viral video alleging that Jaishankar broke isolation and met other delegates is false and doctored.","

There were rumours that the J&K government has imposed a ban on the private refilling of oxygen cylinders, which were the last resort for patients in dire need. But a clarification has followed to clear the air on the matter. The claim Social media was flooded with people's comments that the J&K government has banned the refilling of oxygen cylinders in private facilities and home facilities. With this change in process, many users also said that oxygen is only available for patients in government hospitals, which would mean a patient who can get home care in the early stages of COVID symptoms is required hospitalization in a government hospital. This also drew a lot of criticism towards the government as COVID patients facing difficulty in breathing relied on these oxygen cylinders available in private facilities and can be refilled without hassles in case of emergencies. The option to get an oxygen cylinder refilled at a private facility is what is saving patients from getting critical and requiring hospitalization in many cases. Fact check International Business Times reviewed several posts and complaints in the Valley about the ban on refilling oxygen. Clarifying the matter, the J&K Government issued a statement, saying no ban on the supply of oxygen to private hospitals or individuals is in place. In fact, the statement rubbished the rumors in circulation. ""To ensure and facilitate that Oxygen is available to patients genuinely needing it, the government has decided that refilled cylinders will be provided to them after furnishing requisite prescription from a doctor to the control room set up at Director Industries Jammu or Divisional Commissioner COVID control room Kashmir,"" the official statement read. Moreover, the decision was taken to streamline the process of oxygen refilling on the count of cracking down on hoarding of oxygen. ""The Government has also recently received inputs about black marketing and hoarding of Oxygen. There is also a need to ensure that at a time when there is rising demand for Oxygen at hospitals, there is no misuse or hoarding of Oxygen,"" the statement added. Based on the official response, IBTimes is in a position to clarify that there is no ban for any individual who requires medical oxygen during home isolation based on a medical assessment.","

55,2021-05-03,15:56:56,society,fact-check,"Fact check: Oxygen, Remdesivir data form for private hospitals fake; not from K'taka govt"," As Karnataka faces an acute shortage of both medical oxygen and Redmisivir for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, there's a spike in illegal trade of these in-demand supplies. Amidst all this, there's a new nuisance that is trying to leverage the demand for oxygen and Remdesivir. The claim A viral WhatsApp message with a link has been going viral in many groups, claiming to be from the government of Karnataka. While the message itself doesn't say anything, the link appears to be for the fulfillment of oxygen and Remdesivir. When clicked on the link, it opens an online data form, where a private hospital is required to fill in all sorts of information for ""Remdesivir and Oxygen supply chain management."" The information required in the form is hospital name, contact details, registration number of pharmacist, number of beds, including ICU, oxygen storage capacity, oxygen and Remdesivir supplier details, drug license number and more. Recipients are likely to click on the link as the thumbnail is of the Government of Karnataka, which gives the impression that it is an official order. Fact check International Business Times reviewed the viral link in circulation. There are many red flags in the data form. For starters, the Government of Karnataka thumbnail is nowhere to be found on the data form, which is the first indication that it is fake. Government orders are not circulated in the form of online data forms, rather it is done through the official website after proper notification is sent out. If you look at the web address for the data form, it gets clear that it is not from the government, rather someone random has created it for the sake of hoarding crucial hospital data. The form has been created using an online tool called Paperform. IBTimes also learned from government sources that no such form has been in circulation in Karnataka to take stock of Remdesivir and oxygen supplies in private hospitals. Based on these observations, IBTimes has arrived at the conclusion that the data form for Remdesivir and oxygen is fake and private hospitals must refrain from filling it out. This will send out crucial hospital information, which can be used maliciously if intended.","

56,2021-05-02,15:35:43,society,fact-check,Fact check: Remdesivir sold under COVIPRI brand doesn't exist [truth here]," India continues to battle the COVID crisis and demand for oxygen, hospital beds, and Remdesivir injections continues to remain a challenge - one that the government is yet to overcome. Amidst the ongoing demand, the police have busted many black-marketing rackets involving the illegal trade of Remdesivir and there have been cases of fake anti-viral drugs being sold off to consumers. Now a new issue of fake Remdesivir has mounted. The claim As Remdesivir remains in high demand in treatment of COVID-19 patients, it is being sold under the name of Covifor. But some miscreants have been able to repackage fake Remdesivirs in an identical box. Now, a new Remdesivir drug has been found to be in circulation in several parts of India under a new name called Covipri. The packaging of this new Remdesivir drug ticks off all the right boxes to appear as a legit drug at first glance. The packaging doesn't resemble Covifor, but gets a unique design, complete with a COVID-19 representation and ""Make in India"" logo at the back. The Covipri has MSRP of Rs 5,400, which is the same price as Hetero Labs pricing of Covifor. This brand name was unheard of until recently. Fact check International Business Times also reviewed Remdesivir sold under the name of Covipri. The packaging, as legit as it may seem, has many red flags. On the back of the packaging, the drug uses an address, which is partially Tamil Nadu. There are several spelling errors and grammatical mistakes on the package. For instance, the front lower part of the package reads: ""For used in India only"" and not ""For use in India only"" as seen on the original Remdesivir packages. On the back, the caution reads: ""it is a dangerous to take this preparation,"" with the unnecessary article in the phrase. Even the spelling of Manufactured is wrong on the package, which is spelled as ""manufactered."" More importantly, the manufacturer is listed as ""Pristine life sciences,"" which is not one of seven official and authorised Remdesivir manufacturers in India. IPS officer Monika Bhardwaj also clarified that Remdesivir by the name COVIPRI is fake. ""This complete racket has been busted but some injections may still be in circulation. Please do not buy from unverified sources,"" the DCP of Delhi Police Crime Branch said in a tweet. Based on these observations, IBTimes has arrived at the conclusion that the Remdesivir drug under the name of COVIPRI is fake.","

57,2021-04-29,18:21:57,society,fact-check,Fact check: Viral video claims elderly COVID patient died after doctors hit him on head [truth here]," India is struggling to cope with the deadly second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. With record high fresh cases of COVID, hospitals are overwhelmed with patients and crematoriums are have wait times of several hours. Amidst all this, horde of misinformation is causing panic and fear among citizens. One viral video showing an elderly deceased person with a head injury has sent shockwaves across Karnataka, which claims the COVID patient died after doctors hit him on the head. The claim A video has gone viral on social media and in WhatsApp groups, claiming that an elderly COVID patient died after doctors hit him on the head. The video shows blood in the kit that wrapped the body of an elderly man in his 70s, raising the question that if he died of COVID what is the reason behind the bleeding. The video, which appeared to be recorded during the cremation ceremony of the deceased, shows blood stains on the kit, mat and on the head. The voice in the video's background says: ""My father was killed by hitting on the head. See blood in this kit. If corona is the reason for death, how come blood in the head?"" Fact check International Business Times reviewed the allegations made in the video. The incident happed in Sirsi General Hospital. The hospital issued a statement, clarifying what led to the bleeding and denying any allegations that the doctors hit the elderly COVID patient in the head, which killed him. As per hospital records, the elderly person in the video is a resident of Aminalli village of Sirsi taluk, aged about 70-72 years. He was arrived at the fever clinic with 70 percent oxygen saturation level and he tested positive for COVID-19 after a Rapid Antigen Test. He was later admitted to the hospital ward for further treatment. Remdesivir & Oxygen was administered to the patient. Besides, Covid infected people are given a Heparin injection, for removing blood clots in the lungs. After getting the injection, he has gone to the toilet to urinate. At this juncture, he collapsed. The staff on duty immediately picked him up and tried to give him vitality. But, he did not survive. Accordingly, it was treated as Covid death and body handed over to the deceased family. However, there was a small wound in the head when the deceased elderly person fell down while urinating. While carrying the body in the ambulance, due to Heparin effect blood flowed from the head and there is no other reason for the same. Heparin injection lasts up to 6 hours. However, his death was not from the injury. He was already affected by Covid and succumbed to the infection in the hospital."" — Dr Gajanan Bhatt, Sirsi Pandit General Hospital's Medical officer. Karnataka state police fact check team also confirmed these facts and concluded that the allegations made in the video are baseless.","

58,2021-04-29,15:50:22,society,fact-check,"Fact check: No, two drops of lemon in nose cannot prevent COVID-19 or increase SpO2"," A new form of COVID quackery has taken over some people in India and one government school teacher had to pay the price through his life. Falling for the unproven ""lemon therapy"" to prevent COVID-19 or increase oxygen saturation levels in the body, a 43-year-old teacher from Raichur died. Basavaraj was reportedly healthy before the so-called ""lemon therapy"" as per his family, but soon after he poured lemon juice into nose, he started vomiting and died while en route to the hospital. It is not clear what prompted the Ramatnal native to pour lemon juice into his nose, but recently, a transport tycoon from Hubbali had suggested that putting two drops of lemon in the nose can significantly increase oxygen saturation levels in the body and prevent COVID-19. The claim A noted industrialist and VRL Group Chairman Vijay Sankeshwar had recently proposed ""lemon therapy"" to prevent COVID-19 and increase oxygen saturation levels in the body. Speaking to local media persons on Sunday, Sankeshwar claimed to have tested the method himself along with his family members and 200 others without giving any supporting evidence. They all used lemon therapy to boost their immune system by putting two drops of lemon juice into the nose. ""Last night two of my senior officials had reported low oxygen levels. I suggested them to use lemon and within half an hour, their oxygen levels rose from 88% to 96%,"" Sankeshwar told the reporters. Fact check International Business Times reviewed the claim about ""lemon therapy"" and found no evidence supporting its effectiveness. In fact, World Health Organisation and the United States National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine in their official websites have stated that there is no scientific evidence of lemon juice able to prevent the spread of coronavirus. ""Lemon contains Vitamin C that is essential for your health, however, there's no evidence to show that it can boost or provide strong protection to the immune system,"" the websites said. And the reference here is if a person drinks lemon juice, not put drops of it in their nose. While it's completely ridiculous to even consider pouring lemon juice into nose to keep COVID-19 at bay, there's no scientific evidence to even strongly support that drinking lemon juice or lemon water can protect you against COVID-19. ""The theory here is that the coronavirus (COVID-19) cannot live in acidic environments, so drinking or gargling with lemon juice or lemon water is thought to kill it. The idea is that by consuming lemon, you'll raise your body's pH level, which the virus cannot survive in. (pH is a scale that's used to rank the acidity of substances),"" Pediatric infectious disease specialist Frank Esper, MD said, adding that the theory is wrong. ""The study found that the virus can, indeed, survive in acidic environments. So no, gargling with or drinking lemon juice or water is not going to be useful in killing coronavirus. It's also worth mentioning that you cannot change the pH level of your body just by eating or drinking something,"" Esper further added. Based on these facts, IBTimes has arrived at the conclusion that lemon juice or lemon water doesn't prevent COVID-19. Putting lemon drops in nose definitely doesn't increase oxygen levels or protect you against COVID-19.","

59,2021-04-28,23:22:00,society,fact-check,Fact check: Intimidatory calls made to COVID relief volunteers not from Delhi Police," In a shocking revelation, several social workers and influencers who have been dedicating their time and resources to help out COVID victims are backing off in Delhi as a result of some intimidatory calls. The exact origin of these calls remains a mystery, but the callers seem to be consistently identifying themselves as Delhi Police. The claim The Quint reported that many volunteers who had been working for COVID relief in the past couple of days have taken a step back from their social work. Many volunteers alleged that they received intimidatory calls from Delhi Police, asking them to take down their posts and websites, which amplified SOS requests for COVID patients in the national capital. Sharing screenshots of some volunteers, the publication showed proof of why these volunteers were either limiting their posts with leads that could help COVID patients or stopped sharing them completely. From Telegram to WhatsApp and Discord groups, the fear of being locked up or having to face a legal battle - all for doing some good, there's sheer silence or failed responses to cries for help. ""In his speech, PM Modi assigned this task of helping people during the second wave on India's 'bal mitras'. And when we took charge, we are being threatened by Delhi Police and asked to take down the work we have done from past 10 days or so which has probably saved so many lives,"" one volunteer, on the condition of anonymity, told The Quint. Fact check International Business Times noticed a similar trend and tracked some accounts sharing similar information. Activist Saket Gokhale filed an RTI with Delhi Police, demanding an answer over the allegations made. Delhi Police responded with complete denial and said that ""vested groups spreading misinformation on social media alleging Delhi Police has prevented those engaged in amplifying resource information publicly."" In a detailed press note, Delhi Police also took strong objection to such allegations and said that it doesn't prevent good Samaritan work while opposed to those benefiting at cost of the public good.

It doesnt prevent good Samaritan work while opposed to those benefiting at cost of public good. pic.twitter.com/yqYyF32AZX In addition to that, we also noticed that the volunteers who alleged Delhi Police was obstructing COVID relief work, could not share details of the officer, his rank, or the police station as they were not provided by the caller. Based on these pieces of evidence, it is clear that it is the work of some miscreants trying to cause panic and obstruct constructive work. Delhi Police has no role to play in it.","

The benchmark Sensex index fell from over 41,000 points to around 27,000 points by early April 2020. But since April 2020, it has consistently risen to pare its sharp losses to reach the pre-pandemic levels by October 2020. And at present, the Sensex is hovering around the 58,000-point mark after falling from a 52-week high of over 62,000 points it touched before the war between Russia and Ukraine broke out. Many countries, including India, pump in stimulus packages that found their way to various markets and citizens, in turn buoying the economy. These measures supported the equity markets to touch new highs. India announced 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat' packages in several phases during the Covid-19 pandemic. Also, PLI schemes for various critical sectors too have pumped fuel to the markets. Besides, the trend of a large number of investors shifting towards the equity market in hopes of better returns as compared to other investment instruments is also likely to have supported the indices. The total number of registered investors on BSE had earlier this month reached a landmark of 10 crores. This gives an indication of the confidence of the investors. Opening of new dematerialized accounts, month-wise, on an average increased seven-fold since FY20. In FY20, the average new Demat account was at 4 lakh per month, which increased to 12 lakh in FY21. In FY22, till the month of November, it rose to around 29 lakh, which is more than seven times as against FY20, SEBI Chairman Ajay Tyagi had said. Experts believe that internet technology and mobile-based investing platforms are key enablers in the democratization of the equity market culture among the masses in India. ""The market bottomed out on March 23, 2020, and began moving northwards; most businesses were shuttered, and retail investors began to show interest in the capital market,"" said Likhita Chepa, Senior Research Analyst, CapitalVia Global Research. ""The MF industry reached almost Rs 21,000 crore in monthly SIPs, and these funds are now flowing into the Indian capital market. During the last two years, retail participation has increased phenomenally, which is the best thing that has happened since Covid,"" Chepa added. Chepa also said that following the reopening, the government launched a slew of PLI schemes for a variety of industries, assisting local manufacturers in scaling up their operations and boosting mid and small-cap stocks. According to Devarsh Vakil, Deputy Head of Retail Research, HDFC Securities: ""Liquidity is like mother's milk to a bull market. Unconventional monetary policies and various stimulus packages announced helped the market scale newer peaks. ""Many investors were looking to sort out their asset allocation plan, and due to the lockdown, they got an opportunity to open investment accounts and invest in equity markets. We believe the financialization of savings is a long-term sustainable trend, and it will continue to accentuate."" Ajit Mishra, VP-Research, Religare Broking, said: ""The markets witnessed a sharp correction in March, mainly due to the uncertainty around the severity of the Covid pandemic.

""Time optimisation does not happen on the road, and does not put any lives at risk,"" Goyal said in a statement. ""Nobody in the world has so far delivered hot and fresh food in under 10 minutes at scale, and we were eager to be the first to create this category, globally,"" he added. Zomato recently acquired Blinkit (earlier Grofers) that delivers groceries in 15-20 minutes. Zomato said that with ""accessibility (reduction of delivery time from 30 minutes average to under 10 minutes), and quality (with influence over the supply chain, we will be able to ensure highest grade ingredients and hygiene practices across the supply chain"". The company has narrowed down to eight principles to build Zomato Instant. These are: Almost as affordable as home-cooked food, Highest quality of fresh food, World class hygiene practices, Minimal use of plastic packaging, Convenient packaging for quick/easy consumption, Traceable supply chain, Delivery partner safety, and Deep collaboration with restaurant partners. ""The fulfilment of our quick delivery promise relies on a dense finishing stations' network, which is located in close proximity to high-demand customer neighbourhoods,"" said Goyal. Sophisticated dish-level demand prediction algorithms, and future-ready in-station robotics are employed to ensure that your food is sterile, fresh and hot at the time it is picked by the delivery partner, he added. ","

71,2022-03-22,12:48:44,business,markets,"US Fed will go for more aggressive rate hikes to curb inflation, says Powell; What it means for Sensex"," US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that the central bank will, if required, move ""more aggressively"" to raise federal funds rate by more than 25 basis points to curb inflation. ""The labour market is very strong, and inflation is much too high,"" Powell said in prepared remarks for the National Association for Business Economics'(NABE) annual economic policy conference in Washington D.C. US Fed rate hike has impacted Sensex and many Asian markets as FIIs usually withdraw funds from these markets to explore domestic markets. Ever since its upward revision in January, FIIs have withdrawn huge funds resulting in fall in stock prices in India. ""There is an obvious need to move expeditiously to return the stance of monetary policy to a more neutral level, and then to move to more restrictive levels if that is what is required to restore price stability,"" he said. Last week, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point to a range of 0.25 per cent to 0.5 per cent from near zero. This marked its first rate hike since 2018 and a major step in exiting from the ultra-loose monetary policy enacted at the start of the pandemic. The central bank's quarterly economic projections released last week showed that most officials expect the federal funds rate to rise to 1.9 per cent by the end of this year and to around 2.8 per cent by the end of 2023. That implies a total of seven quarter-percentage-point rate hikes this year and another three or four next year. At the NABE event, the central bank chief noted that the labour market is ""extremely tight"", significantly tighter than the very strong job market just before the Covid-19 pandemic, with nominal wages rising at the fastest pace in decades. The rise in inflation, meanwhile, has been ""much greater"" and ""more persistent"" than forecasters generally expected, Powell said, noting that inflation moved up ""sharply"" in the fall amid continued Covid-related supply disruptions and strong demand. At the time of the Fed's June 2021 meeting, every Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participant and all but one of 35 submissions in the Survey of Professional Forecasters predicted that 2021 inflation would be below 4 per cent, but inflation came in at 5.5 per cent, according to Powell. Just since the Fed's December meeting, the median FOMC projection for year-end 2022 jumped from 2.6 per cent to 4.3 per cent. Noting that the inflation outlook had deteriorated significantly this year even before the Russia-Ukraine war, the Fed chief warned that the effects of the war and the western sanctions on Russia may have significant effects on the US economy. In addition to the direct effects from higher global oil and commodity prices, the war and related events are ""likely to restrain economic activity abroad and further disrupt supply chains, which would create spillovers to the US economy"", Powell said.

74,2022-03-19,18:08:00,business,markets,War Time: Russian oil exports to India quadrupled in March as Europe shuns cargoes," Russian oil exports to India have quadrupled this month in a sign of the vast reshaping of global energy flows since Russias invasion of Ukraine, Financial Times reported. India, the world's third-largest energy consuming country, has snapped up multiple cargoes of Russian oil from traders as buyers in Europe shunned the country's vast commodities market following western sanctions on Moscow. Russia has exported 360,000 barrels a day of oil to India in March so far, nearly four times the 2021 average. The country is on track to hit 203,000 b/d for the whole month based on current shipment schedules, according to Kpler, a commodities data and analytics firm. Export data represent cargoes that have been loaded on to tankers and are enroute India, Financial Times reported. Alex Booth, head of research at Kpler, said India typically buys CPC, a blend of predominantly Kazakh and Russian crude, but the big increase in March was for Russia's flagship Urals crude, suggesting Indian buyers weighed up significant discounts against public opinion. ""Already committed oil cargoes from Russia that can't find buyers in Europe are being bought by India. Exports to India surged in March before any official announcement by New Delhi,"" he said, FT reported. On Tuesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki warned that India would be on the wrong side of history if it bought Russian oil, although she acknowledged the purchases would not violate US sanctions. Historically, Russian crude oil has constituted below 5 percent of India's total imports, which were 4.2mn b/d last year. ""Indian companies weren't sourcing much from Russia given high shipping costs,"" said Vivekanand Subbaraman, research analyst at Ambit Capital. ""This appears to be changing now."" Lars Barstad, chief executive of Frontline, a New York-listed tanker company, said that the discount on Russian Urals was about $25-30 a barrel, whereas freight rates would only add $3-4 per barrel, making the trade economic, FT reported. Frontline and other tanker companies have been avoiding trading Russian oil because of the complexity of complying with sanctions, but many oil majors and traders are legally bound under contracts to keep lifting Russian barrels. Speaking to Indian lawmakers this week, Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas Hardeep Singh Puri stressed that energy prices in India have not soared as much as they have in Europe and the US, rising only 5 per cent. India would act in the interest of local consumers within ""the margin of persuasion"", he added. Russia's deputy prime minister Alexander Novak and Puri spoke over phone last week. ""We are interested in further attracting Indian investment to the Russian oil and gas sector and expanding Russian companies' sales networks in India,"" Novak said. Indian officials have said that the central bank and government are looking at establishing a rupee-rouble trading mechanism, which would facilitate trade after western restrictions on international payments to and from Russia, Financial Times reported.  ","

81,2022-03-13,17:48:46,business,markets,"First Covid and now Ukraine, global markets reel under blow after blow [details]"," The only positive consequence of a continuing conflict in Ukraine from a market standpoint is that the longer it goes the more likely it is to temper the recently conceived inflation fighting zeal of G7 central banks, even though the war itself is adding to the inflationary pressures, says Christopher Wood, analyst at Jefferies. In his Greed and Fear commentary, Wood wrote that this political reality is already clear in the case of the ECB which is why the euro has weakened by 3 per cent against the US dollar since the Russian invasion began. Still such a change of tightening stance will take longer with the Federal Reserve given the negative impact from the war in Ukraine is so much less. It is also the case that the latest US inflation data has again reminded investors of the inflation issue. US CPI inflation rose from 7.5 per cent YoY in January to 7.9 per cent YoY in February, the highest inflation print since January 1982. While core CPI inflation rose to 6.4 per cent YoY in February, the highest level since August 1982. Motilal Oswal Institutional Securities said in a report that since the past two years, a chain of unprecedented events unfolded and disrupted the global economic equilibrium considerably. The mayhem caused by the pandemic in 2020 was followed by the Fed's decision to raise interest rates (to fight elevated inflation) and unwind ultra-easy monetary policy. While the world was grappling with these twin blows and as it was emerging from the latest wave of Covid-19 (Omicron), the Russia-Ukraine crisis has exacerbated the macro backdrop and caused commotion in global equity, bond and commodity markets with sharply elevated volatility. This catastrophic event has the potential to reset the global strategic and foreign policy equations in the years to come given the multifold direct and indirect impacts it will unleash on global supply chains, energy dynamics, trade, flows, and defense priorities in an increasingly interconnected world. The evolving positions of major world powers and imposition of devastating sanctions on Russia may hasten the trend towards self-reliance across countries. Germany has articulated the need for elevated defense spending. As far as India is concerned, the overarching macro policy theme during the pandemic was SELF-RELIANT India (Atmanirbhar Bharat). The Russia-Ukraine conflict will accelerate the same, especially in defence, in our view, the report said. At the beginning of CY22, what looked like a post-pandemic, potential demand recovery-led inflation risk is now increasingly turning into a supply shock-led inflation risk. Central banks will now have to perform the delicate yet crucial task of steering the economies through this commodity spike-driven inflationary headwind, while ensuring that demand does not fall off the cliff. Thus, in the very near term, the path of liquidity unwinding (taper) as well as interest rate hikes by the US Fed becomes a key monitorable. The Government of India and the RBI too will need to balance the growth-inflation paradox even as the fiscal math presented in the Feb'22 Union Budget comes under pressure in the ever-changing global macro backdrop, the report said. Commodity/Crude prices have skyrocketed and sent shockwaves in the system as sanctions on Russia have led to a severe disruption to the global supply chain, making it difficult for countries/companies to trade with Russia. This has practically crippled international trade especially for commodities where Russia remains a major global player. Moreover, the Ruble has depreciated by 44 per ent plus YTD leading to a contagion effect in global equity/currency/debt markets and accentuating a risk-off sentiment. Autos, Consumer Durables and Cement have been the most adversely impacted sectors due to the spike in commodity and energy prices while metals, O&G have been the direct beneficiaries. Indirect beneficiaries include export-oriented sectors (IT and Healthcare) and non-crude linked sectors, the report said. Sorbh Gupta, Fund Manager - Equity, Quantum Mutual Fund, said S&P BSE Sensex fell by -2.9 per cent on a total return basis in the month of February 2022. The broader market has underperformed the S&P BSE Sensex marginally, this month. FPI outflow intensity has increased due to geopolitical risks and February has seen a sharp surge in FPI outflows of $4.7 bn (highest since March 2020). DIIs have been net buyers for the month of February 2022 to the tune of $1.4 bn and have absorbed a lot of selling pressure from the FPIs. Gupta said the Russia-Ukraine conflict has increased inflation and supply chain challenges. Corporates will take another round of price hikes, but it will happen with the lag to ensure it does not curtail demand recovery. (With inputs from IANS)","

The United Arab Emirates had appeared to push the members of the Opec producer group to raise output, only for the UAE's energy minister to quash hopes. The oil price rose more than 5 percent, after a 17 percent fall on Wednesday. ""To suggest the oil market is confused would be an understatement,"" said analyst Stephen Innes. US President Joe Biden and other leaders have pledged to try to ease the price pressures for households. Officials from the US have been in talks with oil producers aimed at boosting supply. ""We favor production increases and will be encouraging Opec to consider higher production levels,"" Ambassador Yousuf Al Otaiba said in a statement tweeted by the UAE Embassy in Washington, BBC reported. But Energy Minister Suhail al-Mazrouei said later that the Gulf state remained committed to the existing Opec monthly output agreement, which fixes how much crude is produced by member countries. Oil prices have jumped more than 30 percent since February 24, when Russia launched a military attack against Ukraine, touching $139 a barrel at one point this week. The oil price had fallen back to about $106 a barrel at one point on Wednesday, but by Thursday morning it was trading at around $116 per barrel.","

The rise in crude oil prices comes after negotiations failed to resolve the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. The Brent-indexed crude oil prices had risen by 5 per cent to over $98 per barrel on Monday. Russia is the third largest producer of crude oil in the world. It is feared that sanctions against Russia will start to curtail global supplies and stifle growth. On last Friday, a rise in the US oil inventories along with assurance of energy supply from Russia had doused international crude oil prices. Consequently, the price on last Friday came down to $95 per barrel after the Russia-Ukraine war pushed Brent Crude Oil prices to $105 per barrel. For India, the price range is a cause of concern as it may add Rs 8 to Rs 10 in petrol and diesel selling prices, if the OMCs decide to revise the current prices. The cascading effect of higher fuel cost will trigger a general inflationary trend.

""To enable businesses to make informed decisions, a draft Presidential Decree has been prepared to introduce temporary restrictions on exiting Russian assets.

On the sectoral indices front, Nifty metal, and oil and gas were the top movers, with Nifty metal rising 5 per cent. ""Despite opening on a negative tone, domestic indices staged a strong recovery lifted by metal stocks and positive Asian markets. Metal stocks rallied on hopes that curtailing Russian exports would help Indian steelmakers to capture the export market share,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services. For fresh cues, domestic investors are keenly awaiting the release of the Q3FY22 GDP data, which is expected to be released later on Monday, Nair said.","

Earlier, Russia's central bank appealed for calm amid fears that new financial sanctions could spark a run on its banks - that is, too many people trying to withdraw money, BBC reported. In a statement, it said: ""The Bank of Russia has the necessary resources and tools to maintain financial stability and ensure the operational continuity of the financial sector."" On Saturday, Europe, the US, the UK and Canada announced that the assets of Russia's central bank will be frozen. It has reserves of around $630 bn.

Cassis told Swiss television station RTS on Sunday that ""it is very probable"" the Swiss government ""will decide to do so [freeze assets] tomorrow"", RT reported. ""But I cannot anticipate decisions not yet taken,"" he added. The president said that while Switzerland has supposedly remained committed to its policy of neutrality, ""that does not prevent us from calling a spade a spade."" Neutrality has been the main pillar of Swiss foreign policy since 1815 and the country officially remained neutral in both World War 1 and World War 2. Switzerland is obliged, however, to implement sanctions imposed by the United Nations. Switzerland previously announced on Thursday that it would sanction three Russian banks and introduce travel restrictions on 361 Russian State Duma officials. Cassis claimed that Switzerland ""did not directly adopt sanctions"" against Russia in 2014 ""for reasons of neutrality,"" but that the government had now ""sharpened its response"", RT reported. ""The EU sanctions issued yesterday are to be integrated into this ordinance in the form of anti-circumvention measures, and individual measures will be tightened, particularly in the financial sector,"" Cassis said.","

A few locations of the mobile device of Subramanian were accessed by the CBI, and found to be from nearby Subramanian's Chennai residence, a source said. ""A few electronic evidence have been found. We suspect that Subramanian used to edit the emails before sending them as the yogi. We are currently recording his statements,"" said the source. CBI sources has said that since he had access to the emails sent to the yogi, they suspect they can be the same. However, the agency did not officially confirm it. Subramanian could be the mystery baba Subramanian, who has been arrested after questioning, was sent to CBI custody till March 6 after the agency told a Delhi court that they needed custodial interrogation to confront him with seized articles and others involved in the case. A source told IANS that his statements was recorded for three consecutive days at Chennai, but was found to be ""evasive"". Subramanian, who was brought to the NSE by its then CEO and MD Ramkrishna, reportedly had access to the email ID on which the emails were sent to the ""Himalayan yogi"" with whom the classified information was shared. The source added that another team of the CBI searched the SEBI office in Mumbai, and recovered some incriminating documents, evidences and digital documents. ""These are crucial documents and evidences nailing the lies of the accused involved in the case. We are in process of making a foolproof case against all the accused. These will help the prosecution in proving our case when it will go to court,"" said the source. The CBI had on February 19 grilled erstwhile NSE director Ravi Narain, who held the post before Ramkrishna. ""Narain was asked to join the investigation. He responded to our summons. He was called to the Delhi office where he was grilled. He is also a suspect in the case,"" said the CBI source, adding that he also ""tried to evade a lot of questions"". He also requested that his LOC against him be closed. Ramkrishna was questioned by the CBI in Mumbai recently, and asked her around 50 questions, including for how long she had been sending mails to the ""yogi"", was she given any cut for sharing classified information, if yes, where she invested this money. According to sources, she tried to play victim card, claiming she didn't know a lot of things. She also had claimed that she was innocent and somebody was trying to frame her. The CBI had already opened Look Out Circular against Ramkrishna, Subramanian, and Narain, as they were deemed to be at risk of flight. It had lodged an FIR against her on the basis of the SEBI's report, accusing her of leaking classified information to the yogi who lived in the Himalayas and is still to be found. On February 17, the Income Tax Department had conducted raids at the house of Ramkrishna in Mumbai and Chennai and said that they had recovered incriminating documents. The department scanned various transactions and digital records, and also recorded the statements of a few of her employees. Recently, the SEBI had imposed a fine of Rs 3 crore on her, following the market regulator finding that allegedly shared vital inputs about the NSE with the yogi. ""Information regarding organisational structure, dividend scenario, financial results, human resource policies and related issues, response to regulator, etc., were shared by her with the yogi,"" said the source. Between 2014 and 2016 she sent emails at rigyajursama@outlook.com. Subramanian was made the Chief Strategic Advisor of NSE. He served at this post between 2013 and 2015 before being made Group Operations Officer and Advisor to the MD between 2015 and 2016, despite having no exposure to the capital market. Previously working as a mid-level manager in Balmer and Lawrie, he had seen his salary increased from Rs 15 lakh to Rs 1.68 crore annually, and then to Rs 4.21 crore. (With inputs from IANS)","

Nifty opened with a large gap down and kept falling through the day to close almost at an intra-day low. In the process, Nifty was the worst performing index in the Asian region,"" said Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research, HDFC Securities. The Indian rupee too became a casualty of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine hostilities as it weakened by over 1 per cent on Thursday. It weakened by 1.3 per cent to Rs 75.65 per USD from its Wednesday's close of Rs 74.55. ""The RBI let the rupee loose today with no big intervention and allowed it to catch up with other currencies and align with the domestic fundamentals,"" said Sajal Gupta, Head, Forex and Rates, Edelweiss Securities. ""The rupee did perform maturely this time and saw orderly depreciation on the back of $630 billion-strong reserves,"" Gupta added. Besides, the conflict is expected to impact India's domestic economy in the coming days as it has accelerated the prices of crude oil, gold and silver. At present, India is import-dependent to fulfil its crude oil needs, importing 85 per cent of its crude oil requirements. Any rise in crude oil prices will have a major impact on domestic prices of petrol and diesel. And the cascading effect of higher fuel cost will trigger a general inflationary trend. Already, India's main inflation gauge -- the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which denotes retail inflation -- crossed the target range of the Reserve Bank of India in January. The rise was blamed on high commodity costs. As per industry calculations, a 10 per cent rise in crude oil prices adds nearly about 10 basis points in CPI inflation. ""Crude prices at such higher levels will increase the retail fuel prices by around Rs 8-10 per litre and could create inflationary pressure. Although the oil marketing companies (OMCs) have not increased retail prices since November 21 last year, the same could be seen post the Assembly elections in five states,"" said Bhanu Patni, Senior Analyst, India Ratings and Research. On Thursday, the Brent-indexed crude oil price climbed to $105 a barrel after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a military operation in Ukraine. This is the first time since 2014 that crude oil prices have crossed the $100 per barrel mark. On the NYMEX WTI index, the crude oil prices surged by 5.50 per cent near the $97.22 per barrel range. ""Crude at over $100 per barrel would increase the import bill, current account deficit and thereby depreciation of the rupee vis-a-vis US dollar and lead to inflation,"" said Prashant Vasisht, Vice President and Co-head, Corporate Ratings, ICRA. ""The upstream companies would benefit from higher crude oil prices. Besides crude oil, gas prices are also expected to increase as Europe gets a large proportion of gas through pipelines passing through Ukraine,"" Vasisht added. Currently, Russia is one of the world's top producers of crude oil and any western sanctions against the country will stiffen global supply.","

Notably, the latest Index of Industrial Production (IIP) printed at 138 (index reading) in December 2021, representing a 0.4 per cent on-year growth, down from 1.3 per cent growth in November. ""While there was an improvement in the momentum i.e., sequential or on-month movement of industrial activity in December - likely reflecting some easing of raw material supply disruption - it was not very robust,"" Crisil Research said. ""Softness in both consumption and investment demand kept industrial, especially manufacturing, growth subdued."" Besides, the slowdown in on-year IIP growth to 0.4 per cent in December, from 1.3 per cent in November, reflected weaker manufacturing activity which, at 77.6 per cent, is the largest component of IIP. ""To be sure, the slowdown is also the result of a high base (as IIP had risen in December 2020 over November 2020)."" Segment wise, manufacturing IIP declined 0.1 per cent on-year in December, whereas mining and electricity grew 2.6 per cent and 2.8 per cent, respectively, containing the decline in overall IIP growth. ""The weakness in manufacturing growth was in sync with the Purchasing Manager's Index, which eased to 55.5 in December from November's 57.6. That said, strong export performance did some counter-balancing."" Furthermore, the use-based classification of IIP suggests weakness in both investment and consumption demand. However, Crisil Research, said: ""Industrial growth fell in January due to rising omicron cases. This could also have slowed demand a bit, and caused some logistical disruptions. ""Beyond that, going ahead, industrial activity is expected to gather pace for two reasons. One, raw material shortages are slowly getting addressed, and consumption and investment demand are expected to gradually pick up."" The second reason it cited was that government is expected to step up Capex, which should give a lift to the manufacturing of infrastructure-related products and services. ""That said, high commodity prices and their impact on manufacturing activity will remain the monitorables in the road ahead.""","

""The NSE is India's largest stock exchange with a combined market capitalisation of close to $4 trillion (Rs 303 lakh crore), and was guided by a BABA residing in the Himalayas. BABA was appointing KMP's (Key Managerial Personnel), fixing salary and increments of executives of the NSE. Not only this, BABA was also deciding and appointing Public Interest Directors. Operating Margin of NSE was at 70 per cent (which is abnormal),"" the Congress said. Ramkrishna was ousted from NSE in 2016 for her role in the co-location and algo trading scam and abuse of power in the appointment of COO. Addressing a press conference, Congress spokesperson Gaurav Vallabh said, ""The probe found that Ramkrishna ran NSE with impunity. No one from the senior management, board, or the promoters, which include big government institutions and banks, ever objected to her ways. Instead, Ramkrishna was given Rs 44 crore as pending dues and salary when she left NSE."" Vallabh questioned the silence of the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister on India's biggest financial scam of all time. ""Why an IP address of emails sent by BABA can't be traced till now? The entire world is laughing at us that a country known as the Tech powerhouse of the world can't trace a BABA who is sending emails from an IP Address,"" he said. The party asked who all had invested in NSE in the last 7.5 years, complete details of the holding, price of acquisition, and date of investment should be made public. The NSE is planning for an IPO and immediately after an IPO, value of investment made in the last 7.5 years will increase by 10 times. ""What was SEBI doing from 2016 on Chitra Ramakrishna shenanigans when scandalous facts were reported? When SEBI is not having any expertise on search and seizure, why the case was not transferred to the CBI, SFIO, ED and IT for investigation in the last 6 years. Who is stopping SEBI from doing the same?"" he asked.

""We will listen to our users' voices more carefully and reward them with the best quality and service so as not to repeat similar issues,"" he added.

The fintech startup aims to provide an end-to-end financial services platform for merchants. It is now established in 13 different countries. In 2022, Ashneer featured on Indian startup reality TV show Shark Tank India. He was reportedly the highest-paid shark, with a fee of Rs 10 lakh per episode. During the show, the couple got embroiled in a thick controversy. While Madhuri was fired from BharatPe on allegations of financial irregularities, Ashneer quit the company following months of controversies. It started with an audio clip where Ashneer allegedly threatened a Kotak bank employee with harm and the clip went viral. What followed was a series of allegations. From a poster boy for entrepreneurship, he ended up being the worst of the startup culture. Kotak Mahindra Group filed a case against Ashneer over the alleged abusive behaviour towards its employee. Soon after, the couple took voluntary leave of absence and BharatPe set up an internal audit. The internal probe found misappropriation of funds during her time at the fintech platform. Madhuri Jain was head of controls at BharatPe. Madhuri called her termination of services ""male chauvinistic"" behaviour. A day before a crucial BharatPe board meeting, an independent PwC 'governance review' found Ashneer guilty of financial irregularities worth several crores along with wife Madhuri. His resignation came as top investors in the fintech platform declined to buy his 8.5 per cent stake in the company. Ashneer also lost an arbitration in Singapore he had filed against the fintech platform for launching a probe against him. According to investors, Grover's valuation does not hold ground as the company is not valued at $6 billion as being projected by him. At a $2.85 billion valuation and at the current dollar-rupee exchange rate, his stake would be around Rs 1,824 crore. The Board of the company now appears in a mood not to give a single penny to Ashneer. The Ashneer-BharatPe saga continues.","

Ismail. Ismail is one of the retrenched workers whose grandfather's land was acquired by Hindustan Motors in 1968. ""About 50 people are on hunger strike on Tuesday morning and more people are joining. We began the hunger strike on Monday,"" Ismail told IANS. According to him, the strike is being held outside the PCA Automobiles India Private Ltd that rolls out Citroen cars. With nearly five months gone after the assurance given by the DMK government that their issues would be soon sorted out, the retrenched workers have decided to launch an indefinite hunger strike. Ismail said the government in October 2021 had assured them that their issues would be sorted out soon and hence they had wound up their protest then. However, nothing has happened after that and their matter has been sent to the state labour department, he said. ""It is the Tiruvallur district administration that should be involved. Sending the issue to the Labour Department is nothing but side tracking the matter,"" Ismail added. Car-maker PCA Automobiles located in Tiruvallur is a joint venture between global automotive manufacturer Stellantis Group and India's C.K. Birla group. Hindustan Motors Ltd/Hindustan Motor Finance belonged to the C.K.Birla group. The workers were earlier employed by Hindustan Motors Ltd/Hindustan Motor Finance Corporation Ltd. at its Tiruvallur car plant rolling out Japanese Mitsubishi Motors Corporation's models like Lancer, Pajero and also under contract manufacturing deal for Isuzu Motors MU 7 model. Later, about 175 permanent workers and over 150 contract workers were retrenched by Hindustan Motor Finance Corporation and the plant was transferred to PCA Automobiles. ""We were retrenched despite an agreement signed between the two joint venture partners that the workers will be absorbed by PCA Automobiles,"" Ismail said. ""Based on this Employee Transfer Agreement, Hindustan Motor Finance Corporation got permission from the Tamil Nadu government to transfer the plant and other assets to PCA Automobiles. Post transfer of assets, the workers -- permanent and on contract -- were sent out,"" E. Srinivasan, Secretary of the Hindustan Motors Land Giving Farmers Progressive Association, told IANS. According to Srinivasan, Hindustan Motors acquired about 356 acres of agricultural land in 1968 at Tiruvallur. Initially, Hindustan Motors bought the land directly from the owners. But it was not able to get the extent it wanted and sought the District Collector's help. Later, the company deposited the land cost with the government treasury and the government transferred the land to the company, Srinivasan said. At that point of time, the District Collector had assured that the land owners will be employed by the company in the Hindustan Motor's earthmoving equipment plant at Tiruvallur. ""The land cost was so low that many landowners did not make efforts to get their money from the government treasury as the expenses incurred would be higher,"" Srinivasan added. However, the landowners were not given employment as promised earlier and after protesting Hindustan Motors employed 82 persons -- mostly the grandsons of the landowners -- in the 1980s. ""After a decade of protests another batch of 82 workers were hired as trainees in 1997,"" Srinivasan said. Srinivasan and Ismail had earlier told IANS that Hindustan Motors confirmed the trainee workers only after 10 years. Hindustan Motors hived off a sizable portion of the land for its car plant to roll out Mitsubishi Motors Corporation's models like Lancer, Pajero. And some workers of the Hindustan Motors' earthmoving equipment division were transferred to the car plant. Some years later, the Indian company transferred the plant to Hindustan Finance Corporation and then to PCA Automobiles while sending out permanent and contract workers. Hindustan Motors sold its earthmoving equipment division (that made dumpers, loaders and others) to Caterpillar, US. Barring the 22 workers whose grandfathers had given their land to the factory and some others, the majority of the permanent workers had agreed to take lump sum compensation from Hindustan Motor Finance Corporation. ""The company had deposited the lump sum in our bank accounts without our consent. We wrote to the company, Tamil Nadu government and also to PCA Automobiles stressing our demand for jobs and the amount deposited would be treated as our monthly wages,"" Srinivasan had said. After the job loss, life for all the workers turned upside down. According to Srinivasan, the PCA Automobiles plant has about 190 acres of land of which about 150 acres are vacant. ""We want our land back so that we can do farming and manage our families,"" Srinivasan said. ""Our land is there. The old owner -- C.K. Birla group and new owner Stellantis Group -- are also there. The car plant is also rolling out Citroen brand cars. Only we are not there. This is not just,"" Ismail and Srinivasan said. According to Ismail, the retrenched workers have seen several District Collectors. All of them knew about the Employee Transfer Agreement signed between Hindustan Finance Corporation and PCA Automobiles and its subsequent breach. But still no solution for them.","

For example, dating-app providers must develop a new app, and submit that new app to the Apple App Store. ""ACM is of the opinion that this condition hurts dating-app providers. Dating-app providers that opt for an alternative payment system are thus forced to incur additional costs.

""Lack of management call leaves a lot to the imagination and our inexperience with the Internet sector does not help either,"" Jefferies added. ""We continue to believe that management should face tough investor questions through an earnings call rather than providing abstract details on the business,"" Jefferies added. The past two quarters signal how unpredictable this business (& probably Internet sector) is likely to be, but we remain confident on the structural India growth story, it said. After a strong 2Q, an underwhelming GOV (+1.7 per cent QoQ) in 3Q will raise questions on India opportunity, Jefferies said. Adjusted revenues were flat QoQ to Rs14.2bn in 3Q, which was 9 per cent below estimates, albeit on a strong 2Q base. While net revenues (ex-delivery charges) grew 9 per cent QoQ, customer delivery charges fell 22 per cent QoQ which was a drag. This was driven by Rs7.5/order reduction in delivery charges - management attributed this to its strategy of lowering discounts as well as foray into ~180 new cities, where they introduced a temporary free delivery. After a positive surprise in MTUs and GOV resulting in sharp upgrades in 2Q, we now cut the FY22-26 GMV by 4-9 per cent to reflect the muted performance in 3Q. While 2Q nudged us to build a faster topline at the cost of profitability, we now trim growth, but raise profitability, the report said. Monthly active users (MTU) saw a marginal decline QoQ for the first time in five quarters. Active delivery partners saw a marginal decline QoQ for the first time in five quarters. Weak GOV growth was due to reduction in delivery charges and post-covid reopening resulting in a shift towards dining out, per management, the report said. MTU saw a marginal decline QoQ for the first time in five quarters to 15.3m. 2Q base was stiff though, with 26 per cent QoQ growth. Hyperpure saw a strong 40 per cent QoQ growth in 3Q to Rs 1.6 billion.

150,2022-01-29,12:44:35,business,companies,Air India: History reveals iconic rise but fall in wrong hands [Chronology]," One act of nationalisation and one act of privatisation later, it was a homecoming for Air India, airline that returned to its original founders -- the Tatas. But it's been much more than a roller coaster ride for the aviation entity, with ups as high as the literal sky and a fall as steep as the proverbial thud. By 31st March 2020, Air India Limited was looking at accumulated losses of Rs 70,820 crore. Cut back to only 2000 and the company was still profitable. The first loss of Rs 57 crore was reported in 2001.  Fast forward to 2010-2011, the airline had turned in a loss of Rs 7,000 crore. It sure does take talent to mismanage an organisation to the point of such humungous losses compounding by the day. Aviation sector experts and economists have come up with several explanations for the collapse of Air India and they pretty much overlap. Major credit goes to bad management From being a market leader for three decades with no competitor to lagging behind with losses, liabilities, debts, decreased revenues and on the verge of defaulting on its loans. This huge turnaround for the worse couldn't have happened without bad management decisions. In December 2005, the cabinet with then aviation minister Praful Patel, gave approval to the national carrier to buy 68 aircraft from Boeing Co. The decision to suddenly inflate its order of new fleet from 28 to 68 airplanes. For this seemingly sudden decision, there was no route map for deploying those planes in place nor a revenue plan. Several political theories have been floated for this suddenly inflated order of the fleet. In his book, Not Just an Accountant, ex-CAG Vinod Rai writes that Air India's board of directors had originally placed an order for 10 Airbus (A330) aircraft. But this order was later changed to Boeing and the order size increased from 10 to 111 aircraft. Air India's policy of deploying fuel guzzling B747s on some of its domestic routes added to the operating costs and consequently to incur huge losses. In short with unwise purchases and unjustified ad spends, an airline was being forced to take on a debt of more than six times its revenues. With revenues of Rs 7,000 crore, it took on a debt of Rs 50,000 crore. The year 2007 also saw huge advertising budgets by all the airlines. This was the era when airlines advertising wasn't restricted to just new flight announcements, but all-out event-based advertising budgets. Air India, already beleaguered with debts, also allotted a maximum percentage of its expenditure on outdoor activities, like festivals, marathons, cultural activities and sponsorship of events. In the long run, that did little good. The merger that didn't help The combined company, which came into being after the merger of Air India and Indian Airlines in 2006-2007, also continued to undergo losses. In 2007, Air India's losses were to the tune of over Rs 541 crores and Indian Airlines' worth Rs 230.47 crores. Both public sector units continued after the merger without any employee layoffs. In 2009, Minister Praful Patel finally announced that Air India's borrowings rose from ₹6,550 crore in November 2007 to ₹15,241 crore in June 2009. Poor human resource management Hiring, training and retaining of employees became subject to poor and faulty human resource practices. After the merger of Air India and Indian Airlines, instead of laying off employees, the salary expenses increased. Pilots went on strike demanding fair wages. The revenue losses because of the strike also piled onto the expenses. The vicious circle of debt, decreased revenue from passengers, more competition had already set in. Untrained cabin crew and unionised employees didn't help with the image of the carrier. Many in-house members even blame the faulty and biased recruitment process as a result of which in-flight standards kept decreasing. After all, with Air India being a government company, the ultimate decision making was left to bureaucrats and government who had next to nil experience or knowledge of the industry. Bad routes vs lucrative routes Lucrative routes and direct non-stop flights are half the battle won for any international or domestic carrier. Air India seemed to have lost this battle of lucrative routes. For which, several officials in the industry, pass the buck to Praful Patel. So much so that a Tehelka report even quotes Capt Mohan Ranganathan, as saying that the airline handed over, ""flying rights on lucrative sectors in the Gulf to foreign airlines, including Etihaad Airways, Qatar Airways, Air Asian Singapore Airlines etc."" Whatever little new routes were opened up for Air India were not commercially viable. Before Air India Express finally realised this and started offering direct flights to the Middle East, it was too late. Talking of Air India Express (which started its commercial operations in 2005) the carrier's fleet configuration became more complex after it ordered 18 Boeing 737s for Air India Express. Adding these fuel-guzzling aircraft for short-haul flights added to its operation and inventory costs. The decision to finally sell it off In the March of 2018, GoI invites expression of interest from investors for buying a 76% stake in Air India, with the remaining 26 per cent to be with the government. The original offer included 100 per cent in Air India Express and 50 per cent in ground handling arm AISATS. However, with the buyer required to take on the debt of Rs 33,392 crores, it is no wonder that no bids were received for India. Will Air India truly come a full circle? In 1953 Indian government decided to nationalise Air India and it was in 2017 that the government decided to privatise Air India. Air India, the national carrier is finally sold back to Tata group reportedly for ₹18,000 crore and with an aircraft debt of ₹15,300 crore. The government keeps a sum of ₹2,750 crore in cash and also a debt of ₹61,000 crore that will be transferred to another entity. Across the world, there is no definite blue-print for running a successful airline. Often, it is about top management in great form, good economic decisions and offering customer experience. Among the top of the line international carriers, both private, public and government-owned airlines make the cut. From Singapore Airlines and Lufthansa to Etihad and Emirates are a few to name.","

152,2022-01-27,20:23:50,business,companies,Maharaja returns home; Tatas hold answers to Air India's success [details]," Air India is making a transition from public to private sector after 69 years and all the legal formalities are complete. All eyes are on multi-crore deal, more so on what the future holds for Air India, which was once the high standard of aviation industry. Years passed, the government bought the majority shares in the airlines as it was in need of a national carrier and Air India just went downhill over some big, bad decisions. Air India returns to Tata  The Centre on Thursday handed over the management control of national carrier Air India to a subsidiary of Tata Sons. With this Air India's strategic disinvestment was complete after the Centre received a consideration of Rs 2,700 crore from the 'Strategic Partner' - Talace - which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Tata Sons. Last month, the Competition Commission of India approved the acquisition of Air India, Air India Express and Air India SATS Airport Services by Talace, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Sons. The acquisition envisaged 100 per cent equity share capital of Air India and Air India Express, and 50 per cent for that of Air India SATS Airport Services by Talace. The airline, along with AIXL, is primarily engaged in the business of providing domestic and international scheduled air passenger transport service, along with air cargo transport service. Tata Sons' subsidiary Talace had emerged as the highest bidder for the national carrier under the divestment process. It had quoted an enterprise value of Rs 18,000 crore for 100 per cent equity shareholding of the Centre in Air India along with that of Air India Express and AISATS. On its part, the Centre had stipulated a reserve price of Rs 12,906 crore. The rise and fall of Air India There's rich history when it comes to Air India, even long before the carrier's name was so. Industrialist JRD Tata Group founded the airlines in 1932 and it all came from his hobby to fly planes, which started in the year 1919. It was only a matter of time before he took up on his passion and even got a license. Air India's first commercial flight was on October 15, 1932, and without passengers, but it had been carrying letters from London to Karachi. A year later, Tata Airlines, as it was called at the time, took the first flight with passengers. The name Air India was given to the airlines after the second world war, when Tata Airlines became a public limited company on June 29, 1946, under the name Air India. After Independence Day in 1947, the government of India acquired the airline's 49 percent stake. In 1953, the Indian government passed the Air Corporation Act and bought majority stake in the company, making Air India a govt-owned company. As a part of the restructure, domestic services were transferred to Indian Airlines and the international route was with Air India International Limited. Trouble started brewing. The company was profitable till 2000, and in 2001, first loss of Rs 57 crore was reported. Then in 2007, Air India was merged with Indian Airlines and the losses of both companies mounted to Rs 771 crore to fall under the same balance sheet. The airlines had to stay afloat, as the losses mounted the company continued to take loan on debt. It was only a matter of time the losses turn into mountains. Fast forward to 2010, the losses mounted and totalled to Rs 12,000 crores. One of the reasons for the mounting losses was the questionable purchase of 111 aircraft in 2005. During all this time, the competition was going aggressive in the aviation industry. Tata holds key Air India was not just an airline, but a symbol of aviation. Back in the day, Air India was a symbol of perfection. With things like five-star hotel Taj's catering service orders in flight, free food and snacks, and ashtrays. It was its attention to detail that the airlines was named the best airlines in the world in the year 1968, according to the Daily Mail survey. Air India had set the standard so high, international players would see India's flag carrier as the benchmark to match. JRD was personally invested in Air India. Sharing excerpts from JRD's blue notes, Diwan Gautam Anand writes how JRD note down his observations, both criticism and appreciations, and send across to the management. Smallest things like how some seats would recline more than the other, JRD suggested all of them be uniform at a maximum reclining angle, and how Monsoon Malabar Coffee and Darjeeling Tea was served 30,000 feet above. He would share tips on how to best make the tea and coffee. Adapting to the changing times, the iconic Maharaja logo underwent a redesign in 2015 as the brand wanted to be represented by a younger version. The future of Air India is of the matter now and who better than Tata Group, which was invested personally in its inception, to turn the tides. The company's first order of business will be to turn the airlines' losses around and into profits. Once the debt is cleared, it may go for IPO. Of the 114 aircraft fleet, Air India owns 99 and 42 are on lease. Experts are optimistic about Tata Group taking Air India to new heights. With the takeover, Tata Group is the second-largest airline in the market with a share of 25-30 percent. As a part of its revamp, Tata Group is all set to bring in some crucial changes, including a new flight app, new strategies to improve on-time performance standards, in-flight services like the choice of meals and overall passenger experience, at least on a few domestic and international flights to begin with. The road to recovery for Air India is long, but it doesn't mean it won't get there. Mostly so, not without competition. Rakesh Jhunjhunwala's Akasa is expected to start in May and has already ordered 72 Boeing 737 Max jets at $9 billion. Jet Airways is ready to bounce back and is expected to 50 aircraft in the next three years. IndiGo is still a market leader with a market share of around 50 percent as of October 2021. The aviation industry in India is touted third largest in the world, with an estimate of Rs 1.20 lakh crore. India is well on track to overtake China and US by 2030, as per IATA's estimates. The government is committed to boost the industry with a planned investment of Rs 14,000 crore in 2026 in the development of airport infrastructure.","

He could disable Sentry Mode, open the doors/windows and even start Keyless Driving. This was ""pretty dangerous, if someone is able to remotely blast music at full volume or open the windows/doors while you are on the highway"". The Germany-based security researcher that goes by the name of David Colombo, said in a tweet thread that he was able to remotely access dozens of Teslas around the world because of security bugs found in an open source logging software called 'TeslaMate'. TeslaMate is a free-to-download logging software used by car owners to connect to their vehicles and access their cars' data. This tool exposed Tesla cars directly to the Internet. ""This is not a vulnerability in Tesla's infrastructure. It's the owners' faults,"" Colombo said. ""Nevertheless I now can remotely run commands on 25+ Teslas in 13 countries without the owners' knowledge,"" he added. ""I could also query the exact location, see if a driver is present and so on. The list is pretty long,"" he mentioned. ""Even flashing the lights non-stop can potentially have some (dangerous) impact on other drivers,"" he continued. Tesla's security team later told the security researcher they were investigating the matter. The bug has now been fixed but this raises grave questions about what if such tools are hacked by state-sponsored cyber criminals. It is even possible to extract the Tesla users' API key from the exposed dashboard, allowing a hacker to retain access to Teslas without the owners' knowledge.","

159,2022-01-25,13:16:33,business,companies,Apple fined $5.6 mn per week over Dutch dating apps row," The Dutch consumer watchdog has announced to penalise Apple 5 million euros (nearly $5.6 million) per week for failing to make necessary changes in its App Store policies regarding payment systems for dating app providers. Last week, Apple made updates to its app store policies in response to an earlier order by the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) but the watchdog found it to be unsatisfactory. ""This means that Apple now has to pay ACM the first penalty payment of 5 million euros,"" it said in a statement late on Monday. ACM informed Apple that if it fails to adhere to its order, it will have to pay each week a penalty payment of 5 million euros up to a maximum of 50 million euros. Stressing that Apple must adjust its conditions for access to the Dutch App Store for dating-app providers, the Dutch antitrust authority said that in the App Store, dating-app providers must also be able to use payment systems other than Apple's payment system. ""In addition, dating-app providers must have the ability to refer to payment systems outside of the app,"" said the ACM. The first ACM order came in August 2021 and in December, the court ruled that this part of the order could be published. The Dutch watchdog said Apple has failed to satisfy the requirements on several points. ""The most important one is that Apple has failed to adjust its conditions, as a result of which dating-app providers are still unable to use other payment systems. At the moment, dating-app providers can merely express their ainterest',"" said the ACM. In addition, Apple has raised several barriers for dating-app providers to the use of third-party payment systems, it added. Apple last week said it will let dating app developers offer alternate payment options in the Netherlands, in compliance with a ruling by the Dutch regulator. The tech giant also decided to appeal against the ruling in a higher court. Apple has faced anti-trust investigations by the European Union and the US Federal Trade Commission over its app store policies. In India, the Competition Commission of India has ordered a thorough anti-trust investigation into Apple over its App Store business practises.","

The purchase of the ""Call of Duty"" maker comes as Microsoft is aggressively expanding its Game Pass subscription service to counter Sony's position in the gaming market. It would see the US firm owning popular gaming franchises including Call of Duty, Warcraft and Overwatch. The deal would be a major step for Microsoft's Xbox gaming brand in its battle against Sony's PlayStation, the report said. It also comes a year after Microsoft bought another influential gaming company, Bethesda for $7.5 billion. Buying the troubled but successful Activision would turn Microsoft into the world's third-biggest gaming company by revenue, behind China's Tencent and Sony, marking a major shift for the industry, the report said. Microsoft said the Activision-Blizzard deal would help it grow its gaming business across mobile, PC and consoles as well as providing the building blocks for the metaverse. The purchase of the Call of Duty maker comes as Microsoft is also aggressively expanding its Game Pass subscription service.

On the record date, the auto parts manufacturer will determine shareholders for the allocation of extra DWH company shares in a 1:1 entitlement ratio. After the de-merger of DWH company and merger with parent corporation, the existing listed entity will be renamed Samvardhana Motherson International Limited (SAMIL). On the 24th of January, the promoter entity and the company will unite. The IPO of Motherson Sumi Wiring India MSWIL is scheduled in mid-March, pending regulatory approvals. Why has stock price fallen?  It is to be noted that the wiring business of Motherson Sumi accounts for 17% of its total business before the de-merger. The 17% fall is a direct impact of the de-merger and the remaining 3% may be attributed to the panic selling by the investors. The de-merged amount of the stocks will be credited to the account of the shareholders once its wiring business is listed by mid-march. What are brokerages expecting? In a statement on 10th Jan Emkay said, ""At its analyst call, management re-emphasized expectations of better content per vehicle, helped by increasing EV penetration, in both the entities - DWH and SAMIL."" The stock has a Buy rating and a target price of $300. The brokerage forecasts the auto components maker to grow rapidly in the medium term, owing to expectations of a cyclical upturn in the underlying auto industry in domestic and foreign markets, as well as higher content per car due to premiumization and electrification. It further went on to add, ""In addition, the proposed restructuring exercise creates a platform for future growth through inorganic and organic routes. This restructuring exercise is a step toward the company's Vision 2025 - revenue target of $36bn with ROCE of 40%.""

According to Axios, IBM spent more than $4 billion to build Watson Health via a series of acquisitions. The business now includes health care data and analytics business Truven Health Analytics, population health company Phytel and medical imaging business Merge Healthcare. IBM first explored a sale of the division in early 2021, with Morgan Stanley leading the process, the report said. WSJ reported at the time that the unit was generating roughly $1 billion in annual revenue, but was unprofitable. Sources said it continues to lose money. The report mentioned that IBM in late 2021 engaged BofA Securities to find a buyer for Watson Health. Bids were due last week, according to one source who said IBM hopes to select the winner by month's end. IBM and BofA declined to comment, but last year IBM CEO Arvind Krishna acknowledged that sometimes the company has promised more than it has delivered. ""Watson was one of IBM's highest-profile initiatives in recent years and a big bet on the growing healthcare sector, though results disappointed in part because physicians were hesitant to adopt artificial intelligence,"" a report said last year. ""IBM is studying alternatives for the unit that could include a sale to a private-equity firm or industry player or a merger with a blank-check company,"" the report added, citing sources.","

The company said it was adjusting its policy after ""reviewing the newly released guidance"" from the CDC, which halved isolation requirements for asymptomatic people to five days.

The country's largest e-governance initiative will undergo major changes under this renewed partnership, including refreshed facilities, systems and innovative solutions. ""TCS has been playing a vital role in building a Digital India, driving transformation programs of national importance. Our partnership with MEA over the last decade has become a benchmark in public-private partnership for citizen services. We are pleased to be selected for the next phase of the Passport Seva Program and look forward to driving further innovations and improving citizen experiences using our contextual knowledge and digital technologies,"" Public Sector Business Unit Head at TCS Tej Bhatia said in a statement. The decision to pick TCS for the task comes after the successful implementation of the first phase. The Passport Seva programme, which was launched in 2008, witnessed major transformation at the hands of TCS for the delivery of passport-related services, a digitised process and setting a global benchmark in efficiency, transparency and reliability. Passport Seva programme 2.0 The next phase of the programme, according to TCS, will upgrade the existing facilities and systems while developing innovative solutions for the issuance of e-passports. The end result would enhance the end-user experience by using advanced technologies such as biometrics, AI, advanced data analytics, chatbots, auto-response, natural language processing and the cloud. While TCS will serve as the technological backbone of the programme, the government will continue to undertake all sovereign and security-related tasks while issuing passport and related services. Neither TCS nor the MEA has disclosed the financial aspects of the deal. The first phase of the programme was pegged at Rs 1,000 crore. According to an industry analyst, the renewed deal could be worth Rs 2,000 crore, Money Control reported. Besides, TCS also runs other critical e-governance projects, including Passport Seva Kendra, India Post and IRCTC. Last month, it was reported that many state governments were discussing setting up blockchain-based infrastructure for various projects and citizen services. TCS was also considered for a partnership. TCS has remained bullish on using blockchain on many fronts, including decentralised and transparent population-scale services including KYC, asset registration, fund transfers, procurement, voting system, digital currencies and data security.","

171,2022-01-04,15:18:29,business,companies,Apple's market cap briefly crosses record $3 trillion after 3 yrs gap; Doubled India business," The market cap of Apple finally crossed the $3-trillion mark (which is almost India's GDP), more than a year after surpassing the $2-trillion mark. Shortly after hitting the $3-trillion milestone late on Monday, the market cap dipped again a bit during the day. The Apple stock closed at $182.01. In order to officially designate Apple as the first publicly-traded company to have the $3-trillion valuation, the market cap must be above the $3-trillion mark when the market closes after the day's trade, reports The Verge. Apple surpassed the $1-trillion mark three years ago. The momentous growth has come owing to the success of iPhones and other products despite supply constraints. In India, Apple doubled its India market share in its fiscal year that ended on September 30, 2021, according to CEO Tim Cook. Apple estimated that supply constraints had around a $6 billion revenue dollar impact driven primarily by industry-wide silicon shortages and Covid-related manufacturing disruptions. ""Even so, we set an all-time record for Mac and quarterly records for iPhone, iPad, Wearables, Home and Accessories representing 30 per cent year-over-year growth in products,"" Cook had said during an earnings call with analysts in October. ""During fiscal 2021, we earned nearly one-third of our revenue from emerging markets and doubled our business in India and Vietnam,"" he added. The festive season's (Q4) full impact will be reflected in the next quarter and experts believe that iPhone 13 and 12 are likely to lead within the portfolio globally, including India. Apple isn't the only company in the trillion-dollar club. Amazon, Google parent company Alphabet, Microsoft, and Tesla all have market caps exceeding $1 trillion.","

174,2021-12-25,11:50:23,business,companies,Xiaomi raises concern after tax searches on Chinese firms in India," The Indian government should protect the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese firms in India, Chinese analysts urged, as New Delhi launched probe into multiple Chinese companies on tax and income issues, Global Times reported. The operations of Chinese firms remain normal at the moment, but relevant companies are looking to reassure their Indian employees as the investigation has caused some concerns, the report said. The investigation has not been concluded yet, but some Chinese experts reiterated on Thursday that the business environment in India is harsh, not only for Chinese firms, but all foreign companies, the report said. They pointed out that ""non-market factors"" in India will have large and unpredictable effects on them and cause many problems, and many Western companies have already pulled out from the country for this reason, the report added. They urged Chinese firms to be cautious in investing and doing business in India, and strictly follow the local laws and leave no excuse for the authorities to take actions against them if those companies choose to stay there. More than 20 premises in the National Capital Region (NCR), Mumbai, Rajkot and Karnataka linked to Oppo and Xiaomi were searched by the tax department on Thursday. Searches were also conducted at the offices of OnePlus, the Chinese company that has merged into Oppo but operates as a separate brand. ""India's tax laws are very complicated, and in recent years, many Indian companies and some joint venture enterprises have also been investigated over tax issues,"" said Qian Feng, director of the research department at the National Strategy Institute at Tsinghua University in Beijing. Although the latest investigation seems likely to have been mainly driven by economic reasons, the possibility of a political impact still exists, because there are extreme anti-China forces in the government, and they will look at matters related to Chinese firms in India with a discriminatory attitude, Qian said, as per the report. Lin Minwang, a professor at the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, told the Global Times that ""the investigation is not a surprise at all, because the Indian authorities, especially those in some local governments, don't care about how Chinese firms feel because they are pushing for 'decoupling with China' and they see Chinese firms as perfect targets, and they don't care how Chinese investors will look at the business environment in the country"". In a statement sent to the Global Times on Thursday, a Xiaomi spokesperson said: ""As a responsible company, we give paramount importance to ensuring that we are compliant with all Indian laws. As an invested partner in India, we are fully cooperating with the authorities to ensure they have all the required information."" Along with Chinese vendors, their contract manufacturers were also subject to searches. Foxconn said that it is looking into the matter.","

Han Jong-hee was promoted to vice chairman and CEO and will be in charge of the newly created SET division, which merged the consumer electronics and IT and mobile communications divisions, previously led by Kim Hyun-suk and Koh Dong-jin, respectively.

Kyung is a semiconductor design expert, having previously led the company's flash product and technology team. Samsung said he is expected to ""help maintain the company's semiconductor leadership and lead innovation in the components business."" Kim Ki-nam, vice chairman and head of the DS division, was named chairman of Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, reports Yonhap news agency. The tech giant said in a statement the new appointments were made ""for the next phase of the company's future growth and to strengthen its business competitiveness."" The reshuffle came as a surprise as it had been widely expected that the tech giant would keep its current division heads to ensure a stable management environment amid fierce global competition and potential risks associated with the ongoing trial of Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong over his role in controversial merger and accounting fraud allegations. Samsung's new leadership The three CEOs had been considered successful in leading the company to post stellar performances since 2018 and were endorsed to keep their posts during the annual shareholders meeting in Suwon, south of Seoul, in March. But Lee, the de facto leader of the country's biggest conglomerate, Samsung Group, has hinted at making a sizable change to the company to ""create a better Samsung."" He also warned of the ""harsh reality of the market"" amid the global supply crunch and chip shortages. The management reshuffle came a week after the company overhauled its position system and abolished the seniority-based top-down approach to nurture young talent and create a more flexible corporate culture. It scrapped mandatory years of working at certain positions, a precondition for possible promotion, and incorporated ranks to make the company structure more simplified and nimble. Lee did not get promoted to chairman of Samsung Electronics -- the crown jewel of Samsung Group. He assumed the vice chairman position in December 2012. The chairman position has been left vacant since his father, Lee Kun-hee, died in October last year.","

Last week, Vishal Garg, the CEO of a New York-based Mortgage firm called Better, chose an online call to fire around 15 per cent of his employees on a zoom call. To his bad luck, an employee recorded the video call and circulated a short clipping to call out the company in public.  Parts of the official video call that have gone viral since, show Garg on a virtual call saying, ""Second time in my career I am doing this and I do not, do not want to do this. The last time I did it, I cried. This time I hope to be stronger."" .@betterdotcom’s CEO @vishalgarg_ lays off ~900 employees right before the holidays and ahead of the company’s public market debut.The firm also got a $750 million cash infusion from its backers THIS WEEK, which include @SoftBank. pic.twitter.com/F8EfSkCRF6 ""We are laying off about 15 percent of the company for a number of reasons, market efficiency and performances and productivity,"" Garg can be heard telling his former resources adding, ""If you are on this call, you are part of the unlucky group that is being laid off. Your employment here is being terminated."" He then said employees could expect an email from HR detailing benefits and severance. The video received severe criticism from netizens as they felt the company ironically could have done 'better' in giving away the unfortunate news and also, not doing it just before the holiday season.  Shame on Vishal Garg of Better. My friends can’t speak out, but I can. Only a pathetic leader can lay off 900 employees over a 3min zoom call with no explanation or a proper farewell.This is why most startups will fail. Once the valuation frenzy fizzles out, you’ll all eat dirt. Another user questioned the CEO's apparently 'challenging decision' when the company had recently received funding of $750 million recently.  Garg also drew criticism for continuing to flash a 'we are hiring' tag on his official Linkedin page when the news of firing 900 employees initially made its way. The tag has now disappeared from his Linkedin profile. Yup over 50 jobs still posted. Looks like the CEO is the dumb dolphin here. https://t.co/O2Q2fft70w is not better by any means. An article by Fortune magazine has also stated that the Better.com CEO and founder publicly accused hundreds of staffers he laid off on Wednesday of ""stealing"" from their colleagues and customers by being unproductive. According to the Fortune report, Garg posted a series of messages seen by Fortune on an anonymous professional network days after he laid off more than 900 employees from his online mortgage company.  On Yelp, the company is known as a direct lender dedicated to providing a fast, transparent digital mortgage experience and is financially backed by SoftBank, a Japanese multinational conglomerate. However, this doesn't seem to be the only time where Garg seems to have gotten it all wrong.  A story by The Daily Beast in August this year wrote about legal allegations made against the Better co-founder and CEO, quoting a former employee: ""That's just his deal. Vishal is obsessed with power, and with perceptions of his own self in the world.""","

He then asked employees without ""critical family matters"" to work too, saying it was time for all hands on deck. ""The consequences for SpaceX, if we can't get enough reliable Raptors made, is that we then can't fly Starship, which means we then can't fly Starlink Satellite V2 (Falcon has neither the volume *nor* the mass to orbit needed for satellite V2).

RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das revealed the new function. UPI payments were previously exclusively available through mobile payment apps and USSD-based services for feature phones. However, according to deputy governor T Rabi Shankar, the latter has been proven to be inconvenient due to the lack of service on numerous cell networks. How does it work? The UPI 123PAY is designed to make it simple for feature phone users to make digital payments. The new feature is compatible with basic phones and does not require an internet connection. 123PAY is a three-step mechanism for users to begin and perform UPI transactions. Users will be able to complete transactions using their feature phones in four distinct ways: Users can utilise the 123PAY functionality to make payments, recharge FAST Tags for automobiles, pay utility bills, and check the amount of their UPI-linked account. Aside from that, a user will be able to set or update her UPI PINs with the new feature. With the goal of supporting 123PAY, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has developed a 24-hour helpline for digital payments. For questions about digital payments and issues, users can go to www.digisaathi.info or contact 14431 and 1800 891 3333 from their phones.","

183,2022-03-09,13:10:48,business,finance,Here's Why Credit Suisse has downgraded India and raised bet on China," Credit Suisse, one of the world's largest financial services firms, has lowered its India position to 'underweight' from 'overweight.' Credit Suisse described the downgrade as 'tactical,' adding that the funds freed up from India will be used to boost its China and Australia positions to 'overweight' from 'market weight.' The reason attributed by Credit Suisse for downgrading India is the steep jump in the global oil prices due to the Ukrainian War. Credit Suisse highlighted, ""Because of its strong structural prospects and robust earnings per share momentum, we will look for opportunities to re-enter the market, but today we tactically cut our India position. Higher oil prices hurt the current account, add to inflationary pressures and increase sensitivity to Fed rate hikes."" Raising bet on China, the report said, ""We use the funds freed from India to raise China from Market Weight to Overweight. China's credit intensity still clouds long-term prospects but we like the country's low oil import bill, insulation from Fed rate hikes, improving macro indicators and wealth of potential policy tools."" It is pertinent to note that Benchmark Brent crude prices for May increased $3.07, or 2.49 per cent, to $126.28 a barrel, while WTI crude futures for April delivery jumped $2.29, or 1.92 per cent, to 121.69 a barrel. Russia is the world's second-largest oil exporter, exporting over 7 million barrels of crude and petroleum products per day. 'Oil prices may jump further' Moreover, Russia has warned that if the West stops importing oil, oil prices may rise to $300 per barrel, and it may shut off the main gas pipeline to Germany. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine on February 24, the United States, the world's largest oil user, has taken unilateral action to prohibit Russian oil imports. Since February 24, when Russia began a special military offensive in Ukraine, India's benchmark indices have lost over 6%. The battle, which is being viewed as a full-fledged war, has resulted in penalties on Russia, with rumours suggesting that some countries may impose an embargo on Russian oil imports.","

Sberbank, Russia's largest bank, as well as Alfa Bank and Tinkoff, all announced the transfer to UnionPay on Sunday. The development has come amidst, Visa and Mastercard, both based in the United States, announced on Saturday that they were halting operations in Russia as a result of the invasion of Ukraine and that they would work with clients and partners to stop all transactions there. All transactions started with Visa cards issued in Russia will no longer function outside of the nation within days and any Visa cards issued outside of Russia will no longer work within the country, the company said in an official statement. It is pertinent to note that Russian banks have been barred from using the SWIFT global payments system by the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union. SWIFT connects nearly 11,000 banks and institutions in over 200 countries, and Russia's loss of access to the system would have an impact on international cash transfers and foreign trade. Multiple Russian financial firms have also been barred from utilising Mastercard and Visa's networks. Russians are bracing for an uncertain future of escalating inflation, economic misery, and an even tighter squeeze on imported products as a result of the payments firms' move. Unprecedented Western sanctions against Russia have frozen a large portion of the country's central bank's $640 billion in assets, prevented many banks from using the global payments system SWIFT, and put the rouble into free decline, wiping off a third of its value this week. Russia's greater adoption of Mir After the imposition of international sanctions in 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea, Russia has been aiming to minimize its dependency on Western payment networks. While Russians are increasingly adopting and using Mir cards, they still lag behind international competitors such as Visa and Mastercard.","

185,2022-02-21,17:59:58,business,finance,How does CIBIL score impact your loan eligibility?," CIBIL Score and Loan Eligibility: Overview In today's fast-paced world, people grapple with unpredictable situations economic turmoil, national crises, volatility in the financial markets, stock market crashes, pandemic, job losses, and more. At times such as these, you can find yourself financially strapped despite your best effort. Even when all is well with the world around, personal issues, such as a medical emergency or an unavoidable big-ticket expense, can arise out of the blue. There can also be a situation wherein, despite the lack of urgency, you fall short of funds for planned expenditure. Now, across all three scenarios, the best recourse would be to avail of a credit facility such as a personal loan, business loan, and more. Now irrespective of the type of loan, the approval depends primarily on your CIBIL score. To put it simply, the CIBIL score reflects your creditworthiness and can help you easily receive a loan of your choice. Conversely, if your CIBIL score is not in the optimum range, you face the prospect of loan rejection or getting one at expensive interest rates. Therefore, before you apply for a loan, it is imperative that you check your CIBIL score. Understanding the CIBIL Score In the country, credit information companies, such as TransUnion Credit Information Bureau (India) Ltd (CIBIL), generate the three-digit credit score for individuals. The credit score generated by TransUnion CIBIL is popularly known as the CIBIL score. Numerically, the score can range from a minimum of 300 to a maximum of 900. Across financial institutions, an excellent CIBIL score is one that is above 750. A CIBIL score of 750 and above can convince the lending institution about your repayment capacity and overall creditworthiness. According to a report published in the New Indian Express on April 30, 2021., 90% of loans approved tend to be of those borrowers who have a CIBIL score of 750 or above. Variables Involved in CIBIL Score Calculation Before you check your credit score, you must know the factors affecting it. This score is directly dependent upon your past financial behavior. The variables involved in the calculation of the CIBIL score are: .... Reasons Why Financial Institutions Check the CIBIL Score Your CIBIL score and loan eligibility are closely intertwined. A financial institution will check your CIBIL score for the following reasons: To Understand Your Credit Repayment Pattern: Using the CIBIL score, a lending institution can know your past patterns regarding credit repayments. If you have repeatedly defaulted on your EMI obligations in the past, it does not reflect well on your creditworthiness. To Know Your Repayment Capacity: Any lending institution must differentiate between high-risk and low-risk borrowers. A good CIBIL score indicates a low-risk borrower who has the capacity and financial discipline to repay the loan. To Calculate the Interest Rate and Loan Amount: Once the lending institution knows your CIBIL score, it will then use it to calculate the interest rate and determine the actual amount of loan to be disbursed. Individuals with a good CIBIL score can expect reasonable rates of interest along with disbursal of the required loan amount. Want to Check Your CIBIL Score Instantly? To instantly check the CIBIL score online, you can visit the official CIBIL website. To access your complete CIBIL report, however, you have to take a subscription for 1 month, 6 months or 12 months, and pay the requisite fees. Wondering how to check the CIBIL score sans any charges? For a free CIBIL score check and credit report, you can visit a loan aggregator platform. Here, you also receive free financial health reports detailing your credit history and a summary of your accounts. These reports can also guide you to improve your score. Does A Low CIBIL Score Mean End of the Road for Borrowers? A good CIBIL score is a prerequisite for loan approval. However, if a CIBIL score check reveals low figures, it does not mean that you have exhausted all your chances of securing credit at affordable rates. You can take some requisite steps to enhance your score over time. Here is a look at how: Is a Good Credit Score Sufficient for Loan Approval? Though the relationship between CIBIL score and loan eligibility is intrinsic and can help you receive an unsecured loan at affordable rates, it is not the sole eligibility criteria. So along with checking the CIBIL score, make sure that you fulfill the other eligibility conditions as well. These include criteria around income, age, place of residence, work experience, and so on. It can be safely said that the CIBIL score is of utmost importance among the various loan eligibility conditions. But if you fail to fulfill the other stipulated conditions, such as those for income and age, your loan cannot be approved. The Final Word To sum up, you must check the CIBIL score before making a credit application. A good CIBIL score can allow you to negotiate and get the best deal – including an affordable interest rate, desired loan amount, and preferred repayment tenor – from a lending institution across different loan types. A good CIBIL score underscores your financial commitment to repay your dues. However, a score less than the optimum does not spell complete disaster. To build up a damaged CIBIL score, you can still take concerted steps to improve the score gradually and qualify yourself for loans.","

The applicant received the work order to execute the contract at Karwar in Karnataka. The supply here is in the nature of composite supply of goods and services involving supply, erection, and installation of steel after fabrication used for harboring/anchoring of ships and classified as service. The applicant sought the advance ruling on the issue of whether the company is required to be registered in the state of Karnataka for executing the works contract. Ease of business The KAAR ruled that the applicant need not obtain separate registration in Karnataka, for the supply of services and can raise the invoice by charging IGST from their registered office at Noida, Uttar Pradesh, with the place of supply as Karnataka. The authority said that the applicants are neither having nor intending to have any establishment at the site at Karwar, Karnataka, so they cannot obtain ISD registration for the site at which they are delivering service.

190,2021-10-28,08:51:00,business,finance,"India's coal situation no longer a crisis: CIL allays fears, worries; says no need to panic [Exclusive]"," Lately, India's coal situation has led to a national conversation on whether it's just a temporary shortage or a real crisis staring in the eye. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman though, had reportedly put an end to the discussions even before they began, by calling all the energy worries, ""as absolutely baseless."" Meanwhile, the former and current bureaucrats in the power ministry brainstorm over how did the nation end up with just about four days of coal reserves left? In a recent interview to The Wire, Anil Swarup, former coal secretary of India, looks back at a time when India was contemplating exporting surplus coal to Bangladesh. Which was not long ago in 2016, when the nation had ample coal stock worth Rs 35,000 crore. Regardless of which political ideology one subscribes to, there's a growing ruckus over one collective question; What went wrong and who is responsible? ""We are certainly short of coal,"" he minces no words before breaking down the current situation into two aspects. ""There is demand side management and then there is supply side management. Covid economy is recovering, hence there is a demand for power and this has also led to rise in coal prices. These are aspects over which we have no control as demand will go up and down. However, what we have control over is the supply side management."" Which boils down to two sources; Coal India Limited (CIL) which supplies 80 per cent of the coal required in India and the private sector which provides the remaining 20 per cent. The demand has surged and how As per one of the reported estimates, recently over 28 million households have got new connection. Mostly being the lower and middle class income that have bought new TV sets, lights, refrigerator, etc. Add to it, the extended monsoon rains, flooded mines and disrupted transport. When International Business Times got in touch with Coal India Limited, its spokesperson K. Sunil Kumar, firstly explains the ""combination of many factors that led to the four-day stock situation."" He says, ""Primary reason was power generation spiralling up to record levels to match the increased demand for power. Added to that, excessive and extended monsoon impinged upon CIL's production and despatches. Imported coal-based power plants curtailing their generation due to high international coal prices had shifted the demand burden to domestic coal-based generators, thereby exacerbating the situation. In turn, CIL had to meet this coal demand to the tune of 15 MTs which was not factored in its annual plan. Inadequate coal-stock build-up by thermal power plants at an appropriate time, earlier in the year, was another crucial factor."" As for CIL's manpower being deployed for other projects of the Centre, he says, ""While it would be bad form to comment on the views expressed by the individual, the fact is that during 2015-16 some of the CIL's manpower was actively engaged in Swachh Bharat mission, but not to the detriment of its core operations. And that is now in the past."" Private sector problems When a country is looking at zero coal stocks, even 20 per cent becomes a significant figure. 20 per cent of the coal comes from the private sector, the problem which began with, as Swarup says, ""With the rampage in CAG in 2014 who ensured that more than 200 blocks of allocation were cancelled. There were 90 million tonnes of coal being produced by the private sector at that point in time and it all stopped."" A situation that necessitated the reviving of the new coal blocks, but for unrealistic bidding because of which many companies failed to function. The final nail in the coffin was the war between states and the Centre, which meant a lack of clearances. He adds, ""Commercial mining should have started in 2015, this file was not sent to them and this decision was taken only after 5 years."" As for the CIL's financial prudence being questioned and the investment in fertilisers, Kumar calls the organisation's financial fundamentals very strong. ""CIL is almost a debt-free company. Much of coal mining and evacuation projects are met through their own funds. The company's Board determines the dividend payment to all its shareholders including the Government of India. It would be incorrect to state that CIL's expansion plans are hit by a lack of funds. At the closure of last financial CIL had in excess of Rs. 17,200 crores cash and bank balance after adjusting the short-term borrowings. An investment to the tune of Rs 10,500 crores in CIL's 35 first mile connectivity projects is funded internally."" The way out  Many think tanks from the power industry have tossed immediate solutions for the problem. The most apparent and short term fix is borrowing from the private coal mines where surplus is available, which can be later replenished by CIL. He calls the situation, no longer a crisis. ""In the initial stages itself, when the demand far outstripped the rate of supply, CIL embarked upon a multi-pronged approach to shore up the stocks at power plants. These include offering coal on 'as-is-where' basis through rail-cum-road mode from sources where the high stock was available. 23 such mines carrying 40.3 MTs of stock as of 16 August were identified. Supply to the power plants carrying stock of zero to six days was prioritized by preparing a contingency supply plan to increase their stock. In case of availability issue at linked mines, alternative sources have already been allocated for seamless running of power plants."" He adds, ""Currently, despatches to the power sector are going up steadily with around 21 Lakh tonnes of coal per day being pumped in from CIL and other sources. Whereas the consumption of the powerhouses is hovering around 17 to 18 Lakh tonnes of coal per day. This means around 3 lakhs tonnes per day is adding up to the stock at power plants on daily basis. So there is no need to press the panic button or be worried.""","

But before that, a flash crash in Bitcoin's price triggered panic among the traders. Bitcoin price, from its all-time high, plunged nearly 90 percent to $8,200 from around $65,000 on US trading platform Binance on Thursday morning. The crypto's price remained unaffected on other trading platforms, while Binance attributed the flash crash to a bug in the trading algorithm. ""We are continuing to look into the event, but understand from the trader that they have now fixed their bug and that the issue appears to have been resolved,"" a spokesperson was quoted as saying. The snafu was resolved in a matter in a jiffy, but Binance traders who noticed the sudden drop couldn't comprehend it. Binance said the Bitcoin flash crash was a result of an institutional trader's rogue algorithm, which caused the sell-off. Incidentally, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao had warned of crypto traders of high volatility in the coming months and the Bitcoin flash crash coincided Changpeng's tweet. Bitcoin may touch $100K According to Nigel Green, CEO and founder of deVere Group which has $12 billion under management, Bitcoin is undeniably a mainstream asset class and most investors should consider including crypto assets as part of a diversified portfolio. The Bitcoin market cap has touched $2.5 trillion amid its rising adoption globally, particularly in India. The Indian cryptocurrency market is expected to reach up to $241 million by 2030 in India and $2.3 billion by 2026 worldwide.

192,2021-09-18,12:59:12,business,finance,What is Bad Bank? How will it help Indian financial system (Explainer)," Earlier this week, Finance Minister announced the formation of National Asset Reconstruction Company Limited (NARCL). The announcement was a part of the Union Budget that was presented in February this year.  This company will buy stressed assets totaling Rs 2 lakh crore from a number of commercial banks in stages. The stressed assets would then be sold in the market by another business, India Debt Resolution Company Ltd (IDRCL), which has also been established. This structure of NARCL-IDRCL is known as 'Bad Bank'. Moreover, the central government has also approved Rs 30,600 crore as a guarantee. A 'Bad Bank' is a business structure that separates banks' riskier assets into a separate organization. It is created with the goal of purchasing non-performing assets (NPAs) from a bank at a price specified by the bad bank. What is the need for a 'Bad Bank'? Non-performing assets (NPAs) or bad loans of banks have declined stood at Rs 8.34 lakh crore at the end of March 31, 2021. When the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) started a strict scrutinizing of the books of banks the bad loans started rising at an alarming rate. It rose to its highest level in 2016.  These high NPAs in the financial sector were affecting the flow of liquidity in the market hence growth. In order to find out the bad loans and giving them to a dedicated company, the idea of a bad bank was mooted in the Economic Survey of 2016.  Function of the Bad Bank In the first step, NARCL will purchase bad loans from the bank after which it would pay 15% of the agreed price in cash. The 85% of the remaining amount will be in form of 'Security Receipts'. Further, when the assets are sold in the market the commercial banks will be paid back the amount. In case, the bad bank is unable to sell the bad loan or sells at a loss, the government guarantee will be invoked. ","

193,2021-07-23,14:55:41,business,finance,Top 5 reasons why you should buy a term insurance policy," In this fast-paced world, we often find ourselves dealing with day-to-day struggles that completely consume us. And then sometimes things come as a shock that we completely forget to prepare ourselves for. It can come in the form of an accident, a health condition, or even a pandemic. While one should take all precautions to avoid such an outcome, it is always prudent to be prepared for such a reality. This becomes especially true in a world where millions of people have died of a deadly virus whose existence we did not even know about until last year [1]. But a pandemic is not the only reason to have a backup plan for your family's protection. We live in a world with rising uncertainties and an increasing prevalence of life-threatening disorders. As per the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), there are expected to be over 17 lakh new cases of cancer every year. Out of those, around half are expected to survive with proper treatment. The cases of heart diseases are also rising in the country and its prevalence, along with stroke, has increased by over 50 percent over the last three decades. [2] Amid such a reality, every family needs a life cover that could allow them to deal with losing a loved one, at least financially. To make sure your family is secure, you may opt for a term insurance policy as it will help you prepare for such uncertainties that are increasing day by day. Term insurance is the most simple form of all life insurance policies that provide death benefits if the insured dies during the policy period. If you want to secure your family's future, a term insurance policy is an instrument that can help you achieve that. Here are the top 5 reasons why you should buy a term insurance policy today : Financial Stability: The biggest concern that leaves most people sleepless is "" What's going to happen to my family once I am gone?"" A term insurance plan takes care of this concern by ensuring that there is a lumpsum or a constant stream of cash flow, even in the absence of the policyholder. That means your family does not have to compromise with their lifestyle. The pay-out they receive in case of your untimely demise can be utilized for monthly expenses or critical life goals, such as the education of children, old-age care for parents or spouse, or even repaying major liabilities like a home loan. Low Premium: The premium amount of term plans are more affordable. The premiums are even lower when you are young as the risks involved are less. For example, you can get a life cover of Rs 1 crore at a premium starting at Rs 21 per day [3] if you go with the Bajaj Allianz Life Smart Protect Goal - A Non-Linked, Non-Participating in,  Pure Life Term Insurance Plan. Moreover, term insurance premiums can be paid monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, or yearly basis, depending on the product terms and conditions. This flexibility allows you to afford a significant life cover to cover all future needs of your family in case you are not there to take care of them. It is advisable to buy a term insurance policy at a young age to gain from lower premiums and stay protected for a longer-term. Highly flexible: Flexibility is one of the most significant advantages of a term plan. This flexibility is available not only in terms of paying premiums but also in terms of the pay-out that your family would receive in case of a claim. As mentioned before, you can pay the premium of your policy on a monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, or annual basis. Moreover, you can decide whether your family receives a lump-sum payment, a monthly income, a mix of lump-sum and income, or even an increasing income that grows with time as per the policy terms and conditions. You can choose a monthly pay-out option if you feel your family would not be able to manage a huge sum at one go, and that their needs would be better served if they receive the money as per their monthly requirements. And if your family is well aware of how to handle finances, you can choose a lump-sum payment option. Riders: When you buy a term life insurance policy, you can also choose some extra benefits on top of the base policy at a nominal extra cost. These extra benefits are called ""riders"" or ""add-ons"". Riders are the additional benefits that come with term insurance plans as per the requirement of the policyholder. For example, the Bajaj Allianz Life Smart Protect Goal - A Non-Linked, Non-Participating, Pure Life Term Insurance Plan offers several riders, which enhance the plan's coverage at a nominal cost. Some common term insurance riders are Critical Illness Benefit (CIB), Accidental Death Benefit (ADB), Waiver of Premium Benefit[4] (WIPB), etc. A critical illness add-on would pay out a lump-sum amount if you get diagnosed with any of the 55 listed critical illnesses in the policy document[5]. One the other hand, a disability rider does the same if you are left totally or partially disabled due to an accident as per the terms of the rider. In case of a waiver of premium rider, all future premium payments are waived in case of occurrence of any covered event. Meanwhile, the policy continues uninterrupted until the end of the policy term. Tax savings: Even though the main purpose of buying a term insurance plan is to protect the financial future of your family, the added bonus is that such plans come with substantial tax benefits. Not only do you get tax deduction on the premium payments every year, the claim amount paid to your family would also be completely tax-free. The premium paid for term insurance plans is eligible for a tax deduction of up to Rs 1.5 lakh in a year under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Additionally, the pay-out to the nominees on the death of the policyholder is also tax-exempt under Section 10 (10D) of the Income Tax Act. These term insurance tax benefits are subject to the provisions mentioned in Incometax Act 1961. Bajaj Allianz Life insurance has a claim settlement ratio of 98.48%~ percent. The above-mentioned Bajaj Allianz Life Smart Protect Goal - A Non-Linked, Non-Participating, Pure Life Term Insurance Plan also offers a child education cover [5] which offers extra protection of up to 100% of base cover for a child's education expenses in case of the policyholder's death during the specified period. With all these benefits that you get by choosing a term insurance plan, it is a no-brainer that it is among one of the preferred options available to secure your family's future. If you do not have a term insurance plan already, get one today completely online from Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance's website.

194,2021-07-16,00:47:02,business,finance,"Two-year-old Mithraa needs ₹16 crore drug to live; Govt waives off customs, GST [details]"," This is not for the first time that an Indian child has been in urgent need of a lifesaving drug that costs Rs16 crore per dose and has to be imported from the US. Often against the price tag of the drug, the impossible task of raising the impossible amount takes over. The issue of hefty taxes that the drug has always been subject to, remains buried in the background. The Union Government recently waived the GST and import duty to import Zolgensma, labelled as the most expensive drug in the world, for baby Mithraa. Mithraa was diagnosed with Spinal Muscular Atrophy on June 4 and since the drug has to be administered to a child under two-years of age, her parents had until July 5 to raise the money, get the waiver and administer the dose. After the parents somehow managed the Herculean task of raising Rs 16 crore, the GST of 5 per cent stood in the way, for which they needed a waiver. Even though the customs duty for life-saving drug has been waived, but ample amount of paperwork goes behind the waiver. On Wednesday, finally, after amplified requests on social media, including requests from Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin and Coimbatore MLA Vanathi Srinivasan, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman waived the import duty and GST under exceptional circumstances and in the public interest. Why the waiver needs to be permanent?  Local BJP MLAs and party workers and several others have viewed the development as job done, but that's not nearly enough. Many of those with NGOs associated with crowdfunding say that the waiver on customs duty, GST not just needs to be made permanent but further the drug needs to be heavily subsidized. Starting with the price itself that hardly anyone can afford, of the handful of cases reported in the country each year. Urging on the need for subsidy against the number of cases reported, Chief Minister MK Stalin wrote in the letter addressed to Finance Minister Sitharaman, ""Drugs for this gene-therapy are being imported by the hospitals for treatment in Tamil Nadu and annually 90-100 such cases are being reported. As these drugs are imported, the customs duty and integrated GST levied on them, increase the cost of gene therapy."" MLA Srinavasan, wrote to PM Modi and requested the same. She also mentioned how the parents of Mithraa, Sathish and Priyadharshini had resorted to crowdfunding to save their daughter's life and hence if the government could chip in by waiving the import duty and GST on the lifesaving medicine. The total GST, taxes and import duty amount to 35 percent of the cost of the medicine. Dr SK Singla, neonatologist, Chandigarh Hospital, says there have been quite a few cases and there has definitely been a surge of similar cases on crowdfunding platforms. ""The finance ministry gives a waiver on case-by-case basis, which is not nearly enough. The drug needs to be subsidised and there needs to be blanket exemption from duties. Because then that's one burden less for the parents on a timer and fighting for their child's life."" The Rs 16 crore drug At a reported price of $2.125 million per dose, Zolgensma is by far the most expensive drug in the world. Zolgensma (onasemnogene abeparvovec) is currently a part of drugmaker Novartis' portfolio. Originally biotechnology company Avexis (which develops treatments for rare neurological genetic disorders) had developed the drug. It is the first gene replacement therapy for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy in pediatric patients. The drugmaker Novartis Gene Therapy has revealed that in studies, Zolgensma has helped babies reach milestones such as breathe without the help of a ventilator, sit up, crawl and even walk after a single infusion treatment. Earlier this year, it was also approved by the NHS (National Health Service) England to treat pediatric patients, less than 2 years of age who suffer from the rare genetic disease of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). What is the drug required for?  A rare genetic disease, Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is caused by a genetic defect in the survival motor neuron (SMN) gene. It causes motor neurons loss and thereby deteriorates the neuromuscular functioning of the body. It results in muscle weakness, paralysis, progressive loss of movement and is often fatal. Why it needs to be made cheaper?  Although the drug is required by a rare few, with the disease SMA being one of the rarest with an estimated one in 10,000 babies born with it, it needs to be given at the earliest to a child, there is an urgent need to waive off duties and highly subsidize the drug. Before Baby Mithraa  This year itself, before baby Mithraa, two-year-old Ayansh Gupta was in urgent need of Zolgensma to treat his condition of SMA. With a nationwide campaign, amplified requests on social media and several NGOs taking up his cause, 65000 people came together to raise Rs 16 crore. In Ayansh's case too, the government exempted taxes, but after paperwork and submissions.","

196,2021-03-04,22:05:17,business,finance,"Lockdown tax relief for NRIs, foreigners overstaying in India in FY21 [details]"," The Central Board of Direct Taxes will provide relief to NRIs, foreign visitors facing double taxation for overstaying in India due to lockdown and suspension of international flights during current financial year (FY21). Government had earlier given exemption to overseas visitors for their stay in India post March 22 to March 31 (FY20) for determining residential status. But as lockdown continued after that as well and international flight services resumed a lot later, department was sent several representations requesting relaxation even for FY21. The CBDT has now issued a fresh circular where it has clarified that foreign visitors, NRIs, PIOs overstaying in India in FY21 will not face double taxation (in India as well as country of residency) and genuine cases facing such issue would be examined for relief. The board has asked all such individuals facing problems of double taxation due to their forced stay in India in FY21 to provide all information in a new Form -NR by March 31. Based on information provided in the form, CBDT examine whether to extend relaxation in a particular case or for a class of individuals. CBDT circular has clarified that under the provisions of Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAA), chances of an individual getting taxed in two jurisdictions simultaneously is rare and enough protection has been build to protect the tax liability of taxpayers based on residency. Moreover, OECD as well as most of the countries have clarified that in view of the provisions of the domestic income tax law read with the DTAAs, there does not appear a possibility of the double taxation. As per existing regulations, a person is treated to be a resident of India for income tax purposes if he/she is in India for 182 days or more during the financial year or if he/she is in India for at least 365 days during the 4 years preceding that year and at least 60 days in that year. Overstaying in India While the rule is quite flexible giving ample time visitors not to face a change in their residency status, due to the pandemic and lockdown several overseas visitors had to overstay in India even in FY21. This meant that all their earnings during the stay in the country would qualify to be taxed as per rates applicable to an Indian resident. This has become a big disincentive for visitors from low tax countries. The changes proposed by CBDT in the new circular clarifies the position of the tax department and will attempt to exempt extended stay of foreign visitors and NRIs in India due to lockdown in April and few days thereafter for determining the residential status. This will allow overseas visitors not to be clubbed as Indian resident in FY21 for tax purposes. At the time of extending relief for March stay in August, last year finance ministry had said that a circular excluding the period of stay of these individuals up to the date of normalisation of international flight operations, for determination of the residential status for the financial year 2020-21 shall be issued after the flights are resumed.

197,2021-03-03,16:37:21,business,finance,Health Insurance: How to select adequate sum insured to secure all family members," If there is one thing that the Coronavirus crisis has taught the world, it is the importance of having health insurance. Over 113 million people across the world have already come under the grip of the COVID-19 virus with over 2.5 million deaths. The second wave of the deadly virus is said to be even more dangerous and more infectious.  Those who have been infected have had to face a financial setback along with emotional trauma due to the expensive medical care costs. Of those who were hospitalised, less than four per cent had insurance, which meant that the huge treatment cost had to be paid from their pockets, turning their entire financial planning upside down. As per reports, treatment of a Covid-19 patient, without ventilators or other life-saving equipment, costs between Rs 20,000 and 25,000 daily on an average. This translates to Rs 2.8 lakh to Rs 3.5 lakh for a 14-day treatment of a patient. And it is not just Covid-19, healthcare costs are on a rise and there needs to be a plan in place to ensure that a health crisis for a family does not become a financial crisis. Having medical insurance, and with sufficient cover, could be an answer to such unforeseen expenses not only in times of the Coronavirus, but in general as well. A medical emergency could happen at any stage of your life, and hence it is imperative that you have a plan in place to ensure that your other goals are not compromised. Types of health insurance plans There are various kinds of health insurance plans available in the market that suit different needs. Let's find out what they are and which one works for you. Individual cover: An individual health insurance policy, as the name suggests, provides an individual a cover against medical expenses in case of emergencies or even for planned treatments. These plans are ideal for young professionals who are unmarried and are in their 20s and early 30s. Since at this age, they would have lower health risks, they would have the advantage of locking in a big health cover at a relatively lower premium.  Family-floater plan: As opposed to an individual cover that protects only one person, a family-floater plan covers the medical expenses of the entire family which may arise due to any medical emergency. So effectively, you pay a single premium for a single policy, but get coverage for your whole family. Of course, the premium is higher than the individual cover, but much lower compared to a situation where you buy an individual plan for each family member. The sum assured under the plan can be used by any family member who needs it due to a medical emergency.  Critical illness cover: The two health insurance plans discussed so far cover the hospital expenses and pre-and-post-hospitalisation expenses. They do not compensate for the lost income one may incur due to a health emergency. A critical illness cover, on the other hand, covers the policyholder against specified life-threatening diseases like cancer, stroke and heart-related ailments, and provides a lump-sum payment when one is diagnosed by any such ailment. This amount can pay for healthcare costs not covered by traditional health insurance, or can even be used for other purposes as the policyholder may deem fit. A critical illness cover is ideal for those with a family history of critical illnesses and those who are sole breadwinners of the family. It can be bought as a standalone policy or even as a rider with your regular health insurance plan. Selecting adequate coverage You compare health insurance plans to carefully select a policy that is right for you, you pick an insurer you can trust and you pay your premium on time. However, when tragedy strikes, you find out that the sum insured that you chose as part of your health plan does not cover the entire cost of treatment. This is a mistake you must avoid, and you can do that by carefully selecting a sum insured that is adequate for you and your family. Here are the parameters that you must consider to select the right cover amount: Age: Your age plays a very important role in determining the right health insurance coverage for you. If you are young and healthy, you can have a lower sum insured as the risk of acquiring serious ailments is low. As your age increases, you need a higher sum insured to take care of increasing medical expenses. In case of a family health insurance plan, you should consider the age of the oldest member because it would be that member who is most likely to use a higher proportion of the sum insured. Number of members: In case of a family-floater plan, the number of family members covered under the policy is a crucial factor to select the right coverage. For example, if you are buying a policy for just yourself and your spouse, the sum assured can be relatively lower compared to a situation where you also include your parents and/or children under the same policy. This becomes important especially in case of an infectious disease like Covid-19 which can put you in a position where each member requires medical care during the same policy year. A new policy for Covid-19 can also be bought, apart from Family-floater.  Existing ailments: Based on the life stage you are in, and the kind of pre-existing ailments you may have, you should select an appropriate cover amount. Also, if you have a history of any medical condition in your family, your sum Insured should factor in the possibility of being diagnosed with such an ailment. In a nutshell, those with pre-existing conditions and family history of serious ailments should consider a higher cover which covers the treatment cost of those ailments. Lifestyle and personal habits: The kind of job and stress associated with it, lifestyle habits, and other personal habits is an indication of an individual's future healthcare needs. Those whose jobs involve a higher exposure to risk should consider higher coverage. For example, frontline workers who had to interact with people constantly during the pandemic were at a higher risk of infection, and should have higher cover.  Place of residence: Healthcare costs vary substantially from place to place, and this should be factored in when you buy an insurance policy. For example, cost of treatment of common ailments and non-critical surgeries is lower in tier-2 and tier-3 cities compared to metro cities. Similarly, the cost of private rooms is also substantially lower in smaller cities. So, those living in metro cities should essentially have a higher sum insured than those living in smaller towns and cities. Taking the next steps If you are wondering if there is an easy way to determine the right sum insured for you without getting into its technicalities, you could use a health insurance calculator on the website of Bajaj Allianz General Insurance. All you need to do is enter details like the number of people to be covered by the policy, the age of the oldest member and the place of residence, among others. The calculator does the rest and gives you options to choose the right policy for you. If you like the recommendations, you can simply go ahead and purchase a policy instantly in a few simple steps. It is always better to choose a reliable insurance partner that has a good record of settling claims, including cashless health insurance claims, quickly and with ease.

200,2021-02-07,10:49:20,business,finance,"Delhi Metro suffers Rs 1,500 crore losses during lockdown; financial stress burdens DMRC [details]"," The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has been facing a financial stress with the losses to the tune of Rs 1,500 crore during the heydays of the pandemic induced lockdown. Metro operations were halted during lockdown for a period of roughly six months, which drastically affected revenue from passenger travel. At the same time, operating expenses including Operation and Maintenance (O&M) costs had to be continuously paid for the upkeep of the metro network which spans 285 stations and a total track length of 389 km. Additionally, there had been a decline in the non-fare revenue garnered from advertisement as well as shop rentals for the months when metro operations had been suspended. The DMRC has around 400 retail outlets at its stations. Owners of these retail shops have expressed their inability to pay rent to the DMRC on account of no sales. Even now, when the metro services have been resumed, it has been done with sub optimal capacity on account of following strict social distancing norms. DMRC loans In addition, the Delhi Metro had taken a soft loan of Rs 35,198 crore from Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) at a concessional rate of 1.2-2.3 per cent for 30 years. For the financial year 2020-21, DMRC is required to pay Rs 1,242.8 crore of which Rs 434.1 crore is the interest while Rs 808.7 crore is the principal amount. However, till July 2020, DMRC had been able to pay only Rs 79.2 crore as interest payment. In the wake of financial distress, the DMRC has turned to seek financial assistance from the Central Government, Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh governments. It is learnt that the DMRC has written to the Central and state governments requesting financial help. It is yet to be seen whether the Central and the state governments come to the rescue of the DMRC since they too are reeling under high fiscal deficit. This is for the first time that the Delhi Metro is facing operational losses. Since 2002, the DMRC has never faced an operational loss owing to efficiency in operations and world class service standards. To tide over its financial stress, the Delhi Metro is brainstorming innovative methods of revenue generation. The DMRC is following a two-pronged strategy of curtailing expenditure wherever possible and deferment of non-essential expenditure. It has decided to reduce perks and allowances of its employees to about 50 per cent in the coming financial year and also requested the Centre to defer the payment of its loan instalment to JICA for the year 2020-21. A Parliamentary Committee report had suggested innovative methods of revenue realisation for the DMRC. The average non-fare revenue of Metro, across the world, comprising of revenue from advertisements, property leasing and consultancy is close to around 40-50 per cent of total traffic revenue. However, for the DMRC, non-fare revenue accounts for only 15 per cent, which is abysmally low. In order to tackle this challenge, the committee suggested leasing of existing assets i.e. track and rolling stock, leasing of commercial spaces at stations, advertisement fee, parking fee as well as revenue generation by levying a cess on residential property development of nearby areas which have seen enhancement in value owing to metro operations.

202,2021-01-22,18:57:23,business,finance,"Should you buy Bitcoin; cryptocurrency falls below $30K, worst weekly loss in months"," As the world went gaga over the overall value of all cryptocurrencies surpassing the $1 trillion mark and Bitcoin crossing the $40,000 mark, the cryptocurrency saw its sharpest fall since September last year, hitting under $30,000 this week and hovering around $31,000 on Friday. Two weeks ago, Bitcoin hit $42,000, but it is now down 30 per cent from that record high. According to reports, increasing calls for regulation is the reason Bitcoin has crashed so big. At a US Senate hearing earlier this week, Janet Yellen, US President Joe Biden's nominee for Treasury Secretary, suggested that lawmakers must ""curtail"" the use of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin over concerns that they are being used for illegal activities. ""Cryptocurrencies are a particular concern. I think many are used -- at least in a transaction sense -- mainly for illicit financing. I think we really need to examine ways in which we can curtail their use and make sure that money laundering doesn't occur through those channels,"" she said. European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde said last week that Bitcoin has been used for some ""totally reprehensible money-laundering activity"". This suggests that the Biden administration may be hostile to cryptocurrencies and increase regulation in months to come. Scott Minerd, Guggenheim Global CIO, said he expects that Bitcoin will retrace back to $20,000, reports Seeking Alpha. Buyers are aggressively accumulating more and more Bitcoins. This is the driving factor that earlier propelled the price growth of BTC towards all-time high. The second largest cryptocurrency 'Ethereum' has soared over the past 12 months, after trading above $1,200 for the first time since early 2018. According to Christopher Wood of Jefferies, Bitcoin represents a legitimate alternative to gold for risk averse capital looking for a store of value. Wood said that Bitcoin was up 305 per cent for the whole of 2020. In this respect, the total market capitalisation of Bitcoin at the end of 2020 was $539 billion, compared with estimates of $12 trillion in above ground gold, Wood noted earlier this month. Recently, Bitcoin surpassed Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathway in market capitalization and only ranks behind Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook, Tencent, Tesla, Alibaba and Taiwan Semiconductor in global market capitalisation league tables.

Maybe, more. Now, India's craft beer revolution got a leg up (and  the right leap) with the Japanese beer maker group Kirin Holdings, all set to buy a stake in Indian craft beer maker Bira 91. As per the first set of reports, the Japanese brewer will invest about $30 billion for a single digit percentage stake (less than 10 per cent) in the craft beer maker Bira.  What the deal means In August last year it was reported that parent company of Bira, B9 Beverages had been in talks with international brewers and investors, including Kirin, to sell a stake of upto 20 per cent in the company. ""The investment will allow Bira which has posted losses due to Covid-pandemic to break even in the fiscal year 2021-22. The investment will also allow Bira to accelerate its expansion plans and enter the Japanese market later this year,"" Bira CEO Ankur Jain told Reuters.  More about Kirin   The deal will be Japanese group's first big bet on premium craft beer in India.  So far, Kerin Holdings has struggled in international acquisitions, even though it has ventured into Myanmar and Philippines market, apart from others. With the current stake, the Japanese beer maker looks to improve upon its record of overseas deals and hopes to leverage out of $90 billion global craft beer industry.  Kerin has a chequered history of overseas deals, especially in Brazil and Australia, the markets its eventually exited.   A bit about Bira It was only as recently as in the summer of 2015 that Bira 91 was established by B9 Beverages. Headquartered in New Delhi, in 2017 the beer company leaped across to New York City and in 2018, the brand got even more ambitious with the expansion plans and entered Singapore market. By the end of 2017, Bira secured $35 million of external investment, including funds from US venture capital firm Sequoia Capital. Indian craft beer industry, in nutshell   As per one of the data and analytics company Global Data, the India craft beer market has had a staggering compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 304% during the period 2014 and 2018. That is also the period when a significant number of microbreweries popped up, especially in Tier I and Tier II cities across the country.

207,2020-12-20,01:16:16,business,finance,Once billionaire BR Shetty's company sold for ONE dollar; it used to be worth $2 billion," Rags to riches makes for inspirational stories, unfortunately riches to rags is what makes for a viral story. Interestingly, India has plenty of both. One of those joining the list happens to be UAE-based Indian billionaire BR Shetty's company Finablr Plc, which is getting ready to sell its business to an Israeli-UAE consortium for a shocking $1. It was only last December the company was valued at $2 billion (Rs 14,700 crore). The company reported more than $1 billion in undisclosed debts in April. Finablr, the platform for payments and foreign exchange solutions, announced that it has entered into a ""definitive agreement"" with Global Fintech Investments Holding (GFIH) to sell the entire issued share capital of Finablr Limited. It must be noted that GFIH is an affiliate of the Prism Group of Israel, which is linked to former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. The deal also happens to be one of the major step further among significant commercial transactions between UAE and Israeli companies after the countries signed a normalisation accord this year. Billionaire to bankrupt ---the backstory The fact that Indian immigrant to the UAE, Bavaguthu Raghuram Shetty once upon a time had a private jet, vintage cars, two floors of the obscenely expensive Burj Khalifa, guest list that comprised politicians, Bill Gates and Bollywood A-listers, should sum up his billionaire status. Founder of NMC Health (once the biggest private healthcare company in the United Arab Emirates) had everything going for him. He'd make statements about his love for fast cars, penchant for solving problems and living life the way he's always envisioned. Till one Muddy Waters comes along. A controversial research firm known for exposing accounting frauds in Chinese companies, among others. Last December, Muddy Waters released a report on NMC Health accusing the company of falsifying accounts, by understating its debt by $4.5 billion in 2019. As for the financial services firm Finablr, also listed on LSE, it was found out that cheques worth $100 million were issued from the company without the board's knowledge. The entire house of cards had come crumbling down, after one thing led to another. Shetty has claimed throughout his downfall that he himself is the victim, by alleging fraud and misappropriation within NMC.","

209,2020-11-26,16:27:52,business,finance,Can I buy multiple term insurance policies?," There is no denying the fact that the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has changed people's lives. However, it has also changed the way they think about their future. There is uncertainty everywhere, a fear of the unknown, and hesitation to lead our lives the way we used to before the pandemic struck. Almost 50 million people have already come in the grasp of the COVID-19 virus and of those; over 1.2 million people have lost their lives1. Even in India, COVID-19 has claimed over 1.25 lakh lives with over 8 million recorded infections2. With the second wave of the virus already hitting Europe, there is a realization that maybe we need to learn to live with the virus for a long time to come. It is in these circumstances having a backup plan to secure your family's future has become even more critical. This is where a term plan comes in as an affordable and effective way to create financial security for your family. By having a term plan, you ensure that in case of an unfortunate event, your family's financial future is secure. With the right riders, a term plan can also cover you against critical illnesses like heart diseases and cancer if they ever strike. However, a bigger question is whether it is advisable, or even possible, to have more than one term insurance policy. Before we answer this question, there is a need to understand why one would want to have more than one term insurance cover. There are several benefits of having multiple term insurance policies: How much term life insurance cover do you need? There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. The amount of term life insurance coverage you need depends on a number of factors. A good place to start is factoring in the monthly expenses of your dependents. The sum assured must be enough to cover these expenses at the least. Then you also need to factor in inflation, as these expenses would only grow over time. You also need to assess your life goals and events like your children's education and marriage. The term cover you choose must factor in these one-time expenses. Then there is a question of how big a retirement corpus do you want to leave for your spouse to ensure his or her financial stability in case of an unfortunate event. While this may all sound quite complicated, you could make use of a term insurance calculator like the one available at the Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance website. In just a few steps, this easy-to-use calculator helps you determine an estimate of the amount of insurance that can meet your needs and help you get your family's life goals done. All you need to do is furnish your annual income, the years of employment left, and your monthly expenses. A good idea is to take separate term policies to cover your liabilities as discussed earlier in this article. You could also divide the sum assured that you arrive at into more than one policy to cover your family against the rejection of the claim. However, here are a few ways to avoid rejection of your claim: Irrespective of whether you are planning your first, second, or third term life insurance plan, you could consider online term plans from Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance. All you need to do is log in to the website, select a product that suits your needs, submit your details, choose the policy variant, submit the documents, and pay the premium. Voila! You are now covered. Buying a second or even a third term life insurance is not as complex an idea as many people believe. Having different term life insurance plans for different financial objectives would ensure that your insurance needs are met. For example, you could have one term insurance plan for securing your family's future, another when you are planning to take a home loan, and one for protecting your retirement. That way, you would be able to customize each plan as per the requirements of each specific goal.

The opinion was also shared by Viral Acharya a former RBI deputy governor. As per a report in the Mint, the economist duo called the proposal a ""bad idea"" in a note published on Monday on LinkedIn. Criticizing the timing of the proposal they argued that the need for such a proposal is futile when ""India is still trying to learn the lessons from failures like IL&FS & Yes Bank."" ""Why is there an urgency to change the regulation? After all, committees are rarely set up out of the blue. Is there some dramatic change in perception that it is responding to?"" the former RBI officials asked. The note further added, ""Many technical rationalizations proposed by RBI's Internal Working Group are worth adopting, while its main recommendation, to allow Indian corporate houses into banking, is best left on the shelf."" Highlighting the whole process of lending if the corporates own banks, they also questioned, ""The history of... connected lending is invariably disastrous -- how can the bank make good loans when it is owned by the borrower? Even an independent committed regulator, with all the information in the world, finds it difficult to be in every nook and corner of the financial system to stop poor lending."" Notably, On Monday, S&P Global Ratings also raised doubts over allowing corporate ownership in banks in the midst of major corporate defaults over the past several years, given India's poor corporate governance. What did the RBI panel propose?  Last week an RBI panel indicated that large companies could be allowed to promote banks, as well as raising the ceiling on private sector banks' share of promoters to 26 percent, from the existing15 percent. In order to avoid related loans and exposures between banks and other financial and non-financial community entities, the RBI panel recommended that companies should be permitted to regulate banks after required amendments to the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. The RBI also proposed that it will be permitted to convert to a bank only well-managed NBFCs with over 10 years of experience and Rs. 50,000 crore of assets.","

It is to be noted that in September this year, the Reserve Bank of India formed a three-member committee under the leadership of Mita Makhan to run the cash-strapped bank. In fact, the bank was in urgent need of capital due to a fall in assets and had been scrambling to find a buyer for the past one year. According to the report, the troubles of the bank started increasing in the year 2019 when the RBI rejected its proposal to merge with India bank Finance.","

212,2020-11-17,22:57:24,business,finance,Lakshmi Vilas Bank depositors fret not; your money is safe," The banking sector underwent some of the biggest changes in the recent history and adding to that pile of failing banks, frozen debt funds is the moratorium on their money in Lakshmi Vilas Bank (LVB). As India woke to the news of LVB, its depositors' were naturally panicked, but there's no reason to worry. LVB is considerably a small bank and has a marginal impact in the banking sector. But depositors who have their money saved in their LVB accounts shouldn't panic as the RBI and the Indian government has taken well-sought steps to contain any chaos. There's a Rs 25,000 cash withdrawal cap in a month for customers till December 16. Money is safe RBI already has a plan in motion - LVB will be merged with DBS Bank India, its shareholders will be wiped out and all depositors will be paid in full after the moratorium. Also, the Tier 2 bonds are protected, so anyone concerned shouldn't be worried. LVB depositors, with the permission of RBI, will be able to withdraw more money for medical treatment, fees for the payment of higher education, and marriage expenses. Otherwise, depositors must wait out the moratorium period to be able to withdraw their money with ease. LVB's troubles It is to be noted that in September this year, the Reserve Bank of India formed a three-member committee under the leadership of Mita Makhan to run the cash-strapped bank.

216,2020-10-15,22:47:11,business,finance,GST compensation: Centre to borrow ₹1.1 lakh crore for state governments | What it means," The central government today announced to borrow Rs. 1.1 lakh crore to fund Goods and Services Tax shortfalls of the state governments. The decision means that the centre has relented under the pressure from the non- BJP state governments that the Finance Ministry should borrow on their behalf. Centre will borrow under the special window to meet the shortfall of GST compensation. In an announcement made on Twitter, finance ministry wrote, ""Under the Special Window, the estimated shortfall of Rs 1.1 lakh crore (assuming all States join) will be borrowed by Government of India in appropriate tranches."" Under the Special Window, the estimated shortfall of ₹1.1 lakh cr (assuming all States join) will be borrowed by Govt of India in appropriate tranches.The amount so borrowed will be passed on to the States as a back-to-back loan in lieu of GST Compensation Cess releases. (5/8) What does it mean to the state governments? The announcement would mean that state governments would not be forced to borrow funds to finance the shortfall aroused out of multiple reasons including lower than expected revenue and lockdown. Ever since its roll-out, revenue collection through GST has been sluggish and strict lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic further dented the government exchequer severely. The successive meetings of GST council went inconclusive as non-BJP states were reluctant on centre borrowing and then compensating the state governments. Instead, the Ministry of Finance gave two options to states to meet their GST compensation requirements. Under Option 1, the central government had mooted a special borrowing window from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for GST-related compensation. As per the centre's measurement, the collective amount stands at Rs 97,000 crore. Under Option 2, the states can borrow a greater sum of Rs 2.35 lakh crore from the market. The latter option also takes into consideration the short arouse due to the COVID related shortfall. If the centre has decided to borrow the Rs 1.1 lakh crore and extend it to the states as a back-to-loans, I welcome the change of position. I thank all the economists, academics and newspaper editors who had supported our position. Former FM Chidambaram welcomes the move Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram has welcomed the government.

Option 1 includes borrowing through a special window. As per a report by CNBC, Yediyurappa argued that it would be eligible for Rs 18,289 crore under the Option 1, calling it ""more beneficial"" for Karnataka. Calling the option 2 unfeasible, the state government said that the state would not have access to unconditional borrowing of 1% of GSDP, which is estimated at Rs 18,036 crore. This option would also bring down the net borrowing of the state by Rs 10,817 crore. Moreover, the State itself will have to pay the interest on the borrowing under Option 2 from its own resources, which the state does not prefer. In a press statement, the state government said, ""After the evaluation of both the options, it is felt that Option 1 would be more beneficial to the state's finances. Hence, the government of Karnataka has decided to convey to the Government of India its preference for Option 1.""

218,2020-09-01,15:00:14,business,finance,How ULIPs will fulfil your financial life goals?," Unit Linked Insurance Plans (ULIPs) have become a popular investment option of late, due to the hybrid nature and the benefits they provide. A ULIP lets you enjoy 2 components i.e. protection of a life insurance cover and simultaneously provide investment opportunities. The investment continues for the tenure of the insurance policy. Thus, whether you are a conservative investor or a risk-taker, there is a ULIP for you. ULIPs are further important in the current scenario, wherein in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic; investment habits have witnessed a sharp change. People are now thinking of buying less and saving more. The most prominent change has been pointed out in the millennials, known for their attitude of 'buy now pay later.' They are now thinking of saving and investing for rainy days [1]. In such a situation, ULIPs appeal more, as they help you achieve your life goals with the vitality of the market conditions provided you have planned well. ULIPs: How is it instrumental in meeting long-term savings goals? ULIPs serve as one of the preferred long-term goal-based investment products with the life insurance cover element, at the same time to help accumulate wealth and generate returns over the tenure of the policy. Here is why you may invest to achieve your long-term savings goals via ULIPs:  Dual benefit ULIPs come with two benefits; the protection that comes with insurance and the savings accumulation that comes with the associated funds. The longer you invest the better returns you may get. Additionally, the insurance component takes care of your protection needs by providing a financial cover. It also ensures that your loved ones stay protected in your absence. You can take your pick from a single premium ULIP or a regular premium ULIP that can be with monthly, quarterly, bi-annual, or annual frequency ∧ reap the protection and investment benefits therein.  Better investment corpus ULIPs come with the function of compounding, i.e. the returns on your existing investment are reinvested in the near future. This process generates additional income over the tenure of the ULIP. ULIPs come with a lock-in period of 5 5 years. This creates an investment corpus, in the end, helping you achieve market-linked returns by the end of your set tenure. Higher transparency ULIP charges are clearly defined in the benefit illustration and policy document. Usually, there are three; mortality charges, administration charges, allocation charges, and fund management charges. Further, there is a surrender charge if you wish to end the policy before its lock-in period ends. How these are charged on the investment portion of the premium further depends on the insurance company. The methodology of charging is the same. It is the actual charge that varies. Tax benefit You can avail of an income deduction of up to 1.5 lakh per year under section 80C of the Income Tax Act 1961 (the Act). Further, all the ULIP payouts are exempt under section 10 (10D) of the Act and such deduction and exemptions are subject to terms and conditions stated therein. Better security with Switch fund feature ULIPs offer a unique benefit of switching funds so that you can leverage optimum returns. This option can be exercised in the event of one or more ULIP funds from your portfolio not performing as well as you wished it to. Insurance companies such as Bajaj Allianz Life provide switching without any additional charges. However, ensure that you are aware of how your portfolio and funds are performing, to make an informed decision. ULIPs can be one of the choices for you for your investments if you wish to set long-term financial goals. As per a recent report by Principal Retirement Advisors, the two topmost long-term goals that are being pursued by new-age parents are buying a house so that they can retire from professional life in peace (55%) and children's' education and marriage (68%) [2]. ULIPs can be instrumental here. You can start investing in your child's name at the time of birth so that you can garner and accumulate substantial funds to be utilized for goals like higher education and marriage. There are a few ULIP's that come with a big advantage that it does not discontinue in the event of the death of the parent. While the death benefit is paid to the nominees immediately, the investment continues to remain invested and the beneficiary gets the fund value at the time of maturity of the policy subject to policy terms and conditions. ULIP: The wealth accumulation option for the long run ULIPs are one of the preferred long term investment options that can help you enjoy the protection of an insurance cover and simultaneously provide investment opportunities. ULIPs help to build a corpus amount aside at the time of retirement or any other life goal. You just have to figure out which insurance company can help you in the best way possible.

220,2020-08-24,13:55:32,business,finance,Finance Ministry lauds GST era: Marked reductions in tax rates; tax payer base doubles to 1.24 crore," It's the first death anniversary of Arun Jaitley and the finance ministry described him as one who 'played a key role' in the GST implementation. To commemorate the occasion, the ministry released information on the successes of the GST era. GST implementation began in 2017. It has had its fair share of criticism, especially on certain sectors and commodities. However, the finance ministry released today certain areas where it has improved the situation. Finance ministry on expansion of taxpayer base The finance ministry issued a series of tweets on Monday morning, ""On the first death anniversary of Shri Arun Jaitley, we pay our respects and remember his lasting contribution to nation-building and the legacy he left behind as Union Finance Minister during 2014-19."" Further, ""As we remember Shri Arun Jaitley today, let us acknowledge the key role he played in the implementation of GST, which will go down in history as one of the most fundamental landmark reforms in Indian taxation."" The goal of the GST was to regularise a standard rate of taxation across India, ""Before GST, the combination of VAT, Excise, Central Sales Tax and the cascading effect of tax on tax resulted in the standard rate of tax being as high as 31% in many cases,"" the ministry said in a tweet on Monday morning.  However, the ministry has said following the implementation of the GST taxpayer base has grown over the years from 65 lakh before implementation to 1.24 crore, ""The multiple markets across India, with each state charging a different rate of tax, led to huge inefficiencies and costs of compliance. Under GST, compliance has been improving steadily. The taxpayer base has almost doubled to 1.24 crore."" The ministry also said that now with GST the rate at which people need to pay taxes has come down significantly, ""GST has reduced the rate at which people have to pay tax. The revenue-neutral rate as per the RNR Committee was 15.3%. Compared to this, the weighted GST rate at present, according to the RBI, is only 11.6%."" Furthermore, contradicting the criticisms against the GST implementation, the ministry has insisted that GST has made taxpayers more compliant. Moreover, it said that GST is 'taxpayer-friendly' in its outlook. Comparison of pre-GST and GST tax rates The ministry revealed about rate changes that, ""Now, Businesses with an annual turnover of up to Rs 40 lakh are GST exempt. Initially, this limit was Rs 20 lakh. Additionally, those with a turnover up to Rs 1.5 crore can opt for the Composition Scheme and pay only 1% tax.""  It also talked about the items that fall under higher tax slabs and how the 28% rate is restricted to sin and luxury items, ""Out of a total of about 230 items in the 28% slab, about 200 items have been shifted to lower slabs."" The GST has also brought relief to the construction sector the ministry said, ""Significant relief has been extended to the construction sector, particularly the housing sector. It has now been placed at the 5% rate. GST on affordable housing has been reduced to 1%."" The ministry released a list of certain items showing the different between pre-GST and GST rates. Most daily use items have been brought under the 5% rate, while appliances saw a reduction from 31.3% to 18%.  Common-use items also saw a reduction from 29.3% to 18% under GST.

221,2020-08-14,22:16:09,business,finance,"Explained: How did RBI arrive at Rs 57,128cr dividend declaration for FY21"," RBI approved a dividend of Rs 57,128 cr For FY21 and decided to maintain 5.5 percent of the expanded balance sheet as contingency risk reserve or retained earnings. How did RBI arrive at the numbers? Latha Venkatesh from CNBC-TV18 explains the math behind the numbers of surplus earnings, reserve funds and income sources for the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). RBI proves the budget estimate of Rs 89,000 crore wrong. How? With RBI declaring its balance sheet earnings every week in its weekly supplement, the RBI balance sheet has expanded from Rs 41 lakh crore last year to around Rs 53 lakh crore this year. This shows an expansion of 12 lakh crore or around 30 percent this fiscal. Of the Rs 12 lakh crore earnings, if RBI has decided to keep 5.5 percent as its contingency risk reserve fund then, the amount would be Rs 66,000 crore. So if you took the same surplus of RBI as it made last year, which was Rs 1.23 lakh crore minus Rs 66,000 crore (which is 5.5 percent of the expanded balance sheet) then, you could easily arrive at an approximate of Rs 57,000 crore plus, and not Rs. 89,000 crore as the budget had earlier estimated. How does the RBI's P&L work? What are the sources of income for RBI? RBI's income comes from dollar sales. ""It makes a lot of money from dollar sales, because if you see the historical purchase price numbers, it works to an average of Rs. 52 per US dollar, and every dollar is sold at around Rs. 75 per US dollar, so it makes a niche Rs 22 on every dollar sold,"" according to CNBC-TV18 report. Besides this, the other source of income for RBI is interest earned on foreign currency reserves - approximately 530 billion dollars are invested in dollars or treasury bills. And as you know treasury bills are at negative or zero interest rates, which means this makes very little money for RBI, probably about just 1%. Income from gold revaluation is a tidy amount this year. Also, revaluation of government bonds brings in some money, which is positive this year to be noted. As the yields fall, there is a rise in bond prices. Any fresh bonds purchased are called Seigniorage - as RBI prints the money which could approximately cost Rs 1000 crore. What is seigniorage? ""It is the cost of printing money, the difference between the face value of money, such as a $10 bill or a quarter coin, and the cost to produce it. If the seigniorage is positive, the government will make an economic profit; while a negative seigniorage will result in an economic loss,"" as clearly defined by the Investopedia. At the 584th meeting of the Central Board of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) held today under the Chairmanship of Shaktikanta Das, Governor through video conference, a proposal for setting up of an Innovation Hub to mitigate the economic impact of Covid-19 pandemic was also being discussed. ""The purchase made by RBI in terms of bonds, the entire Open market operations (OMO) is mark-to-market gain and this accounts for the total revenues. The expenditure here is however minimal, which is mainly running expenses of the central bank (salaries and administration)."" Also, interest being paid on the reverse repo is huge. Everyday RBI absorbs approximately Rs 7 lakh crore and pays an interest rate of 3.35 percent as of August 14, 2020 on the reverse repo, according to the news report. Taking all this into consideration, the CNBC-TV18 report explains, ""You can easily calculate the surplus RBI can make, which would approximate to Rs 1.2 lakh crore.""","

The remaining Rs 500 has to be paid by the customers only when they dine at the restaurant, according to a statement by the restaurant association. ""The NRAI has developed this programme keeping in mind the current plight of its members and their employees. Yet, unlike any other platform offering gift vouchers, etc, this is the only program which recognizes the concern that customers may have regarding the future recovery of restaurants and therefore, only requests 25 percent of the virtual cash value upfront,"" said NRAI Managing Committee Member Gauri Devidayal. To stay afloat during the Covid-19 times, Anurag Katriar suggests the F&B industry and restaurants to, ""Re-imagine their business, recast their business model, cut down on expenses as much as possible, look at the digital economy, become asset-light and low-risk.""","

Under which section was the penalty imposed by RBI? RBI exercised its powers as the central monetary authority of India to levy non-compliance charges (penalties on banks) under the provisions of section 47A (1) (c) read with sections 46 (4) (i) and Section 51 (1), Section 56 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (the Act). The action by RBI is based on the deficiencies in regulatory compliance. However, the penalty is not intended to be pronounced upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into, by the bank with its customers.

230,2020-05-22,19:18:06,business,finance,How will RBI's extended moratorium on all loans help home loan borrowers?," With the coronavirus outbreak bringing global economies to a standstill to impact on individual and business earnings, paying back EMIs is a huge headache for an average salaried or self-employed Indian. To address liquidity concerns for individuals and businesses availing loan facilities from financial and non-financial lending institutions, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das announced on March 27, a moratorium on loans for 3 months, outstanding as of March 1, 2020, to be extended till May 31, 2020. This move by RBI is intended to help users struggling with liquidity and cash crunch. Considering the Covid-19 is still not contained during the months post nationwide lockdown imposed on March 24 across India, RBI today has extended the moratorium period by another 3 months to now cover - June, July and August. It will now end on 31 August 2020. This makes it a total of six months moratorium on all loans from March 1, 2020, till August 31, 2020, applicable on home loans as well. All lending institutions to include regional rural banks (RRBs), commercial private sector banks, co-operative banks, local-area and small finance banks, NBFCs including housing finance companies have been permitted by RBI to allow for a moratorium on all loans, including housing loans. RBI has clarified that while the loan repayment schedule, subsequent due dates, and the tenor for all loans will be shifted by another three months, the moratorium placed in effect will not lead to changes in the terms and conditions of the loan agreements signed earlier. What is a moratorium and how does it help meet immediate liquidity requirements? A moratorium should not be confused with a waiver on EMI payments, but a postponement or deferment of activity to allow for payment by borrowers at a later date. In case, your installment payments on loans (EMIs) were due between March 1, 2020, and August 31, 2020, the RBI has now allowed banks/lending institutions to allow for the postponement of repayment for a longer period of time by six months. However, not all banks are obliged to do so. Since different banks have different criteria decided during their time of establishment, some financial institutions may not allow for an EMI holiday for the next six months. Those banks that have already allowed for an initial three-month moratorium will continue to provide extension depending on the customer credit history. A moratorium is not a new concept in the housing industry as most borrowers buying an under-construction property ask for a moratorium period. Banks who agree for a moratorium benefit usually offer up to three years, with an applicable condition that the borrower should pay the interest accrued during the moratorium period. This is also called the pre-EMI interest. After the three years moratorium is completed, the borrower has to pay full EMI. In case of a ready-to-move-in property, banks typically offer a moratorium of up to three to six months only. How will this moratorium affect home loan borrowers? How much will they have to repay in EMIs? If you are availing of a moratorium on the home loan, then you will be paying the interest accrued over the period of the next three months, which will further add on to your liability. This means you will be repaying a higher amount with the future EMIs after a six months period, however, the moratorium on housing loan if availed now, will help you plan and rearrange your finances to cope with the crisis in the short-term. The moratorium issued will be applicable both on principal and interest, whether you are paying pre-EMIs or EMIs. The applicable interest rate will keep on accruing on the outstanding portion of the loan amount during the moratorium period. The advantage of seeking a moratorium on home loan should not ideally impact your credit score, but as rules vary from one financial institution to another, you should consult your bank about the impact of the moratorium on your credit score. There will be no penalty charged nor will your credit score be compromised on availing the moratorium extension on home loan EMIs from the bank. In case you have multiple loan repayments to make, then the moratorium will be applicable on all term loans. You should be contacting the financial lending institution (your bank) at the earliest for clarity and more details. For some borrowers, the extra interest accrued could be a small price to pay, but for some others like the self-employed borrowers will undoubtedly feel the pinch of repayments, since business activities have been disrupted owing to ongoing lockdown imposed in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic. Trying to resolve liquidity crunch at the moment by requesting for a moratorium on repayment from banks, does come at a hefty price of payback especially after the 3-month extension is once availed, and the impending arrears could give you sleepless nights New borrowers can defer payment of EMIs up to 3 months, but since there is no waiver on accrued interest applicable, users are not getting any discount on repayments. If a borrower has registered with the bank for Electronic Clearing Service (ECS) mandate for the first week of a month, then the payment for March would have already been paid. This means the borrower can avail of only 2-months deferment of EMIs - April and May, in case of a three-month period. Can a customer request for refund on EMI paid by ECS after March 27? As the moratorium on loans and deferment of interest announcement was made by RBI on March 27, the ECS mandate and EMI payment processed by banks before this date will not be refunded. However, in case your payment was due on March 28, and the EMI amount was automatically debited from your bank account, then you can contact your bank for refunds. Some banks such as ICICI Bank are more than willing to help customers during these crisis times, by assisting with refund settlements and processing moratorium requests. ICICI Bank guidelines read as follows, ""EMI paid prior to Mar 27, 2020, will not be refunded. However, if any EMI is debited after Mar 27, 2020, and the borrower customer opts for moratorium then such EMI may be considered for refund at the request of the borrower/ customer."" Are NRIs eligible for moratorium benefit? Even NRI customers can avail of the moratorium facility and request banks to process the same. State Bank of India (SBI) has made it possible for all borrowers to avail of a moratorium, whether they request for it, need it or not. More clarity is awaited from other banks, who are busy preparing policies to be approved by their board and provide this convenience to all eligible borrowers. If your bank does not offer a moratorium on home loans, then you may be at risk of losing your property in case of defaulting on EMIs. Ensuring liquidity for banks and those investing in real estate ""The moratorium on housing EMI's and deferment of interest payments by another three months will give a lot of relief to consumers as they can now rearrange their finances. Another repo cut by 40 basis points to 4% is also a welcome move. With the cost of funds coming down for banks now, borrowers will stand to gain as the EMIs on their home loan are expected to fall. This is another big announcement which will ease liquidity pressure for developers. However, the quick transmission will be key to the huge liquidity infused by RBI. All these measures augur well for the real estate sector during such trying times. We hope that the government will continue to take all the necessary actions in the near future for the betterment of the overall economy. The current scenario offers excellent investment opportunities in residential real estate as affordability is at an all-time high. The post-pandemic world will be good for the real estate sector, the one sector that will emerge as the silver lining in such a bleak scenario and offers you the best bet - stability, security and safety,"" says Surendra Hiranandani, Chairman and Managing Director, House of Hiranandani. ""To control the inflation and inject more liquidity in the market, a further rate cut is expected as the market is unstable and there is a minimal sign of growth. The growing economic and financial stress will see a massive reduction and the measures overall will help bring in financial stability,"" says Ashok Mohanani, Chairman, EKTA World & President-Elect NAREDCO, Maharashtra. Considering the accrued interest on a moratorium on home loans and the loan against property, which could be significantly higher with long residual tenure and sizeable outstanding loan amount, those with sufficient liquidity should consider servicing their loan payments on time to avoid heavy accrued interest charges. Also, RBI has increased the export credit period to 15 months from 1 year and extended Rs 15,000 crore line of credit to EXIM Bank. This will help ease the liquidity situation with import-export companies. Further, rate cut and reverse repo rate cuts are moves in the right direction. These measures should help revive economic growth positively in H2 FY21.","

233,2020-04-27,19:44:37,business,finance,"Govt mulls Rs 3-lakh crore loan guarantee for small businesses, reveals report"," In plans to kick-start Asia's third-largest economy once again, reeling under the impact of a 40-day nationwide lockdown, people with knowledge of the matter reveal India is deliberating on a proposal to guarantee as much as 3-lakh crore rupees ($39 billion) of loans to small businesses. Mulling loan guarantee for small businesses in India According to sources, small firms will be eligible to borrow an additional 20% of their credit limit, as per the proposal which is under works. This borrowing will be backed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration and the government intends to set up a special fund to pay for any defaults. If banks enhance the credit limit by 20% for all borrowers then the additional part has full absorption guarantee for banks and the financial lending institutions have nothing to lose, but to gain more, considering they have better chances of collecting 100% if the SMEs survive. Coping with the Covid-19 times, governments and regulators are slowly launching new programs for businesses, investors, fund managers, who are struggling with the impact of lockdown affecting manufacturing and other allied activities. An economy set for contraction for the very first time in decades, the Modi government is working on means and mechanisms to make it attractive for banks concerned about rising debts and delinquencies, to be able to extend help to small businesses. Around 100 million workers in the mining, manufacturing, construction and services sectors have been rendered jobless due to continuous lockdown, according to Subhash Chandra Gar, a former top bureaucrat in the finance ministry in his blog. In developed economies such as the US and the UK, a large part of the fiscal package includes loan guarantees. While governments across the globe are ensuring small and medium businesses survive through these trying times, the U.S government has decided to provide $320 billion for new loans under the Paycheck Protection Program. An initiative that will offer forgivable loans to small businesses, to help them retain workforce on the payroll for eight more weeks, while the Philippines government plans to give 35 billion pesos ($690 million) to SME workers of shuttered enterprises. Perhaps if targets are set for banks and shadow banks to avail of refinancing under such a scheme along with credit guarantees assured, then it will to an extent, ensure credit flow to MSMEs and help revive growth. Small businesses have been the bedrock of a $2.7 trillion Indian economy. This is worst hit by the Covid-19 lockdown, with many businesses being disrupted or coming to a standstill. Current loan standing for MSMEs To help resume economic activities, RBI has offered relaxation as requested by the Indian Banks' Association (IBA), a one-time restructuring of existing loans to GST-registered MSME units. While this makes for a very small number of GST-registered MSME units, in comparison with the non-GST accounts. The restructuring which was earlier allowed till March 31, 2020, is extended by the RBI till December 31, 2020. ""Around 900,000 MSMEs are eligible for benefit under the restructuring scheme announced by the RBI. Till January 31, 2020, around 619,562 MSME accounts were restructured by the public sector banks of an amount involving Rs 22,650 crore,"" Business Standard reports. According to RBI data, Banks have already lent a total of Rs 4.78 trillion to small businesses for the fortnight ending February 28, 2020. While the current Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE) scheme guarantees between 50-85% of loans up to Rs 2 crore, the risk-averse lenders now seek assurance for the entire loan amount more than Rs 2 crore, and not limited to Rs 2 crore only. A noteworthy fact is that small businesses in India get the costliest loans as next to unsecured personal loans, notwithstanding their employment creation potential and asset considerations. Sidbi has announced a concessional rate of 5% for MSME loans under its emergency COVID-19 package. MSME loans worth Rs 2.32 lakh crore are at a higher risk of becoming non-performing assets (NPAs) soon as they fall in the highest risk category of 7 to 10, according to credit information firm TransUnion Cibil. The higher ranking suggests a greater risk of small business loans going bad in the upcoming 12 months, news report states. Out of Rs 2.32 lakh crore loans at risk, micro-enterprises having loans of less than Rs 10 lakh, in the highest risk category of CMR-7 to CMR-10, totalling up to Rs 13,600 crore. With Covid-19 presenting new challenges to businesses of all sizes, particularly the small businesses, who are the most vulnerable segments of the economy, the NPA rate has been increasing continuously over the past few years to be at 12.6 per cent in December 2019. To provide some relief to the borrowers, RBI has issued a 90-day moratorium period to be excluded from the NPA classification. Since as per the RBI rules, payments overdue beyond the 90-day period are treated as NPAs. The central bank had announced a moratorium on term-loan instalments due between March 1 and May 31.","

234,2020-04-27,15:26:08,business,finance,What RBI's Special Liquidity Facility mean for the mutual funds industry?," The Covid-19 outbreak has led to heightened volatility in capital markets and intensified redemption pressures to bring some mutual funds to a point of closure. To ease the liquidity burden, the RBI has stepped up its efforts to save mutual funds from closure by allocating Rs 50,000 crore towards special liquidity facility, a move made to address high-risk mutual funds in particular. Last week, Franklin Templeton announced the closure of six funds namely — Franklin India Low Duration Fund (FILDF), Franklin India Credit Risk Fund, Franklin India Dynamic Accrual Fund, Franklin India Ultra Short Bond Fund, Franklin India Short Term Income Plan, and Franklin India Income Opportunities Fund (FIIOF) effective from April 23. Total assets under management of these funds are estimated to be around Rs 25,000 crore. There is a spill-over effect of the closure of these funds on banks, other liquid funds and equity markets as well. These closures have shaken investor confidence in the mutual funds' industry, with the possibility of likely redemption wherein the money would go to banks till the time they get some clarity. What does the Special Liquidity Facility for Mutual funds (SLF-MF) entail? According to the RBI announcement, ""The SLF-MF is on-tap and open-ended MFs, and banks can submit their bids to avail funding on any day from Monday to Friday (excluding holidays). The scheme is available from today i.e., April 27, 2020, till May 11, 2020, or up to utilization of the allocated amount, whichever is earlier. Under the SLF-MF, the RBI shall conduct repo operations of 90 days tenor at the fixed repo rate. The RBI will review the timeline and amount, depending upon market conditions."" While banks will decide the tenor of lending to /repo with mutual funds, the minimum tenor of the repo with RBI will be for a period of three months. This move by the RBI will help soothe the increased tension in the mutual fund industry and help regain investor confidence, perhaps a modified extension of Targeted Long Term Repo Operations (TLTRO) for a short term of 3 months (90 days) rather than a year or three years, catering to specific pain points in the MF industry. Funds availed by banks under the SLF-MF can be used for extending loans, undertaking outright purchase of and/or repos against the collateral of investment-grade corporate bonds, commercial papers (CPs), debentures and certificates of Deposit (CDs) held by MFs. Explaining the rationale behind the SLF-MF facility As this facility extends support to mutual funds, it shall be exempted from banks' capital market exposure limits. Also, exposures under this facility will not be reckoned under the Large Exposure Framework (LEF). This facility announcement by the RBI will boost confidence and reduce the yield volatility as witnessed in the corporate debt market. The RBI announcement clearly stated that ""The liquidity support availed under the SLF-MF would be eligible to be classified as held-to-maturity (HTM) even in excess of 25 per cent of total investment permitted to be included in the HTM portfolio. The face value of securities acquired under the SLF-MF and kept in the HTM category will not be reckoned for computation of adjusted non-food bank credit (ANBC) for the purpose of determining priority sector targets/sub-targets."" The SLF-MF facility will help reduce redemption pressures faced by MFs, to facilitate borrowing from banks at a lower cost in comparison to their banking lines. Similar liquidity support was issued by RBI in 2008, which saw limited utilisation but it proved to be a confidence booster back then. The SLF scheme makes sense for banks - as they can borrow at 4.4 per cent from the RBI and lend at 2 to 2.5 per cent margin. Besides redemption pressure, the mutual fund industry is also faced with a risk aversion issue. If the SLF is restricted to credit risk funds and other such funds that have a higher share of lower-rated assets, then the liquidity facility in itself will not help solve the risk aversion issue. The collateral requirement in the form of securities as per the funding scheme, may not meet the banks' criteria. Only if banks were ready to take these securities as collateral, then they would prefer buying them in the secondary market under TLTRO operations to help the credit risk funds meet redemptions. While the SLF window can be used for an outright sale of securities, it brings to question the issue of credit risk aversion of banks. For now, allocation of funds under SLF-MF is a temporary relief measure for the mutual funds' industry and investors by all means, but RBI has to be cautious to observe if this move does not cause any build-up of leverage that cannot be sustained for long.","

235,2020-04-23,15:50:02,business,finance,"Coronavirus impact: Dearness Allowance for Central govt employees, pensioners frozen till July 2021"," In the wake of the coronavirus crisis, the Narendra Modi government on Thursday, April 23, decided to freeze payment of additional installment of dearness allowance (DA) for all its Central government employees and dearness relief (DR) to pensioners falling due from January 1, 2020. The decision, which will affect around 50 lakh central government employees and 61 lakh pensioners, comes after the Union Cabinet on March 14 approved a four per cent hike in DA to 21 per cent in a bonanza for 1.13 crore employees and pensioners applicable from January, 2020 costing the exchequer Rs 14,595 crore. The Finance Ministry said in its order that additional installment of DA and DR falling due from July 1, 2020 and January 1, 2021 will also not be paid. However, the allowance will continue to be paid at current rates. In an office memorandum, the Finance Ministry said, ""In view of the crisis arising out of Covid-19, it has been decided that additional installment of dearness allowance payable to central government employees and dearness relief (DR) to central government pensioners due from January 1, 2020, shall not be paid."" ""The additional installment of DA and DR due from July 1, 2020, and January 1, 2021, shall also not be paid,"" the Department of Expenditure said in its order. The Central government employees will also not get any arrears in any future revision of DA/DR from July 1, 2021. However, If a decision to revise DA rates is taken for July 1, 2021 period, the rate of allowance as effective from January 1, 2020, July 1, 2020 and January 1, 2021 will be restored prospectively and will be subsumed in the cumulative revised rates effective from July 1, 2021, the office memorandum said. Though the government did not give an estimate of how much it would save by disallowing DA revision for its employees, a four per cent raise approved by cabinet last month meant additional expenditure of around Rs 15,000 crore. For three half yearly periods, going by this yardstick, would result in savings of close to Rs 45,000 for the Centre. Any change in DA rates benefits about 48 lakh Central government employees and 65 lakh pensioners. DA is paid by the government to its employees as well as pensioners to offset the impact of inflation. (With agency inputs)","

236,2020-04-20,19:09:52,business,finance,"Center to put Rs 5,000 crore in EPF accounts of employees and employers | Details inside"," In the wake of the coronavirus outbreak impacting business activities, resulting in salary cuts and unanticipated layoffs, the Government of India will contribute towards EPF payments of both employer and employee (12 percent each), putting together 24 percent for employers with more than 100 staffers on board. The outgo cost of covering EPF of companies for the next 3 months is around Rs. 5,000 crores, according to the EPF India release. This COVID-19 relief measure is announced by the center to be implemented for the next 3 months, ahead of the economic stimulus package due to be announced soon. Earlier last month, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced an Rs.1.7 lakh crore package - a conditional provision to pay the entire provident fund of employees who earn less than Rs 15,000 per month in companies that employ up to 100 workers, wherein 90 percent of the employees' salaries are less than Rs 15,000 per month. How will this EPF contribution help employers? This move will incentivize about 4 lakh establishments and benefit about 80 lakh employees to be able to continue to be on their payrolls despite the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The government plans to widen the net and increase the cap from 100 employees altogether, to cover more and more EPFO subscribers under this scheme for the next 3 months, considering many businesses have faced heavy losses, some on the verge of closure, and operations halted due to nationwide lockdown imposed for close to a month, an emergency move in the wake of raging coronavirus outbreak. As per the scheme, the Government will pay PF only for those employers employing staffers with a salary lower than Rs. 15,000, however, there are few calculation possibilities currently under exploration by the government. Meanwhile, the government is also working out an additional financial implication under two scenarios - a) doing away with the cap altogether or b) raising the cap substantially, based on which a decision can be taken. The EPFO has more than 6-crore subscribers. Other relief schemes by EPFO for employees and employers In another move to incentivize employers of about 6 lakh establishments for payment of wages during the lockdown period, the Government has provided a one-month more extension for the filing of Electronic Challan Cum Return (ECR) for wage month March 2020 up to 15 May 2020, for employers who have paid wages to their employees for March 2020. The ordinarily due date for March 2020 is April 15, 2020. This extension is provided to establishments covered under the EPF & MP Act, 1952 to remit the contributions and administrative charges due for March 2020. This move will likely benefit about 5-crore employees and is decided to align in sync with the objective of the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY) that helps prevent disruption in employment by ensuring employee earnings in their fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, those employers who disburse wages for March 2020 not only get relief of extension of due date for payment of EPF dues for March 2020 but also avoid liability of interest and penalty, if they remit on or before May 15, 2020. Besides offering relief to MSMEs who were hardest hit by the ongoing lockdown from March 24, the Government of India is also offering EPF withdrawal up to 75 percent for nearly 4.8 crore employees. Also as per the provisions notified on March 28, the EPFO has processed 3.31 lakh claims disbursing an amount of Rs. 946.49 crores in a span of 15 days. Additionally, Rs.284 crore has been distributed by the exempted PF Trusts under this scheme, notable among them being TCS. Under this provision, non-refundable withdrawal to the extent of the basic wages and dearness allowances for three months or up to 75% of the amount standing to member's credit in the EPF account, whichever is less, is admissible, the press release states. The member can apply for a lesser amount also. Considering this is an advance provided by the Government as an emergency fund to EPFO subscribers in times of crisis, it does not attract income tax deductions. The Ministry of Labour had urged EPFO and ESIC to carry out a ground-level assessment to prepare a report on the job losses, salary cuts, and layoffs as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.","

The devised rescue plan involved the State Bank of India, the country's largest public lender, taking 49 percent stake in the bank after the central bank placed the lender under a moratorium on March 5. The bank resumed normal operations on March 18. Despite the government-led rescue plan, the bank is still far from stable.","

239,2020-04-03,18:44:17,business,finance,"Post lockdown, Indian aviation sector to take a phased approach of opening up travel gates"," Post lifting the 21-day nationwide lockdown on April 14, the government is planning to take a phased approach to open up its skies for both domestic and international flights. The passenger movement, which had been restricted for the past few days to contain the virus, will soon be opening up. The top 10 airports will open up first for domestic travel, and then the international travel gates will be opened. Why is a phased approach implemented to opening up travel gates? The idea behind this move is to control crowding at airports and make possible identification of coronavirus infected passengers. The top 10 airports of India include those in Pune, Goa, Ahmedabad, Cochin, and Hyderabad, besides four other metro cities. As per directions issued by the aviation regulator, DGCA, all flight bookings are banned until April 14. The airlines will be accepting bookings only from April 15. Also, the international travel is opening up later in phases. This is in view of the fact that many countries have shut down their borders till April end and some even beyond. For example, London has announced a flight ban until April end, while the US is considering a ban on air travel, in light of the exponential rise in Covid-19 cases. ""The government will take a holistic view. When conditions become safer in other countries, we can start flights,"" said civil aviation secretary Pradeep Singh Kharola at a virtual press conference conducted using Zoom, a video conferencing app. This is the first time that India has imposed a 100 percent ban on air transport. Views and other developments Commenting on the phased approach to open domestic travel gates for passengers stuck at different checkpoints during the lockdown, airline executives believe that, ""It is difficult to start 100 percent routes on Day 1. It would take some time for the travel industry to pick up from the setback, before it sees customers making travel plans, only once the coronavirus fears are abated."" Corporate travel, being a high-value revenue-making segment will likely suffer for some more time. ""Airlines were hit by a sledgehammer called Covid-19 in February,"" said Alexandre de Juniac, head of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) in a statement. The global air passenger demand witnessed a steep 14 percent decline in February, thus remarking the steepest decline since September 11 attacks in 2001. Owing to Covid-19 outbreak and thereafter nationwide lockdown imposed, DGCA has extended the validity for individual license holders and operators facing issues in completing their requirements towards renewal, issuance of various Pilot Licenses and Ratings, and to exercise the privileges of their respective licenses and ratings including temporary authorizations(FATA) up to 90 days from March 23, 2020.","

240,2022-03-31,23:45:40,technology,smartphones,OnePlus 10 Pro review: A wholesome flagship," The anticipation around the OnePlus 10 Pro's launch is finally over as the company has revealed this year's flagship. OnePlus is nothing short of a household name in India, where its phones are received with great enthusiasm. This year's flagship by OnePlus, with all its upgrades, gives fans more reasons to consider an upgrade. But the real question is whether you should give in to your temptations? OnePlus 10 Pro starts at Rs 66,999 for the 8GB+128GB model whereas the 12GB+256GB variant costs Rs 71,999. There's an offer with SBI cards, where customers can avail Rs 4,500 instant discount among host of other offers. OnePlus 10 Pro goes on sale starting April 5 in India. Now, let's take a deeper dive into what the 10 Pro is made of and what it is truly capable of. This is a review of the OnePlus flagship after using the device for a week. Design and form-factor The phone's design is the first thing anyone notices and that first impression makes or breaks the intention to buy the phone. OnePlus has remained consistent in its efforts to deliver one of the best-looking premium smartphones, which has appealed to the masses. Now, with the OnePlus 10 Pro, the streak continues. In fact, it is distinctly different from the previous generation, thanks to the remodelled camera module, giving reasons for OnePlus 9 series users to give the 10 Pro some serious thought. OnePlus 10 Pro has a frosted glass back, which has a nice smooth feel. The rear panel is disrupted by the relatively large camera module, which merges into the phone's aluminium frame. The Hasselblad branding along the side is a nice touch. The module looks like it's part of both the glass panel and the chassis. OnePlus' bold makeover is well-lauded and a refreshing change, which grabs a lot of attention. It's worth pointing out that the camera module has a ceramic cover, which looks just as premium and effortlessly keeps scratches at bay. It's a much-needed feature considering there's more area prone to scratches than before. The weight distribution of the phone is one other important factor. OnePlus has done a good job in that space, which makes handling the phone easier. Despite tipping the scales at 201 grams and measuring 8.55mm thick, the 10 Pro feels light and sleek when held. OnePlus 10 Pro comes in Volcanic Black and Emerald Green, the latter being our review unit as you can see from the product shots. It's a beautiful shade with a touch of elegance. This shade perfectly conceals any fingerprint smudges, not once did we have to clean the rear panel. The only area that required cleaning was the camera module and the lenses, but it wasn't too evident. OnePlus has once again nailed the design. The 10 Pro looks premium, feels just as great. For anyone looking to get a refreshing flagship look, the 10 Pro checks all the boxes. Display and usability OnePlus 10 Pro's display is another winner. The 6.7-inch screen curves towards the edges to give an edge-to-edge feel. The punch-hole camera takes the top-left corner position, which is no longer a disruption given how frequent it has become. The front glass is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass Victus, which adds some durability but don't go on drop-testing your new phone. Impressively, the display is an LTPO AMOLED panel, which in layman's terms means the refresh rate is adjusted based on the content you're viewing in real-time. It can go from as low as 1Hz and as high as 120Hz. The tall displays are becoming a norm in premium phones, which is particularly useful in tasks like viewing multimedia or playing games. In landscape mode, sliding fingers across the screen leaves hardly any dead spots. Another noticeable difference OnePlus has made in terms of convenience is moving up the fingerprint sensor, which now perfectly aligns with the position of your thumb while holding the phone in one hand. OnePlus says this was done after thorough research and feedback. We can vouch for its effective execution. So, kudos! As for the output, the 10 Pro's display is as good as things get. The colours are punchy and vivid and the brightness is generously sufficient to be used even under bright summer sunlight. The auto-brightness setting also seemed to work accurately, as it adjusted the brightness based on ambient lighting. There's also Nature tone display feature, which adjusts colour temperature according to ambient lighting, but we left it turned off. The dark mode with enhanced style was the best choice as the deep blacks gave a nice visual appeal. After playing around with the screen colour modes, we found the Cinematic mode under Pro setting ideal. But you can always find the best setting based on your liking. Camera and new modes Clearly, the OnePlus 10 Pro's revamped camera module is indicative of the fact that the company has spent extra hours on perfecting the optics. Taking some help from Hasselblad and reliable sensors, OnePlus aims to gain some weightage in the camera department, an area that has been challenging for the maker. With the 10 Pro, OnePlus has done some tweaks here and there, let's see if it has yielded any positive outcome. Let's start with the specs. OnePlus 10 Pro has a triple camera setup, the fourth ring at the back is a dual-LED flash. The phone has a 48MP primary sensor with f/1.8 OIS, a 50MP ultra-wide secondary lens with 0.64μm, f/2.2 and an 8MP telephoto f/2.4, OIS, 3.3x sensor. On the front is a 32MP selfie snapper. OnePlus-Hasselblad association is still in its early stages. But its use case cannot be ignored completely. For instance, the iconic shutter button, the Pro mode and new filters from Hasselblad Master Styles, show their association. But there's more work for the sensors than Hasselblad from what we've gathered. Some of the early shots of OnePlus 10 Pro in different modes have shown the cameras deliver a decent output. The low-light shots are exceptionally good, the main sensor captures good details with vividness. The ultra-wide and 150-degree mode bring a fresh perspective to shooting images, but not as much as the Xpan did when it was introduced. Shot on OnePlus 10 Pro: Observations: Performance and software OnePlus is known to never compromise on performance. The 10 Pro is powered by Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, the best processor there is for smartphones. Paired with 8GB or 12GB RAM, the configuration is ideal for any tasks you throw at the phone. OnePlus 10 Pro also lets you increase RAM capacity by 3GB, 5GB or 7GB, which will be borrowed from the storage. This will give a boost to the performance. The first update arrived for the 10 Pro, fixing several bugs we encountered early on. Like the camera app would force close or go unresponsive even after mild use. This was fixed by the update, and we haven't had the issue again so far. With Jim 4G and ACT Fibernet at home, the OnePlus 10 Pro had good range and connectivity throughout. The gaming experience was uninterrupted. The performance was unparalleled during gaming, but we did notice mild heating when we played games while the phone was on charge. But OnePlus seems to have handled heat dissipation well on the 10 Pro, courtesy of its 5-layer 3D Passive Cooling System. OnePlus 10 Pro is still going to be our go-to phone for gaming.  The fingerprint scanner worked accurately with good success rate. OnePlus 10 Pro delivers what is expected of it in terms of performance, but so do other flagship phones, which can be a reason for worry for OnePlus' ""never settle"" spirit. The UI optimisation is fine-tuned well, the settings and customisations let you go far and beyond. But we must mention the new wallpapers look incredibly cool. The smooth animation paired with that beautiful display make the wallpapers come to life. You must really check them out. OnePlus has added some special features. We found the OnePlus Shelf and Quick Launch to be of great use during our review. Battery and charging superpowers The battery makes up for a big part of OnePlus 10 Pro. There's a 5,000mAh unit inside. It is powered by 80W SuperVOOC fast charging, but OnePlus has switched back to USB-Type A on the adapter, a move the company says was the accommodate the faster-charging capability. We'd still have loved to have the Type-C simply for its convenience. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, paired with LTPO display and the huge size of the battery seems like a fine combination to keep the phone running for a full-day. With low to moderate use, the 10 Pro can last up to two days, but with heavy use, you'll need to plug the phone in for charging towards the end of the day. OnePlus 10 Pro can fully charge in just 30-35 minutes, which is a nice feature to have. But even if you plug the phone in for 20 minutes, we were able to use the phone for a whole day. OnePlus 10 Pro also supports 50W wireless fast charging, which came in handy while working. It would take about an hour to fully charge the 10 Pro wirelessly. The fast charging feature makes up for any shortage in battery life. Often, it would be helpful during gaming or binge-watching sessions. Verdict OnePlus 10 Pro is indeed a well-rounded flagship, but the severity of the competition in the premium segment doesn't make it easy for OnePlus to walk away with the title of ""flagship killer"" anymore. Fans who've grown to love and admire OnePlus over the years will find the 10 Pro extremely compelling. The phone has a lovely, premium design, great performance, good cameras overall, beautiful display and some nice add-ons if you dive deeper. For its price, OnePlus 10 Pro is not without competition.

243,2022-03-25,08:00:00,technology,smartphones,iPhone 13 Pro review: New camera powerhouse; no-compromise flagship," Apple's valuation recently hit a staggering $3 trillion market cap, and the company didn't get to where it is by being ordinary. It's been 15 years since Steve Jobs unveiled the iPhone, changing the prospect of phones forever. Year after year, Apple has thrived to deliver excellence and has remained committed to the premium nature of its phones. Between now and 2007, iPhone's evolution is quite evident, but if you stack up all the iPhones side by side, you'll notice the biggest upgrades were not quite frequent. Nevertheless, Apple finds a way to impress its fans and the iPhone 13 Pro is a stunner. We have been using the iPhone 13 Pro as the daily driver and we now fully understand what makes or breaks the new Apple flagship. If you're still confused about whether or not iPhone 13 Pro is the way to go, this review will answer all your questions. Biggest takeaways in one minute Apple iPhone 13 Pro is the best camera phone you can buy, living up to its Pro moniker in every sense. The ProRes video, Photographic Styles and portraits are just stunning. But the iPhone 13 Pro's prowess doesn't end there. There's a brilliant display with a higher refresh rate now, an excellent battery life (yes, in the non-Max model, I say), a much compact in-hand feel, and unparalleled performance (gamers, you there?). For someone who hasn't used a Pro model in past, the iPhone 13 Pro might feel heavy, but it grows on you. The notch is still there, which isn't very 2021 or even 2022-like. But September is not too far off, or is it? We just have to wait and watch. We just hope by then, Apple leads in the battery compartment, the charging speed to be specific. All in all, iPhone 13 Pro is for hardcore users, who think they will push the limits on the camera front and battery stress. Now, let's dive in for a deeper analysis of the points we've just made and why we made them. Design iPhone 13 Pro takes a lot of inspiration from its predecessor, gets that classy glass sandwich design. The stainless steel chassis handles scratches like a pro, and it also manages to keep those smudges at bay. The glass back has shimmering silver that gives away a milky hue, which is in the case of our Silver review unit. But there are Sierra Blue, Gold and Graphite colours to choose from, which ever suits your taste. The Silver variant, however, has an elegant look, and you cannot go wrong with it. On the back panel, the camera module stands out. The camera sensors are evidently larger, which makes it wobble on a flat surface, but you can just slap a case on it and fix it. On the other side, the display is bezel-less with the disruption of a notch, albeit a smaller one. While it is nice to see Apple try and shrink the size of the notch, it didn't really achieve much by gaining the 20 percent extra screen real-estate. Maybe the iPhone 14 Pro might change that. Overall, the iPhone 13 Pro is easy to handle, but more than that it is still an eye-candy. The iPhone 13 Pro is not in the foldable league, but as far as the flat phones go, it is the best you got. Display Now, this is where things get exciting. The iPhone 13 Pro's display is fantastic, with all the goodness of 120Hz LTPO adaptive refresh rate OLED panel. The already-smooth display just got smoother, the animations are fine-tuned, even inside the menus and supported apps. The display's full capabilities are not completely utilised until the games are capable of running 120fps. Now, for your day-to-day use, the iPhone 13 Pro's display is stunning. The colours are rich, come to life and the peak brightness will get you through a sunny day and finally consuming multimedia in HDR is fulfilling. Camera The biggest upgrade in this year's iPhones has to be the camera setup. The iPhone 13 Pro manages to once again outperform its competition on various spectrums. With faster focus, better low-light performance, crisp details and vivid subjects, the iPhone 13 Pro can give you the photos you desire from a ""pro"" grade camera flagship. Apple retains video-recording proficiency and it can do so with so much ease now. The ProRAW lets you capture RAW files on a phone, making it that much easier for cinematographers to get the post-editing done. If you're looking for a phone that shoots videos like a pro, look no further. But Apple's prowess doesn't end there. In the photos, the iPhone 13 Pro has managed to excel and the difference is night and day compared to the iPhone 12 Pro. The primary lens is evidently larger and the faster f/1.5 aperture allows more light than ever to give you great photos even in challenging lighting conditions. The telephoto lens, too, has a new sensor and a 3x optical zoom, which is even supported by Night Mode to get some kickass shots. Overall, the low-light performance on the iPhone 13 Pro is impressive. Shooting in daylight is as good as ever. The details are retained, colours are accurate, great skin tones in most light conditions and backlit scenes, and the results are reliable whether you're shooting indoors or outdoors. The ultra-wide-angle lens captures pretty great shots, but for the first time, it also doubles up as a macro lens for you to get those truly close-up shots. Macro also works at 1x, you just have to get as close as 1-inch to the subject. Apple hasn't done it in the past, but it doesn't feel like this is Apple's first stint. The macro mode works as intended, captures good details and retains true colours. The new camera mode came in handy at times when we needed to add a new perspective to the subjects. But the ultra-wide lens doesn't lose its charm while trying to impress with macro. The iPhone 13 Pro still has the best wide-angle shots, and more so now that it can manage pretty fantastic results in low lighting. Even the portraits are as good as ever. The accurate edge detection and depth of field effect brings out the subjects, which are sharper, crisper and vivid. More than the actual sensors, Apple did spice things up with some extras. The Cinematic Mode on the iPhone 13 Pro is a fun feature to use and it just goes on to show what the future looks like for mobile photography. The Cinematic mode racks focus from one subject to another with an impressive dramatic effect. Surely, the new camera feature needs improvements in certain scenarios, but we really like where this is going and it's only going to get better from here. The Cinematic mode doesn't replace your regular videos but lets you experiment with something new, something you haven't on a phone. The new iPhone camera also offers Photographic Styles, which is something you'll truly admire. You can choose your look and go about shooting your subjects. From Standard to Rich Contrast or warm to cool, you choose your pick based on what you're shooting and get the results you want without having to go back to the photo for post-processing. Shot on iPhone 13 Pro: Camera samples Performance and iOS The iPhone 13 Pro is powered by the A15 Bionic, which is way better than what the competition has to offer. In our day-to-day use, the processor didn't even break a sweat. Even with heavy tasks like gaming or editing videos or shooting them, the A15 Bionic held its ground. You can be running multiple apps and going back and forth, none of it will slow down the phone. But on some rare occasions, we did notice the iPhone freeze on us during an incoming call. But after the last software update to iOS 15.2, we did not face any such issues. Speaking of iOS, the software still commands a prominent presence. Apple has made several changes to enhance the user experience with its iOS 15 while retaining the bigger picture as is. There are a plethora of features just waiting to be tested. The Live Text feature is a life-saver and we found it to be of great use in our day-to-day tasks. Safari went through a major change by putting the tabs at the bottom, which after getting used to, we found it to be quite intuitive. Every time you get on a video call using WhatsApp or FaceTime, you get to choose portrait mode to give that bokeh effect. But what we found really interesting is how well Apple cleaned up the notifications with Notification Summary. It's like Jarvis reading out my important dailies. The iPhone 13 Pro naturally got all the other basics right. The call quality, 4G browsing, Wi-Fi 6 speeds work flawlessly. The dual stereo speaker is loud and has detail and depth. FaceID is still the best biometric solution out there and works like a charm every single time. Even with a face mask, if you have your Apple Watch paired, the iPhone unlocks in an instant. Apple's true magic is how tightly knit its devices are when on the same Apple ID. In our case, the iPhone 13 Pro, AirPods, MacBook were on the same Apple ID and how well they all linked to each other is one of the main reasons to join the iOS bandwagon. We could be listening to music, answer a call from the watch and it goes straight to AirPods. Or, you copy something on your iPhone and go to your Mac and paste it and voila! It is little things like these that truly add up to the grand scheme of things. But the high walled garden that is iOS is still not as open as Android. But that just depends on how much of that freedom is truly relevant to you. In our case, it barely mattered. Battery Apple iPhones have come a long way in the battery department. The iPhone 13 Pro can easily last a whole day between charges, but if the battery is where your priorities lie then the iPhone 13 Pro Max is where you should be looking. With an average screen time of 7.3 hours, the iPhone 13 Pro easily got us through the day. Considering what the phone's packing, we'd say it is a fair offering and we weren't disappointed at all. The iPhone 13 Pro doesn't come with a USB-C charger, instead, it just comes with a new cable. If you want to take advantage of fast charging, you might want to pick up a new 27W adaptor. In terms of battery charging speeds, there are phones that charge way faster. It is one area where Apple truly needs to step up its game. Requiring nearly two hours to fully charge the iPhone 13 Pro shouldn't be the case if there are phones capable of fully charging in under 15-20 minutes. Until Apple comes around, the faster adaptor is a sound investment. Verdict Apple iPhone 13 Pro checks all the right boxes for a premium flagship smartphone, but is this the phone you need to buy? It's worth pointing out that the iPhone 13 Pro is pricey, starts at Rs 1,19,900 and it keeps going up with the storage. But if the price is no concern, the iPhone 13 Pro is a solid option. The iPhone 13 Pro promises a great camera, excellent performance, vivid screen with 120Hz refresh rate, stunningly premium design, a compact body, and reliable battery life. But if the battery is higher up on your list, the iPhone 13 Pro Max is right up your alley. But that would be at the cost of a larger size phone to handle day in and day out. Now, if you're not really an avid user who wouldn't be pushing the limits on the performance or the camera for that matter, consider the less pricey option of iPhone 13, which is still a solid purchase. The Pro model is recommended for those who demand more; a lot more than an average user who just likes to go about the day and wind down with a few TV shows or music.","

When Apple launched the iPhone SE in 2020, there was much excitement and reception for the smartphone, which was touted as the cheapest, yet most powerful iPhone at the time. Carrying the legacy forward, the new iPhone SE is both exciting and meh! Meet the new iPhone SE Ever since Apple (sort of) killed the Touch ID, we've been eagerly waiting to see the next render of the biometric sensor. Of course, the Face ID is the best facial recognition tech out there, but everyone misses the convenience of the Touch ID. Well, thanks for keeping it alive, albeit in just one of its iPhones. Apple's all-new iPhone SE is once again the cheapest yet most powerful iPhone to date. It has an A15 Bionic chip - the same one that powers the entire iPhone lineup from last fall. It's interesting to see how Apple doesn't compromise on the performance aspect even as it chooses to cut some corners here and there to accommodate a lower price tag. Even so, the iPhone SE will still make sense to a whole lot of people out there. First off, the iPhone SE will be available for pre-order on Friday, March 11 with availability beginning Friday, March 18. iPhone SE comes in 64GB, 128GB and 256GB models with midnight, starlight, and (PRODUCT)RED shades to choose from. The iPhone SE is priced starting at Rs 43,900, which is only a slight increase compared to the original iPhone SE's launch price. iPhone SE has been an incredibly popular choice with our existing users and for new iPhone customers, thanks to its iconic design, exceptional performance, and affordable price. This year we've built the most powerful and durable iPhone SE yet, with better battery life thanks to A15 Bionic, the same chip as our iPhone 13 lineup that also unlocks advanced camera features like Smart HDR 4, Photographic Styles, and Deep Fusion. And with 5G, iPhone SE gives users faster downloads and uploads, higher quality video streaming, real-time interactivity in apps, and much more. Delivering the latest generation of technology and performance at this price is something only Apple can do,"" said Kaiann Drance, Apple's vice president of Worldwide iPhone Product Marketing, covering all the main aspects of the iPhone SE. Here's a quick run-down of the specs of the all-new iPhone SE One more thing... The elegant surprise we spoke of earlier had nothing to do with iPhone SE and everything to do with iPhone 13 Pro, iPhone 13 Pro Max and iPhone 13. Well, the iPhone flagships will be available in new shades of green, besides the existing sierra blue, graphite, gold, and silver hues. The iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max get a premium paint job in the name of alpine green and the new shade looks absolutely stunning. The alpine green will undoubtedly be in high demand and safe to say the new industry trend. The iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max will be available in the new alpine green in 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB storage options starting at Rs 1,19,900 and Rs 1,29,900 respectively.  As for the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini, they come in a green shade. The difference is not quite evident, except for the premium touches given to the Pro models. The iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini will be available in the new green in 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB storage options, starting at Rs 79,900 and Rs 69,900 respectively. These new colors give customers even more options when choosing their iPhone, and we can't wait for them to take advantage of all the iPhone 13 lineup offers, including unmatched performance with A15 Bionic, our best camera systems, massive improvements to battery life for everyday needs, fast 5G, incredible durability, and so much more,"" said Bob Borchers, Apple's vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing.","

246,2022-03-08,16:29:13,technology,smartphones,Vivo V23 review: iPhone-esque design for Android fans; there's more," Vivo has been making a lot of splash with its frequent smartphone launches, to keep its consumers excited with each one. The Vivo V23 surely came as a bundle of joy. Priced comfortably in the Rs 30,000 range, the V23 is placed in a highly-competitive category. Does it have what it takes to take on its rivals? Let's find out. Vivo V23 is priced at Rs 29,990 (8GB+128GB) and Rs 34,990 (12GB+256GB). For the price, it offers a sleek-looking body with great design, capable cameras and features that will lock you in. But it's not completely devoid of flaws as the price point may demand more from the phone in certain areas. Design and display Vivo V23 is easily one of the best looking mid-range phones you can get. The iPhone-esque design elements are hard to miss, but Vivo has thrown in its signature look here and there. The phone is extremely sleek, measuring just 7.55mm, and it can be easily handled. Both the in-hand feel and the looks of the Vivo V23 are premium, giving the impression of a flagship phone. The flat chassis has a matte finish, and has a continuation of the body's colour tone. Our review unit, the Stardust Black, is supremely elegant. The rear panel has a fluorite AG glass design, which shimmers with every ray of sunlight that befalls it. On top of the glass back panel, there's a metal module housing the triple camera setup, which doesn't bulge much to tip-toe on the desk when placed. The rest of the phone is pretty standard, everything from USB Type-C port, speaker grille and SIM card slot at the bottom and the power and volume controls on the right side. Before you get your hopes high, it's worth noting that the phone lacks stereo speakers, so it's best to adjust your expectations. Moving on to the next big element - the display. Vivo V23 has a 6.44-inch 10-bit AMOLED display with HDR10+ certification and 90Hz refresh rate. The display's edge-to-edge finish is disrupted by a rather big notch, which is understandable considering the camera setup it houses. If you're willing to forgo that, the display itself is quite great for consumption of multimedia content and gaming. The panel is bright enough to be used outdoors without any issues. The colour reproduction is accurate, and the 90Hz refresh rate was acceptable choice. Camera Vivo V23 is touted as a camera phone and the company has evidently focused a lot on it. More than the rear camera setup, the front camera setup is of particular interest. It's rare that we say so. The front cameras are equipped with 50MP primary sensor paired with an 8MP ultra-wide angle lens. On the rear, there's a 64MP primary camera paired with an 8MP ultra-wide and 2MP macro sensors. If selfies are truly important aspect of your phone, the V23 won't disappoint you. The front camera lets you switch to an ultra-wide mode to capture a wider frame, useful in cases of group selfies. As for the primary sensor, the pictures taken are detailed and have natural tones. There's soft smoothening applied to photos, which are to make selfies look more appealing (at least to some people's liking). Even so, the selfie camera on the V23 is the arguably one of the best you'll find in the market. The front camera also has eye-tracking AF, which will be useful in case of vlogging. The front camera setup appears to have taken up Vivo's interest, so much so that the rear camera setup comes off as slightly underwhelming. The primary sensor does a fairly good job as compared to the wide-angle sensor, where the colour shift is quite evident even while shooting the same scene. Keeping the focus to the 64MP sensor, the colours were saturated, dynamic range and exposure well balanced and the details rightly retained - all under well-lit scenes. In the night mode, the V23 manages to get decent results, contrary to the ""exceptional"" claims. All in all, stick to the primary sensors and you'll be fine. Check out the camera samples below: Performance Vivo V23 is poerend by Dimensity 920 chipset, which may come across as a poor choice for many performance-driven users. But if you're an average user, a bit of camera and games, the usual multimedia, social media and communications, the V23 should be capable enough. Again, people who demand more through high graphics gaming are right to feel there are better alternatives out there. Vivo V23's fingerprint sensor under the display works accurately and efficiently. The speaker works better if you're indoors, rather than in a public or a crowded place. Finally, the FunTouchOS software V23 runs on is based on Android 12, which is a hit and miss affair, most a hit. The software has underwent some serious fine-tuning, making day to day use easy. The aesthetic appeal of the UI grows on you and everything is kept simple. There are ample animations and customisations to explore from and the nifty features like app locker, call recorder, Always-on display, dark mode and more are welcoming. The annoying aspects remain. The FunTouchOS still lives with the burden of bloatware, but it's organised away from your sight. The notifications from unused, pre-installed, on the other hand, can be annoying, unless you turn them off. We tested the Vivo V23 with Vodafone 4G in Bengaluru and did not notice any major issues with regards to connectivity or browsing on mobile data. Even the Wi-Fi on ACT network worked as expected. Battery Vivo V23 is powered by a 4,200mAh battery. Clearly the medium sized battery is a result of the sleek form-factor. On mobile data + GPS at 90Hz refresh rate, the V23 is not the best phone in battery life test. With OTT streaming, a bit a gaming besides the regular use of the phone, the V23 struggles to survive the day. But the only good thing is that the V23 is supported by 44W fast charging, which can juice up the phone in less than an hour. Verdict Vivo V23 is an average smartphone with some notable highlights. The overall design of the phone really stayed with us, while the front camera and the display are on the good side of things. The V23 could use improvements in areas of performance and battery. But if you're not a demanding user, who occasionally uses the phone for extensive gaming and regular multimedia streaming, the V23 is a good phone for day-to-day use.","

249,2022-02-16,18:47:34,technology,smartphones,Shot on iPhone: 60 photos show iPhone 13 Pro's camera capability in real world [Slideshow]," We have heard and talked much about the iPhone 13 Pro's cameras. The all-new triple camera setup might look the same as on its predecessor, but there's so much more to explore - thanks to the improved sensors. iPhone 13 Pro and the iPhone 13 Pro Max sport triple camera setup, featuring a 77mm telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom, an ultra-wide camera with ƒ/1.8 aperture and a wide camera with ƒ/1.5 aperture. These new sensors are significantly improved in low-light performance and it's evident from the photos we've captured using the iPhone 13 Pro. The new Wide camera has 1.9 µm pixels and f/1.5 aperture and it ensured there's lesser, in some cases none, noise. To top it all off is the celebrated sensor-shift OIS, which is a boon for those who use the iPhone for video recording. Now, the Ultra-Wide camera, which has an f/1.8 aperture, allows more light and improves low-light performance. And finally, the 77mm telephoto camera with its 3x optical zoom makes sure you get great shots from a distance. It works on portrait mode as well as macro, and you'll only learn its benefit in real-world scenarios. All three sensors combined, the iPhone 13 Pro easily has the best camera setup. In order to give you a taste of what the iPhone 13 Pro camera is truly capable of, check out the 60 photos we've captured using Apple's latest flagship.  Photo Gallery: Slideshow We observed the iPhone 13 Pro's impressive capabilities to reduce noise in low-light shots and even add richer tones and natural colours. Even in extremely low light conditions, one portrait shot by the beach in Goa managed to capture excellent details without any noise. The same result from iPhone 12 Pro Max showed just how improved the 13 Pro cameras are. In low-lights, the blacks are maintained at dark tones, that too without noise. In case of wide-angle shots, low-light results were not the best, but managed to deliver decent images. ","

250,2022-02-13,10:41:00,technology,smartphones,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G review: Appealing phone for a price," Samsung Galaxy S21 FE is the newly-added member to the company's flagship lineup. Building on the success of the Fan Edition models, Samsung has brought yet another flagship-grade smartphone - succeeding the extremely popular Galaxy S20 FE. It comes as no surprise that Samsung would continue the FE series as a follow-up, and it's here, right on time. Samsung launched the Galaxy S21 FE in two configurations, with 128GB and 256GB storage options, priced at Rs 54,999 and Rs 58,999, respectively. The pricing of the phone is where people's concerns lie, especially when the competition in the market is so aggressive. So, is the Galaxy S21 FE's price justified? Let's find out. As we noted in our first impressions, the offers a premium flagship experience, smooth end-user experience topped with brand value and long-term software support. Let's dive deeper into the smartphone's core aspects to see if it makes the cut for you. Design and display Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G draws inspiration from the Galaxy S21, especially on the camera setup, which now gets a contour-cut module. Shifting away from the glass sandwich design, the S21 FE has a plastic back and the camera module is plastic, too, which is unlike the metal base on the flagship models. The black hue appears matte, and we are guessing it is by design given the colour is called Graphite. However, a deeper black would have appeared nice on the back panel. There are three other colours to choose from, which appear more premium. The advantage of the plastic back is that it is durable and less prone to damage if dropped. After using the smartphone for a while, we noticed it is lighter than most phones in its range, making it handy and less tiresome. After all, it weighs 177 grams and at 7.9mm, it gets really easy to use with a single hand. Speaking of shedding extra weight, Samsung has gone with minimal packaging for the S21 FE, much like its flagship series. The biggest change you'll notice is the missing charger in the box. As for the display, we had no complaints. It's a bright and vibrant 6.4-inch AMOLED FHD+ panel on the S21 FE, which additionally bags 120Hz refresh rate. The Corning Gorilla Glass Victus seem to be doing its job well at keeping minor scratches at bay. The panel curves around the edges ever so slightly, you'll barely notice, but it gives an edge-to-edge feel. Consuming multimedia, browsing the Internet and social media, or simply going through your chats is as seamless as it can be on the vivid display. Samsung has expertise in this field and is not hesitant to show it off. Overall, the Galaxy S21 FE is easy on hands and the display is beautiful for almost any use case. If you're going to slap a back case on the phone, we wouldn't worry much about the dull finish in the black model. Camera Samsung Galaxy S21 FE packs a triple rear camera setup, combining a 12MP main sensor with f/1.8 aperture, a 12MP ultra-wide sensor and an 8MP telephoto lens with 3X optical zoom. Samsung isn't going overboard with the megapixels, but you'll notice the phone is more than capable to handle your camera needs. It's not a huge step-up from what we saw in the S20 FE as results produced are nearly identical. Samsung Galaxy S21 FE manages to produce good results in broad daylight. The images are vibrant, rich and detailed with balanced saturation. The main camera's auto focus worked pretty well in getting the subject in focus. The portrait shots are equally good, with solid depth effect you can expect from a flagship phone. Switching to ultra-wide downgraded some level of quality, especially in the details. But the wide mode was well used in giving dramatic effect to photos, as you'll see in our camera samples below. Low-light photography remains a touchy subject. The night mode did in fact perform well, given certain situations, but the level of retaining natural colours was amiss. The night mode did, however, brighten the image and did some noise correction to make the result acceptable. What we really liked is that Night mode is supported on the ultra-wide sensor too, which turned out to be more useful than we imagined. The Galaxy S21 FE has the same zooming capabilities as its predecessor and the results are also too similar. On the front is a 32MP selfie camera, which manages to capture good details and natural colours in daylight setting, but the quality suffers in dim-lit areas. The portrait mode on the front camera is accurate. You can also change the background effect on the portraits, which we found pretty cool as some filters were natural and some looked bad. But you can always stick with the good ones to give your images a unique spin. Check out some camera samples below: Performance and UI This is where things get really exciting. The Galaxy S21 FE comes with flagship Exynos 2100 chipset, which is the same one powering the S21 series. The chipset is a known performer and does an excellent job running things in the Galaxy S21 FE. Besides performance, the chipset unlocks some premium features like wireless Dex mode to share content to a larger screen and use it like a PC. The supported 5G bands will make sure you are future-proof with this phone, although it seems like a long road down till India gets 5G network. As expected, the phone has Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5 and NFC for Samsung Pay. While many OEMs are still on Android 11, Samsung has upgraded the Galaxy S21 FE to Android 12-based OneUI 4.0. The software is far from stock Android, but works pretty well and gives a familiar user experience. The gestures and navigations worked pretty well. We tested the phone on various fronts and it seem to know its way around most. Multimedia consumption was great, thanks to HDR 10 playback. High graphics gaming exceeded our expectations, especially with the smooth refresh rate and unwavering frame rates. The way Samsung packaged this device, lightweight and performance-heavy, we found it quite appealing in our gaming and movie marathons. The stereos worked perfectly well indoors, be it for gaming or multimedia, but we recommend using compatible earphones when stepping out. Despite the plastic back, the S21 FE support wireless charging and it is also IP68 rated for dust and water resistance. We didn't quite rely on the former, but the latter did come in handy on many occasions. If we have to assess the Galaxy S21 FE by its performance, it is easily worth recommending. Battery Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G is powered by a 4,500mAh battery, which is same as its predecessor. For most users, this phone will easily get you through the day, with mixed use of calls, social media, photos and gaming. With increased gaming or multimedia streaming, you'll notice the battery bars drop sooner. If you're planning to catch up on your TV shows while on the road, it might be smart to carry a power bank. But if we get down to charging speeds, there are a lot faster charging phones out there. Since the S21 FE doesn't come with a power adaptor, you will have to use what you got or buy a new one. In any case, even the fastest 65W adaptor won't translate to faster charging as it would take a little over an hour to fully power up the phone. Verdict Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G has many things going its way. Like the design is definitely better in terms of durability and usability. It's got an IP68 rating and wireless charging support. The display is simply fantastic for all use cases and the performance of the phone is at par with most flagships. The areas it could have been better is battery, limited storage, and the lack of a charging brick. But above all, it is the pricing of the S21 FE that makes it truly compelling as it is priced so close to the Galaxy S21 and higher if we take competition into consideration. Samsung is running a discount of Rs 5,000 at the moment with HDFC Bank cards. But if you look at Amazon.in, the price difference between 128GB version of Galaxy S21 and S21 FE is merely Rs 1,000. If you're really looking into value-buying, consider the Galaxy S20 FE, which is going for Rs 39,990. With a generous price cut on the Galaxy S21 FE 5G, it would be more appealing.","

251,2022-02-10,00:51:41,technology,smartphones,This is how Samsung rewrote smartphone history in last decade," As Samsung geared up to showcase its flagship Galaxy S22 series, the company on Wednesday shared how it has consistently been setting the bar for the industry with its latest models unveiled at every Unpacked event, and this year is going to be no different. Samsung said in a statement that it has been leading the industry by introducing hardware (HW) and software (SW) that break the existing mold every year for the past 12 years since the unveiling of the first Galaxy S device in 2010. ""Some of the most game-changing so far include a large-screen smartphone with excellent immersion; a smartphone-stylus combination that enhanced productivity and creativity; and the world's first dual-pixel camera technology,"" said the South Korean major. Samsung kicked off the trend of the large screen era in the smartphone industry with the introduction of their AMOLED display. This display, developed using Active Matrix Organic Light Emitting Diode (AMOLED) technology, is characterised by its clear picture quality, self-luminescence and larger screen size. The Samsung Galaxy S was the world's first smartphone to be launched with a Super AMOLED display, an ultra-thin screen that consumes less power and provides crisper and more vivid picture quality. Samsung has continued to take its AMOLED technology to the next level by unveiling devices with more powerful and more advanced screens. With the introduction of the Galaxy Note equipped with S Pen, it is now possible to save and share everything from memos to drawings right on our smartphone's screen. In 2011, the Galaxy Note was launched with an S Pen that supported 256 levels of pressure onto the device's large screen. Since then, both the Note and the S Pen have become inseparable, and as the series has developed, both have evolved significantly. Samsung Knox, installed on Galaxy devices since the Galaxy Note 3 in 2013, protects devices on a step-by-step basis from the chipset to the operating system (OS) and application level, while also blocking hacking and unauthorized access. In 2021, the company launched Samsung Knox Vault with the Galaxy S21 in order to thoroughly ensure the protection of ever-growing amounts of data. Samsung expanded the horizon of smartphone experiences by applying waterproof and dustproof functions to the Galaxy S5 for the first time in 2014. The IP68 rating is given to devices after testing in fresh water at a depth of 1.5m for 30 minutes. The company introduced Samsung Pay, a mobile payment service that replaces the cash and credit cards in a user's wallet, on the Galaxy S6 in 2015. In 2016, Samsung raised the smartphone camera function to a new level by installing the industry's first dual pixel in the Galaxy S7. ""At that time, the dual pixel was an image sensor only seen in high-end digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) cameras. By increasing the amount of light received by both the front and rear cameras, the Galaxy S7 was able to focus quickly and accurately, as well as take optimal photos in dark environments,"" said Samsung. One UI is an interface that supports the unique user experience of Samsung Galaxy, and was first introduced in November 2018. Updated last year, it harnesses a completely different colour palette with which to decorate a device's home screen, icons, notifications and wallpapers. In 2019, Samsung pioneered the field of foldable smartphones by unveiling the world's first Galaxy Z Fold, equipped with a 7.3-inch Infinity Flex Display. Samsung not only pioneered a new form factor, but also new usability options through such functions as Flex mode, which allows for more usage scenarios by fixing the hinge at a specific angle, and Multi-Active Window, which can open and run apps at the same time with applications optimized for the foldable screen for a split screen view. Last year, the company introduced the Object Eraser feature that lets you remove any unwanted objects in your photos with just a touch. The Object Eraser function, first introduced in the Galaxy S21, is a photo editing tool that harnesses artificial intelligence. (With inputs from IANS)","

252,2022-02-10,00:42:43,technology,smartphones,Samsung Galaxy S22 series redefine premium experience; S22 Ultra steals the show [details]," Setting a new benchmark for premium smartphones, Samsung Electronics on Wednesday unveiled its flagship Galaxy S22 series, along with the top-end S22 Ultra device that merges the power of Galaxy Note and the pro-grade camera and performance of the 'S' series -- with a built-in Stylus (S) Pen, advanced video capabilities and battery life that can last over a day. The company also introduced Galaxy S22 and S22+ devices with dynamic cameras and advanced intelligent image processing, among other features. Galaxy S22 Ultra with an immersive 6.8-inch, Dynamic AMOLED 2X display and a 5,000mAh battery housing Android 12 and One UI 4.0 will be available from February 25 in select markets in Phantom Black, Phantom White, Green, and Burgundy colours in 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB models with 8GB and 12GB RAM. Galaxy S22 (6.1-inch) and Galaxy S22+ (6.6-inch) will also be available from February 25 in Phantom Black, Phantom White, Green, and Pink Gold finishes in 128GB and 256GB models with 8GB RAM. ""Galaxy S22 Ultra takes the beloved functionality of the Galaxy Note and the most celebrated aspects of the S series and merges them for a truly unique mobile experience,"" said TM Roh, President and Head of Samsung Electronics' MX (Mobile eXperience) Business. For the first time ever, Note users' favourite built-in S Pen is coming to an S series device. ""With 70 per cent lower latency, you can write and draw more naturally on your S22 Ultra's expansive screen, and explore apps in new ways,"" said the company. Samsung said that the Advanced Nightography feature is now available on the entire S22 family of devices that will allow users to snap crisp, clear videos on both the front and back cameras, whether during the day or night. The Galaxy S22 Ultra is built with a 2.4um pixel sensor -- Samsung's largest pixel sensor ever, enabling its camera lenses to capture more light and data, optimising the lighting and detail of video clips. At the rear, it offers a 12MP ultra-wide camera, a 108 MP wide camera, a 10MP telephoto camera (3x optical zoom) and a 10MP telephoto camera (10x optical zoom). The device sports a 40MP front camera for selfies, offering advanced Super Clear Glass lens and video Auto Framing tools. ""Like Galaxy S22 and S22+, Galaxy S22 Ultra offers exclusive access to the Expert RAW app, which features a comprehensive suite of in-camera editing tools that deliver a DSLR-like experience and let you enjoy more creative control,"" said Samsung. The 100X Space Zoom on the device includes 10x Optical Zoom and 10x digital zoom with AI Super Resolution technology. S22 Ultra also supports 45W super-fast charging, so you can record more than 50 minutes of video after a 10-minute charge, the company claimed. Meanwhile, both Galaxy S22 and S22+ are built with a powerful 50MP main camera, a 10MP tele-lens and a 12MP ultra-wide lens. Both the devices have a 10MP front sensor for selfies. The new Auto Framing feature can detect and track up to 10 people and automatically adjust the camera's focus. Both devices are powered by advanced VDIS technology which minimises vibrations, so you get smooth, sharp footage even when you're on the move. The entire Galaxy S22 series will be supported by up to four generations of Android OS upgrades. The Galaxy S22 series is secured by Samsung's powerful Knox Vault security platform, which includes a secure processor and memory that completely isolates sensitive data like your passwords, biometrics or Blockchain keys from the phone's main operating system.","

253,2022-01-31,14:15:54,technology,smartphones,iPhone 13 Pro users must drop everything else for this iOS update when it arrives; here's why [details]," Apple iPhone 13 Pro as well as Pro Max comes with 120Hz ProMotion displays, but only a handful of apps support 120 frames per second, but now a new report has claimed that the iOS 15.4 beta offers support for 120 Hz in all applications. It looks like Apple was able to squash the Core Animation bug that would not allow animations to go beyond 60 fps, reports GSMArena. It is impossible to confirm, right now, if all apps will run at 120 frames per second automatically. In addition, the iOS 15.4 beta added a new feature designed to allow Face ID to be used with a mask and without an Apple Watch for authentication. The tech giant said that the feature can ""recognise the unique features around the eye"" for authentication purposes. If you opt to use this feature during setup, you will need to rescan your face for Face ID. From there, Face ID will be able to unlock your iPhone even when you're wearing a mask.

254,2022-01-26,17:04:32,technology,smartphones,Apple is back on top in China; took 6 years to bounce back [details]," Apple has surpassed all local smartphone rivals in China in the fourth quarter (Q4) 2021 to become the top brand in China after six years when the iPhone 6 super-cycle was at its peak, a new report showed on Wednesday. The festive quarter (Q4) also brought Apple its highest ever market share in China at 23 per cent, according to Counterpoint Research's Monthly Market Pulse Service. ""Apple's stellar performance was driven by a mix of its pricing strategy and gain from Huawei's premium base. Apple rose to first place in China right after the iPhone 13 was released (week 39) in September,"" said research analyst Mengmeng Zang. Afterwards, it remained in the leading position for most of the fourth quarter. ""The new iPhone 13 has led to Apple's success due to a relatively lower starting price at its release in China, as well as the new camera and 5G features. Furthermore, Huawei, Apple's main competitor in the premium market, faced declining sales due to the ongoing US sanctions,"" Zang informed. However, China's smartphone sales in Q4 2021 declined 2 per cent (on-quarter) and 9 per cent (on-year), respectively. The country's full-year smartphone sales also continued the downward trend for the fourth consecutive year, declining 2 per cent YoY in 2021. China's smartphone market The market in China continues to decline due to various factors in both the supply side and the demand side. ""The ongoing component shortages are impacting shipments of all OEMs. Secondly, China's average smartphone replacement cycle is becoming longer. Smartphone designs within brands have also become more homogeneous, especially in hardware, failing to motivate consumers to upgrade,"" explained senior analyst Ivan Lam. China has also been experiencing a complex economic environment where exports are driving the growth and domestic spending remains lacklustre. Facing more severe component shortages, slower penetration in offline channels as well as competition from Honor, Xiaomi ranked fifth during the quarter. (With inputs from IANS)","

255,2022-01-26,15:34:42,technology,smartphones,"iPhone 13 review: Drops ""Pro"" moniker, retains flagship persona"," Apple iPhones have always been the premium flagships that everyone secretly (or even otherwise) yearned for. But with the Pro-series, Apple sent across a clear message that its iPhones are made even for the masses. The non-Pro models in the iPhone series got so popular, they became hot-sellers, and for good reason. Keeping up with the popular demand, the iPhone 13 added value to the 2021-flagship-series, in more ways than one. The iPhone 13 may get overshadowed by all the premium-ness and glamour of the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max, but it has its own understated value that attracts the masses. On that thought, let's dive deeper into what makes or breaks the iPhone 13. Key specs: - 6.1-inch display, 2532x1170 pixel resolution - A15 Bionic SoC - Dual 12MP camera - 12MP TrueDepth front camera - IP68 certification - Red, Starlight, Midnight, Blue and Pink colours   Design and display iPhone 13 mirrors the premium flat-edged design as seen in the iPhone 13 Pro. The smaller notch and diagonally arranged cameras on the back are the biggest cosmetic changes, which set the iPhone 13 apart. More than the iPhone 13 Pro, the iPhone 13's one change in how the camera sensors are arranged proved to be a conversation starter. The benefit of the camera rearrangement wasn't clear, but the upgrade is definitely evident in terms of the sensors used. iPhone 13's flat frame is made of aluminium and has been polished to match the back. In case of the pink model, the frame is matte pink. The same goes for the other colours in the offing. The glass back is prone to damage if manhandled, but silicone or hard case can add some durability. The front glass, however, is Apple's Ceramic Shield, which Apple claims to be more durable. It won't hurt to have a protective film. The design of the iPhone 13 is topped with IP68 certification for dust and water resistance, which means you won't have to be careful around the pool or on the beach. Apple has also silently lowered the positions of the physical buttons on the side. The power button, volume buttons and alert slider are easily reachable now than on the iPhone 12. iPhone 13 shares its display size with the iPhone 13 Pro at 6.1 inches, but is a lot lighter than the latter, which many will find rewarding. The panel itself is the beautiful OLED Super Reina with 1200nits peak brightness with HDR content (800nits otherwise) and support for DCI-P3 color gamut and True Tone feature. But the biggest disappointment is the lack of a higher refresh rate as on the iPhone 13 Pro. It's almost funny Apple still considers 120Hz refresh rate a ""Pro"" worthy feature when there are Android phones cheaper than the iPhone 13 with just that. Having used the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 side-by-side, the difference is evident. But Apple has done a fantastic job at keeping things smooth at 60Hz and you won't notice what you're missing out on unless you compare it against the iPhone 13 Pro. The display itself is crisp, bright and great for consuming content - both multimedia and games. The notch is still not prying for attention, and the fact that it is now smaller hardly made any difference. Apple could've used the extra screen real-estate to display some icons there, but alas. Overall, iPhone 13 looks great and feels even better. The light weight of the device makes it easy to handle and does not cause fatigue while binge-watching content. If your use-case is more than communication, the iPhone 13 is an ideal choice. The iPhone 13's display is the best you'll get if you're shopping in the non-Pro arena of flagships (read iPhone 12, Samsung Galaxy S21). Camera There's more to the iPhone 13 camera than the rearrangement of lenses. The sensor has gotten larger, allowing more light and instantly improving low-light photography. The difference is night and day. Apple has gone with a flagship-grade camera sensor and even the ultra-wide sensor is new, which produces images with less noise in varying light conditions. The iPhone 13 lacks a telephoto sensor and there's no macro mode, which works wonders on the iPhone 13 Pro. But the sensor-shift stabilisation is a boon. Interestingly, the iPhone 13 also retains the fun-tastic Cinematic mode, which despite being capped at 1080p, can sharpen your director skills. On a more practical note, the Photographic Styles will let you choose a preset filter based on your liking. Coming to the quality of the images, the iPhone 13 shoots crisp and detailed images. The colours are naturally toned with a hint of warmness. The dynamic range was good, exposures were consistent and low-light areas of the picture even retained maximum details. iPhone 13 shoots excellent portraits, with distinct outlining of the subject in focus and the background. The ultra-wide shots are done right, with the right amount of dramatic effect that's needed for your pictures. Even around the edges, the sensor manages to restore details. In low light or mid light conditions, the quality surely takes a dip, but the main sensor is always there for the rescue. iPhone 13 also shoots great selfies with natural skin tones and colours. The fact that we could use Photographic Styles for the front camera made the selfies better. Even the portraits are excellent, given how accurately the background is blurred. iPhone 13 is no Pro when it comes to shooting videos, but you won't be disappointed with the results. The Cinematic Mode might be a fun feature, the Dolby Vision HDR quality is more practical. The iPhone 13 can reduce noise impressively while offering a better dynamic range and natural and crisp colours. Switch to 4K, the result can leave you mesmerised. Shot on iPhone 13 Performance & software Performance is the core of ""Pro"" iPhones, but if your use doesn't push the limits, you won't feel the need to upgrade. The iPhone 13's A15 Bionic has one less GPU core than the iPhone 13 Pro, but the difference is not visible in day-to-day tasks. The iPhone 13 is perfectly capable of handling your gaming needs in addition to the daily tasks that come with this age of smartphone use. The stereo speakers on the iPhone 13 is both loud and clear. It can be useful in case you left your earphones behind and you wish to catch up on your TV show or join your squad for a quick match. You won't be disappointed. On the connectivity front, the iPhone 13 worked perfectly with Vodafone Idea 4G, but we wished the Wi-Fi range was better. Traditionally, Android phones have offered better range than iPhones and it is still the case. But when within range of the router, the Wi-Fi browsing is at par with flagships. Call connectivity and audio over calls worked as intended. With extended use of GPS+mobile data, the phone got warm, but not beyond manageable levels. Heating was not really an issue unless you have to go on a gaming marathon. FaceID on the iPhone 13 works well too. We did not have any rejects, except when we were wearing a face mask. But we did notice the iPhone 13 unlocked using Face ID at the same time as it did on the iPhone 13 Pro. iOS 15 on the iPhone 13 is the icing on the cake. The software experience is naturally similar to the iPhone 13 Pro. For those unintended, the Live Text feature is a life-saver and we found it to be of great use in our day-to-day tasks. It even picks text from Google Lens in real-time. Safari went through a major change by putting the tabs at the bottom, which after getting used to, we found it to be intuitive. You can always go back to the original top tab view, but we got used to Tab Bar. Every time you get on a video call using WhatsApp or FaceTime, you get to choose portrait mode to give that bokeh effect. The notifications have now been sorted and you also get a new summary view. Other changes include improved Maps (still prefer Google Maps, though), and a full-fledged Weather App. iOS 15 is not about making grand gestures, but it is the little things that make a whole lot of difference in your virtual world. Battery Apple didn't nearly brag as much about the iPhone 13's battery, in our opinion. The iPhone 13 surely outlasts the iPhone 12 - all thanks to a bigger battery, power-efficient display and A15 Bionic. The iPhone 13 lasted a whole day without breaking a sweat. On a busy day, involving a lot of camera use, gaming, etc, the battery drained sooner. With the power-saving mode, we could make it through the day. But the area where iPhones really need to buckle up is charging speeds. The iPhone 13 can be charged to full in a little over an hour with a 20W Apple charger. There are phones capable of fully charging in less than 30 minutes you know. This can make a lot of difference in real-world use. But being the longer-lasting iPhone, we might be able to give this one a pass. Verdict iPhone 13 is a great phone overall. It's both expensive and affordable by industry and Apple standards. But what you get for the price is a phone with superb cameras, great performance, crisp display, excellent battery and above all, premium design. Apple takes pride in the iOS ecosystem and if you're a part of it, the iPhone 13 fits perfectly. It makes perfect sense to go for the iPhone 13 from iPhone 11 or older. You will be better off with this one for a few more years if annual upgrade isn't your cup of tea. Having an adaptive 120Hz display would've made it future-proof. Pros Cons","

256,2022-01-24,17:27:50,technology,smartphones,OnePlus 9RT review: Too (similarly) good," OnePlus has proven its mettle time and again. 2021 was a good year for the brand, 2022 is going to be better going by the early response it has gathered for the OnePlus 10 Pro, which was launched recently in China. Fans in India are eager for the new flagship, but before the big launch, OnePlus decided to keep its launch cycle busy with the OnePlus 9RT. Expanding the 2021-flagship line, OnePlus 9RT is the successor to the OnePlus 9R and marks a modest upgrade. The 9RT is priced at Rs 42,999 for the 8GB RAM and 128GB storage model. If that's not enough, there's 12GB+256GB configuration for Rs 46,999. At this price point, OnePlus 9RT is treading in a competitive territory. Let's see if the 9RT has got what it takes to impress buyers. Design and display OnePlus 9RT brings back a nostalgia factor, giving the impression of a sandstone finish. But in reality, the back panel is actually glass - Corning Gorilla Glass 5 to be precise. But the way it has been designed is pleasing to the eye. The Hacker Black is particularly good looking. What appears to be deep black, glitters like a starry night when light falls on it at certain angles. The OnePlus logo is also in black, so is everything else, making it a true black-edition phone. The triple camera module with LED flash takes its regular position on the top right corner. The power and volume controls too are on either side of the phone, well within the fingers' reach. The signature Alert Slider is on the right side of the phone, the dual speaker setup at the bottom alongside the USB Type-C port. While everything seems in its regular place, OnePlus 9RT is on the tad bulky side, which can be attributed to the tall frame of the phone and 198.5 grams weight. The back panel curving into the chassis gives a slight advantage of the phone appearing sleeker. But the glass unibody design makes it slippery, but there's a free rubber case that doesn't take away the OnePlus factor away from the phone while adding grip. OnePlus 9RT features a large 6.62-inch display with Full HD+ resolution. With a peak brightness of 1,300 nits, 120Hz refresh rate and 600Hz touch sampling rate, the 9RT is ideal for gaming and multimedia consumption. The panel offers punchy output, vivid colours and deep blacks. The smooth animations make transitions and engaging with content a seamless experience and so easy on the eyes. The panel is responsive. OnePlus has retained its gaming expertise to the 9RT. Overall handling the phone while playing games on the bright display is only making your experience better. Camera OnePlus 9RT rocks a 50MP IMX766 primary sensor, which is paired with a 16MP ultra-wide lens and a 2MP macro sensor. On the front is a modest 16MP sensor. With this setup, the 9RT is over-reaching but excels in certain areas. There's no Hasselblad magic, which is quite evident, but you won't miss it if you are not demanding too much. OnePlus 9RT's primary camera sensor is capable of delivering good on your expectations. The sensor is capable of natural colour reproduction, capturing good details and resolution. Under good light, the noise is well controlled. Low-light images are well reproduced with the help of night mode. OnePlus has certainly come a long way in this department. The ultra-wide camera also delivers decent output, especially around the edges. In low-light, the results are not as great, but overall the results are acceptable. Finally, the macro mode is not the best out there, but the results are acceptable for a 2MP sensor. There weren't any high expectations anyway. Macro mode is a nice addition to have, but you won't be using it much anyway for it to qualify as a USP. The selfies are pretty average, to be honest. The colour tones were not up to the mark, but you will still be able to capture moments for your social media feeds. Check out some camera samples below: Performance and software OnePlus 9RT is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 888 chipset, which in our opinion is the biggest USP of the phone. Even the storage and RAM are snappy at UFS 3.1 and LPDDR5, respectively. The handset can handle all your day-to-day tasks without breaking a sweat. Even while playing some high graphics games, the phone didn't heat and exhibit strain. The sheer lack of 120fps games is still a bummer, but you have plenty of games at 60fps to keep your free time occupied. But so much potential is just wasted here. We did not face any issues with regard to connectivity as well. Even while streaming content on 4G or Wi-Fi, or playing games online, the 9RT maintained steady connections with Reliance Jio and ACT Fibernet. The apps, both system and installed ones launch in an instant without delay. On the software side of things, those who had reservations about the ColorOS-effect will be relieved. The interface is kept clean and free of bloatware. The Oppo's influence is garnished here and there, like the camera app and launcher. The gestures work accurately, we didn't notice any lags or bugs during the time we were using the phone. Having all the personalisations in one place did make things a lot simpler. Overall, we didn't find any major red flags with the OxygenOS onboard, except for the fact that it still runs Android 11. The fingerprint scanner under the display works efficiently. The face unlock works as intended, but we'd rather rely on the biometric sensor for better security. It would be nice if companies enlarged the area of fingerprint scanning on the display, but the muscle memory rarely faults the effort in the 9RT. Until comes a time otherwise, we are happy with it. Battery OnePlus 9RT is powered by a 4,500mAh battery, which was sufficient for a full day's worth of use. Of course, the battery is OnePlus' strong suit and the 65W Warp Charger in the box reinforces that commitment. It takes 40 minutes to fully charge the phone, which Apple and Samsung users will find refreshing. It is nice to see some battery saving options like Always-on-display timeout. The handset consistently delivered 5.5+ hours of screen-on-time. Without heavy gaming or continuous consumption of media, the smartphone can easily last a whole day and still have some juice left. It's not clear just how much effect the power saving options have on the overall battery, but choosing a 60Hz refresh rate can definitely add some hours. In our view, it's not worth the trade. Verdict OnePlus 9RT is a solid phone, more so if OnePlus hadn't launched the 9R or the 9. It might be confusing for some buyers to pick this one. But if you narrowed it down to this model, this is why you should consider it. OnePlus 9RT has a familiar design, which is a good thing, solid build quality, incredible performance and reliable battery. The cameras could have been better, macro and selfies in particular. But OnePlus is not threatened by its own siblings as much as it is from the competition you'll find in the market. You'll find the software still working in OnePlus' favour, which is where it might have an edge over its rivals. But it's a thin line and OnePlus better up its game in its flagship spin-off series.","

257,2022-01-23,18:17:47,technology,smartphones,iPhone 13 'pink screen' issue affects small number of users; how to fix it [details]," A so-called ""pink screen"" issue is affecting a small number of iPhone 13 units, with a brightly-coloured display and crashes thought by Apple support teams to be a software problem, not hardware.  According to AppleInsider, shortly after the release of the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro lines in late 2021, a small number of users encountered a frustrating situation with their smartphones. Their iPhones would lock up and display a pink screen, the report said. Posts to Apple's support forum offer many examples of the phenomenon, with the general symptoms being the pink display, freezes, and crashes. As per the report, there is no indication as to what is specifically causing it for the users, but it is seemingly a fixable situation. Some users state a reset of settings of the iPhone eliminates the problem, while others say they contacted Apple and swapped their handsets for a replacement.  According to a report from MyDrivers about Chinese users encountering the issue, it appears that Apple is aware of the problem's existence. A customer service representative is said to have told a consumer that the team hadn't received ""relevant notices"" that it was a hardware problem, but said it was a system issue instead. The advice to affected users is to back up their data and then either factory reset or update iOS to the latest version. If the issue continues to occur, then a hardware repair may be warranted. ","

259,2022-01-11,01:09:29,technology,smartphones,Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G First Impressions," Samsung is capitalising on the popularity of the Galaxy S20 FE's success with the launch of Galaxy S21 FE 5G. After selling 10 million units of the S20 FE and S20 FE 5G editions globally, the launch of S21 FE 5G is a logical next step. But the bigger question is can the Galaxy S21 FE live up to the hype? Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G wears a premium flagship face, much akin to the Galaxy S21 lineup. The smartphone offers a pretty premium package with a price that can no longer be considered exorbitant considering the new wave of flagships in the market. Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G is priced at Rs. 54,999 for the 128GB variant and Rs. 58,999 for 256GB model, but there's a limited-period cashback offer on HDFC Bank cards, which knocks off Rs 5,000 on the above prices. Here are our first impressions of the Galaxy S21 FE 5G. First impressions Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G's design is a huge part of the phone's USP from what we can gather. The phone comes in a sleek box, without the power adaptor. All you get inside the box besides the phone is a USB Type-C to Type-C cable and a SIM eject pin. But that's just the way most flagships are going to be in a bid to reduce e-waste. Moving on to the phone, where most of the action is, the Galaxy S21 FE takes serious inspiration from the Galaxy S21. The phone has a swept-back camera module that fuses into the frame similar to the S21, but the back panel is made of plastic. The smooth matte finish feels great and keeps smudges at bay, but you won't get that premium feel-factor. On the plus side, the phone is lighter and easier to handle with single hand. Samsung has even managed to offer IP68 protection, which doesn't make plastic back a regrettable choice anymore. On a more practical front, the Galaxy S21 FE is more durable than phones with glass bodies. The metal chassis adds some weight to the phone, tipping the scales at 177 grams. The power button and volume rockers are placed on the right side of the phone. The positioning of the buttons is in such a way that the volume up button requires you to stretch your thumb or the index finger. On the front is a 6.4-inch FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED display, which maintains Samsung's integrity. The display offers 120Hz refresh rate, which makes transitions truly smooth. The haptic feedback is excellent. For multimedia buffs, the display is rich in colours and vivid. There's a punch-hole camera centrally aligned on top, which hardly gets in the way of any content you consume, be it gaming or streaming. Samsung displays are never really areas of criticism and the Galaxy S21 FE easily has one of the best displays one has to offer in the market. Finally, the in-display optical fingerprint sensor works flawlessly. What we are really excited to check out in the Galaxy S21 FE is the performance as it is powered by Exynos 2100 - the same SoC as the Galaxy S21 series. Flagship-grade performance is likely guaranteed on this phone, something we have experienced with the S21 siblings. We'll still be putting the phone through daily tests to see if there are any kinks. Samsung packs some useful features such as stereo speakers, Wireless Dex mode support, reverse wireless charging, a 4,500mAh battery with 25W fast wired charging and 15W wireless charging. In fact, we wish to see Samsung level up on the fast-charging front. With these features, Samsung Galaxy S21 FE offers a premium flagship experience on a budget. A smooth end-user experience topped with brand value and long-term software support do come into consideration. Stay tuned for our full review of Galaxy S21 FE 5G.","

The wearable is built around a 'monocle waveguide' design and features free-flowing curves that offer lightweight and minimalist appearance. The device is set to be launched in Q1 2022 in China first. OPPO Air Glass With a total weight of approximately 30 grams, OPPO Air Glass is one of the lightest monocle waveguide devices in the industry and can be worn much like a pair of regular glasses, the company announced at its 'INNO Day 2021'. ""OPPO has been exploring the possibilities of Extended Reality (XR) for a long time, and with Air Glass, we have finally created a smart glass product that is truly within the reach of consumers,"" said Levin Liu, OPPO Vice President and Head of OPPO Research Institute. ""The easy-to-use display can present key messages we need right in front of our eyes. With OPPO Air Glass, the world will never look the same again,"" he added. The lens is secured to a light and slim frame, which houses all the components, including the Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 4100 Platform. The 'Spark Micro Projector' is roughly the size of a coffee bean, and features a CNC metal enclosure with a glass lens module to provide better heat dissipation and stability. The projector is powered by a cutting-edge Micro LED, which has a brightness of up to 3 million nits. OPPO Air Glass is designed to be as accessible to as many people as possible, including users with refractive errors such as myopia and hypermetropia, said the company. The glasses are available in two different types of frames -- a silver half-frame, and a black full-frame that can better accommodate users who require corrective eyewear. The 'Air Glass' can be operated using the Smart Glass App on OPPO Watch 2 and any OPPO smartphone installed with ColorOS 11 or above versions. When Air Glass is paired with an OPPO Watch 2, users can also use hand movements to confirm, cancel, and switch application cards.

271,2021-11-17,19:38:56,technology,smartphones,iQoo Z5 review: A mid-ranger worth considering for your gaming needs," Indian smartphone space is rich with competition and options are vast for consumers who are looking to upgrade in practically any price range. Between Apple and Reliance Jio, there are plenty of both affordable and high-end smartphone brands giving tough competition to one another. This helps the end consumer as the by-product of this competition is feature-rich smartphones at competitive prices. iQoo is one of the brands that is leaving an impression in the mid-range smartphone space with its offerings and the most recent iQoo Z5 offers good delivery at just the right price. iQoo Z5 is a successor to the first Z-series model, the Z3 smartphone. Carrying all the markers of a successful smartphone, the Z5 aims to surpass the competition. The base variant with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage is priced at Rs 23,990 whereas the 12GB+256GB configuration costs Rs 26,990. We got the latter for review. Let's take a look to see if iQoo Z5 has got what it takes to stay relevant in the competitive sub-Rs 30K segment. Design iQoo Z5 has fallen far from its predecessor in terms of design, with some subtle yet crucial changes. The smartphone comes in two shades, Mystic Space and Arctic Dawn, and we got the former. The matte gradient finish on the back changes from black to blue like the shades of the night sky. The metallic frames compliment the overall design and it is also not slippery. The big part of the rear panel is the camera setup, which sits inside a protruding module on the top left corner. Given the current trend, it protruding camera doesn't even bother. The iQoo branding is quite subtle too and the matte finish of the back cover keeps fingerprint smudges at bay, so you don't really need a back cover for this one. However, the complimentary TPU case can be used if you have butterfingers. The volume rockers and the power/lock button are placed on the right side and the slight descent in the frame makes it easy to spot. All the buttons are well within reach. The power button also functions as a fingerprint scanner, which is efficient and fast. At the bottom, you'll find the USB Type-C port alongside a speaker grille and a hybrid SIM card slot. For those who still like the old-school wired earphones, there's a 3.5mm headphone jack on the top. The overall design of the handset makes for a good in-hand feel and the form factor as well as the weight distribution makes the Z5 quite handy. Display iQoo Z5 has a rather large 6.67-inch display, which is ideal for multimedia consumption and playing games. The 1080p resolution panel has a 120Hz refresh rate, which makes all the difference while playing some high-graphics games on the phone. It also makes scrolling really smooth and the touch response is accurate. The LCD panel on the iQoo Z5 makes it rather an affordable choice for those who frequently drop their phones and break the displays. The display also supports HDR 10, which enables HD viewing. The visuals are balanced, colours are rich and the display offers decent viewing angles. If you're the one to look for details, you'll notice the lack of clarity while running darker hues on the screen. There are some customisation options like you can choose screen colours, set the colour temperature, and most importantly you can choose the refresh rate at which the screen operates or simply go with ""smart switch."" The display offers decent amount of brightness when outdoors, whereas it is perfect for indoor use. Overall, the display meets your day-to-day needs, yet iQoo could've done better with an AMOLED panel to gain an edge over rivals. Performance iQoo Z5 is powered by a Snapdragon 778G processor, which is paired with 12GB RAM in our case. It packs a punch when it comes to gaming and takes care of your daily tasks with ease. We did not notice any lags during gaming, but we did see some delay in launching apps after a reboot. The handset manages heat pretty well during gaming sessions and gets slightly warm if you play games while the phone is charging. While there are no major kinks with the performance per se, it is the UI that could use some improvement. It runs Funtouch OS 12 based on Android 11, which comes with its own share of pros and cons. On the bright side, the OS offers a vast range of customisation options while trying to come close to stock Android UI. But the same UI is marred by loaded bloatware, some of which are not removable. iQoo could go for snappier transitions minus the extra apps that people rarely use. On the security front, the handset's fingerprint sensor works effortlessly and the face unlock works well under good lighting. Camera iQoo Z5 has a modest triple camera setup, comprising of a 64MP primary lens, an 8MP ultra-wide sensor and a 2MP macro sensor. The camera supports OIS and shoots 4K videos at 60fps. The primary sensor is a Samsung GW3, which produces decent output. In broad daylight, you'll get sharper images with good details. You'll find yourself shooting with the primary sensor more often than the other two lenses. The ultra-wide-angle lens captures a larger area and gives a dramatic effect to your photos. There's some level of distortion around the edges, but it is visible if you look closely. As for the macro mode, the output is quite good provided there's good lighting on the subject. The portrait mode works well too, identifying the subject in the foreground while blurring the background for a soft bokeh effect. The smartphone also has a night mode, which does little to add value here. Even shooting photos in low-light isn't Z5's strongest suit. On the front, you get a 16MP snapper, which works well to capture selfies and portraits of yourself to be shared on social media. While the portrait mode works better in indoor lighting, there's artificial smoothening, which takes out the natural element out of the picture. Don't expect to get a lot of details in low-light settings even with your front camera. The results are average at best. Battery iQoo Z5 packs a 5,000mAh battery, which is surprising given the slim profile of the device. We did not have any reservations regarding the battery life considering the size of the battery and the phone's configuration. We were able to make it through an entire day on a single charge with plenty left to let you catch up on some of your TV shows. If you are an avid gamer and a multimedia buff, the battery will naturally drain faster. But on average, you can easily make it through the day without having to worry about carrying the charger. With moderate use, you can easily get the phone running for almost two days. The smartphone also comes bundled with 44W fast charger in the box, which manages to refuel the smartphone quickly. It can fully charge the phone from zero to 100% in an hour, which saves a lot of time. Verdict iQoo Z5 is a well-rounded smartphone, its specs are balanced out and priced right for the masses. The gaming prowess will win the phone accolades, but the phone has its own shortcomings. The UI could have been more refined, cameras could use some improvement in some specific areas and opting for an AMOLED panel would've sealed the deal. But things like competitive pricing, 5G support, good performance, and excellent battery work well in iQoo's favour. It's definitely an upgrade from Z3.","

272,2021-11-16,22:49:21,technology,smartphones,"OnePlus Nord 2 Pac-Mac Edition is full of surprises, many cool Easter eggs [hands-on]"," Pac-Man used to be a popular maze game back in the day and there's hardly anyone who hasn't heard of this arcade game. OnePlus, a household name in the smartphone arena decided to bring back some of those fond memories in the most fun and exciting way possible. Launching a new smartphone in its Nord series, OnePlus offers a bag full of surprises and many interesting easter eggs. OnePlus has a rich history of collector's edition phones and we absolutely loved what the company did with OnePlus 5T Star Wars Edition and OnePlus 7T Pro McLaren Edition, which was more refined than the OnePlus 6T McLaren Edition. With the all-new Pac-Man edition, OnePlus just upped the ante on collector's edition phones. While it's easier to find McLaren and Star Wars fans, the Pac-Man edition of OnePlus Nord 2 takes a targeted approach. Nevertheless, OnePlus Nord 2 x Pac-Mac Edition is fun, full of surprises and a ton of easter eggs that make it truly cool. Unboxing More often than not, OnePlus doesn't get due credit for the way its phones are packaged. Best-in-class premium packaging improves the first impressions of the company and OnePlus has remained consistent over the years. OnePlus Nord 2 Pac-Man Edition has a theme packaging down to the T. The Pac-Man branding is quite prominent on the packaging as well. Inside the box, you get the phone, 65W charger, Type-C cable, Red Club membership card and a Pac-Man-inspired silicone case is hidden inside a secret compartment. The phone has a subtle Pac-Man embellishment whereas the case completes that Pac-Man theme by bringing in its iconic characters. Design and some more On the phone itself, the Nord 2 has a tiny Pac-Man character under the camera module and on the left side of it is OnePlus x Pac-Man branding, which is in its entire subtlety. The back panel has a subtle green shade on the glossy panel, which has dots arranged in a way of a grid, which is again in line with the Pac-Mac theme. OnePlus logo can be found at the bottom right and the iconic Alert Slider on this Nord 2 Pac-Man edition gets a royal blue shade, which ties up the theme altogether. But the best part of the phone is none of it. The phone's back panel has a fluorescent design that glows in the dark to reveal a neon maze. It's super cool and by far the best design implementation as far as collaborations go. If you are buying the OnePlus Nord 2 x Pac-Man Edition, there's another cool surprise waiting for you. The overall design of the phone is complemented by a DIY Pac-Man phone holder made of legos. In fact, OnePlus has hidden some cool easter eggs associated with the holder as well. This phone keeps you exploring endlessly. Customers can use their Red Cable Club Membership to redeem the special phone holder and it will be shipped to you separately. Software tweaked to match theme OnePlus Nord 2 Pac-Mac Edition's software is tweaked to please Pac-Man fans. Right from the boot screen to the phone menu, you'll see OnePlus has put in a lot of effort in making sure the software aligns with the overall Pac-Man theme. And of course, Pac-Man 256 game is pre-installed on the phone, which you can delete if you want. OnePlus offers Pac-Man theme wallpapers; some of the icons get an 8-bit pixelated makeover; the fingerprint animation gets a nice Pac-Man touch; and the notification panel has neon and blue colours with a tiny Pac-Man that moves to eat food every time you swipe to see other options. It's the little things that add to the overall user experience. There's more. OnePlus has added some cool Pac-Man tunes for ringtone and alerts. There's a fun filter in the camera app called PACnormaly, which adds Pac-Man and Ghosts in the viewfinder. To further add the Pac-Man effect, there are some stickers added to the integrated editor in the Gallery app. The charging animation is also tweaked to show Pac-Man character eating power pellets for a few seconds when you plug the phone in. But these are just a few of many easter eggs we have been able to find so far. Conclusion OnePlus Nord 2 Pac-Man Edition packs the same specs as the Nord 2. Right from its 50MP triple camera setup to Warp Charge 65 and Dimensity 1200-AI chip to 90Hz Fluid AMOLED display. So the goodness of Nord 2 is fused perfectly into the Pac-Man theme to give you a fun result. This collector's edition smartphone costs Rs 3,000 extra, which in our view is worth every buck since there's so much to explore. It's interesting to see OnePlus bring special edition phones in its Nord-series, which is more affordable, and not just limit to its flagship series. Perhaps a Call of Duty edition would have been exciting, but the Pac-Man is still a fun game from its time (read 80s and early 90s) and bound to strike a chord with gaming enthusiasts. OnePlus could have gone with a matching charger and the cable instead chose to keep it plain and simple. Perhaps, you can use those stickers in the box to give your own Pac-Man theme to the charger.","

276,2021-11-04,16:13:09,technology,smartphones,Light up your Diwali: iPhone camera tips to get that perfect shot [guide]," Diwali is the festival of lights and an opportunity for some picturesque moments. Be it the rangoli outside your home or a diya lit up in the balcony, capturing these small things will show the festive celebrations even without a caption. Now, as you would normally dress up for the occasion, it would be such a waste if that ethnic attire is not captured and shared with friends and family who couldn't make it to the party. In this article, we will take you through some quick and easy tips and tricks to make sure the photos you capture this Diwali on your iPhone are not just eating into your phone's storage. But first, let us get your started with some prerequisites. These settings will be sufficient to get you started. iPhone camera tips and tricks Diwali is time of parties and celebrations. It's possible there was some sweet on your fingers, which made its way to the iPhone camera lens. First things first, clean the camera lens with a cloth for better results or you'll regret later. Now, different scenes require different settings. It's all just a few seconds away - thanks to the iPhones that have gone way too smarter over the years. The iPhone 13 Pro's camera setup is magical as it can capture those low-light shots as well as candid portraits with such ease. When shooting, remember these simple tips. Set the focus and exposure for better-quality images. Tap on your subject for focus and use the brightness slider to choose the perfect range - not too dark or too bright. Use AE/AF Lock to your advantage. Simply tap and hold the screen for a few seconds at the point of focus and a yellow box with the AE/AF Lock option will appear at the top of the screen and at that point you can shoot. This is extremely useful during Diwali as you would be taking more than one photo at the same scene. Burst mode is so underrated. People would rather take multiple shots than use this feature. We'd recommend using Burst Mode by holding down the shutter button for a few seconds. This mode is useful while capturing moving subjects or even when you want to capture a passing moment. You can later pick the best shot by going into the Photos and hit Select at the bottom of the photo. Long exposure shots are great to look at, but often mistaken as exclusive talent of a professional photographer. In fact, you can do that with your iPhone. Use the Live Photos feature, which records a 3-second Live Photo with movement and sound. Once captured, just choose the Long Exposure effect from the Photos app and et voila. Macros on the iPhone 13 series are simply extraordinary. It gets activated automatically when you get close to your subject and a diya has never really looked so beautiful when captured with iPhone 13 Pro's Macro mode. Portraits shot on iPhone are loved by one and all. With the iPhone 13 Pro, things have only gotten better - so so better. Use the portrait mode at 1x or 3x to get that perfect candid portrait shot. You can even use different effects for background, adjust the bokeh even after taking the shot. Moreover, try playing with foregrounds as well, as it can be blurred just as easily the iPhone blurs the background. The wide-angle mode on the iPhone 13 Pro adds extra oomph to your photos. Make sure you use it, but it is important to frame the shots right in the wide-angle mode. Night mode will truly light up your Diwali. The iPhone 13 Pro automatically detects low-light settings to brighten up the image without taking away the ""night"" element of the picture. It's like magic to see how the night mode works on the iPhone 13 Pro. Photography Styles are something new to iPhones and it's worth exploring this Diwali. You get to choose a photo profile, standard, rich contrast, vibrant, warm or cool. These styles will be applied to your photos so don't have to edit the photos later. Alternatively, try using the iPhone filters if that's more your style. Enough of photos, let's switch to videos. Diwali is all about those special moments and what better way than to capture them all. Like we said earlier, 4K at 60fps shots are great, both in quality and size. But there's more. Use Slo-Mo mode in the iPhone, which works perfectly under well-lit areas. With the iPhone 13 Pro, we recommend using the Slo-Mo with wide-angle and even 3x zoom and use flash in case there is low light. Moreover, you can choose to record slow-mo at 108p HD at 240fps. We saved the best for the last. The Cinematic Mode on the iPhone 13 series should be the highlight of this article and the videos captured using this mode of Diwali this year. Apple has made it possible to shoot professional-grade videos with beautiful transitions. This Diwali, the Cinematic Mode is a must.","

For the unversed, the X70 Pro is priced at Rs 46,990 for 8GB+128GB variant, Rs 49,990 for 8GB+256GB variant and Rs 52,990 for 12GB+256GB variant. Our review unit is of the highest configuration. Vivo X70 Pro specs Display: 6.56"" AMOLED, 120Hz, HDR10+, Full HD+ resolution CPU: MediaTek MT6893 Dimensity 1200 5G (6 nm) Camera: 50MP PDAF, gimbal OIS + 12MP PDAF, 2x optical zoom + 8MP PDAF, OIS, 5x optical zoom + 12MP sensor Front camera: 32MP f/2.5, 26mm Battery: 4450mAh, Fast charging 44W Design and display Vivo X70 Pro is easily one of the better-looking phones out there, which works in its advantage. The extremely thin profile makes it easy to handle and looks gorgeous. The handset features a premium design, which reciprocates when you hold it in the hand. The rear panel has an interesting design. The frosted glass-like finish made of fluorite gives a non-slippery feel and even keeps fingerprint smudges at bay. The camera module is slightly protruding, but reasonable considering there are two zoom cameras. The LED flash is stacked inside a metal profile right next to the quad-camera sensors. Moving on, the volume rocker and the power key are positioned on the right side of the frame, which is likely aluminium. The physical buttons are well within the thumb's reach. At the bottom is the USB Type-C port alongside the speaker and SIM card tray. This leaves the left side frame empty. As expected, there's no 3.5mm jack and the fingerprint scanner is placed under the display. Surprisingly, Vivo X70 Pro packs an IR blaster, which can be used by the remote control app in the phone. Now, for the display, the X70 Pro features a 6.56-inch Full HD+ resolution panel with a 120Hz refresh rate, which makes a lot of difference in the user experience. The display is also HDR10+ certified, which enhances the viewing experience, especially while viewing multimedia content. The display is really bright and the content is easily viewable under direct sunlight. Vivo went with a punch-hole selfie camera, which goes with the current trend. The sides are curved, which covers the display from edge-to-edge but it might not be everyone's taste. The touch response time is good, works well during gaming as well. Cameras Vivo X70 Pro is advertised as a camera smartphone and it rightly should be. The smartphone offers flagship-grade photos. The main camera sensor allows you to capture vibrant photos and the colours just pop. The cameras manage to capture good details in daylight, excellent dynamic range and punchy colours. A huge part of the camera is the zoom, which works well. The 2x zoom camera manages to capture good details and sharpness, but there's definitely noise visible, which is not apparent in the 1x shots. Things get interesting with 5x though, as it matches the quality of 2x zoom, which is impressive. Of course, the zoom works well in ideal lighting and the noise is reduced to a minimal level. There are other camera modes, including wide-angle, portrait and macro. The wide-angle sensor can capture good landscapes without distorting the sides. The quality is not matching the main sensor, but it surely does leave an impression. The camera shoots well even when there's a harsh backlight. The portrait mode adds a nice bokeh effect and there's good edge detection. Under challenging light conditions, the edge detection is inconsistent, but the night mode is able to work its magic to brighten up your portraits. The Super Macro mode lets you get really close to your subjects and give your photos a new perspective. In fact, the X70 Pro's macro shots are one of the better ones we have seen. Shooting in macro is effortless with the X70 Pro. Finally, the night mode in the camera is able to light up the areas really needed instead of just brightening the entire image. Low light images shot on the X70 Pro will exceed your expectations. There's no lens flare, well-contained noise, dark shadows and a good amount of details. The front camera with its 32MP sensor, comparatively, is an average performer. The details are amiss, colours are a bit washed off and the bokeh effect is not accurate. Below are some of the camera samples: Performance Vivo X70 Pro is powered by MediaTek's Dimensity 1200 chipset, which is a powerful processor clocking at 3GHz through Cortex A78 main core and three Cortex A78 cores at 2.6GHz. The device we reviewed had 12GB onboard RAM and 4GB Extended RAM, which gets borrowed from 256GB. This configuration sounds ideal, but it's not the best out there. The X70 Pro tackles all your day-to-day tasks with ease, but the difference is seen where there's demand for raw power. The X70 Pro does not perform as well as the OnePlus 9 series. If you're not oh-so-reliant on high-performing tasks, the X70 Pro holds the spec-sheet together and takes care of most of your day-to-day tasks. Vivo X70 Pro runs FunTouchOS12 based on Android 11, which brings an interesting mix of stock and custom UI experience. You can customise the phone as per your taste or keep things simple. There's not much bloatware to eat up your phone's space. You get eye protection for display in addition to the dark theme, download new fonts, choose your screen calibration and switch between 60Hz or 120Hz or simply get the Smart Switch. There are a host of dynamic effects, which lets you customise the various effects and animations. Finally, the fingerprint scanner works flawlessly and it's snappy. You just need to get accustomed to the position of the fingerprint scanner to be able to unlock it with a touch. Battery Vivo X70 Pro has a decent size of battery, but the battery life is vastly improved over its predecessor. The power-efficient E5 AMOLED display should get credit where its due. The smartphone easily lasted a whole day, with 6+ hours of screen on time. It includes calls, messaging, IMs, social media browsing, internet browsing and multimedia consumption. With increased gaming and binge-watching, the battery tends to drop, but that's expected. Even then, the X70 Pro is one of the best smartphones for battery life in its range. The smartphone comes bundled with a 44W Flash Charge adapter, which gave us 60 percent battery in just 30 minutes and reached to 100 percent in one hour. Verdict Vivo X70 Pro is a well-rounded flagship in a mid-range package. It throws a tough competition in specific areas such as design, camera and battery. There might be other better performing phones out there than the X70 Pro, the Vivo smartphone packs a punch in areas where it excels. The lack of stereos, wireless charging support and average performance are some areas we feel the smartphone lags, but the rest remains competitive to take on the toughest contenders.","

282,2021-10-20,16:25:47,technology,smartphones,"OPPO goes Apple, Samsung way; developing its own smartphone chips [details]"," In a bid to gain control over core components and reduce its reliance on foreign semiconductor suppliers Qualcomm and MediaTek, smartphone brand OPPO is developing high-end mobile chips for its premium handsets, a media report said on Wednesday. The world's fourth-largest smartphone maker by shipments plans to use its own mobile systems-on-a-chip (SoC) in phones due out in 2023 or 2024, depending on the speed of development, citing sources, Nikkei Asia reported. OPPO thus joins a race of smartphone makers -- including Apple, Samsung and Xiaomi -- that are developing their own processors. Tech giant Google on Tuesday unveiled the Pixel 6, its first smartphone using its Tenor mobile processor. In-house chip development Developing key chips in-house could also enhance supply chain control and possibly soften widespread shortages and disruptions, the report said. OPPO is looking to use the 3-nanometer chip production technology offered by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TMSC), the world's biggest contract chipmaker, sources said. This would make it part of a second wave of TSMC clients, following Apple and Intel, to use the cutting-edge tech. Sources said this is a sign of OPPO's commitment to developing high-end mobile chips capable of competing with the globe's top semiconductor developers. In-house designed processors have become a hallmark of the world's leading smartphone brands. Apple began putting its A-series mobile processors in iPhones a decade ago. Huawei Technologies, once the world's largest smartphone maker, made its mark with its Kirin processor before a US clampdown on the company derailed its consumer electronics business.

283,2021-10-10,13:02:08,technology,smartphones,Samsung Galaxy M52 5G review: Delivers on what matters most," Samsung is rapidly expanding its range of smartphones and the recent addition to its mid-range segment is the all-new Galaxy M52 5G, which upholds the company's commitment to delivering a mix of competitive features at an aggressive price point. Samsung Galaxy M52 5G sits comfortably in the sub-Rs 30K category, taking on the competition like other brands in India. Samsung Galaxy M52 5G starts at Rs 29,999 for the base model with 6GB+128GB configuration and Rs 31,999 for 8GB+128GB option. Our review unit is the latter variant in Blazing Black shade, but there's also an Icy Blue colour for your liking. For the price, Samsung Galaxy M52 5G features a 6.7-inch Super AMOLED Plus display with Full HD+ resolution. Following the current trend, the display sports 120Hz refresh rate. The handset is quite handful, but doesn't feel heavy in hand at all and has a sleek form factor - true to the ""leanest and meanest device"" slogan. We dive deeper into the Galaxy M52 to find out if the smartphone has what it takes to make it to the customer's wish-list. Design Samsung Galaxy M52 has a sleek form-factor and a lightweight design. The phone has a 7.4mm profile and tips the scale at just 173 grams. Although it isn't the leanest and lightest phone in the market (Mi 11X Lite takes that title), it still feels comfortable in hand and it's easy to use. The smartphone has a Gorilla Glass 5 on the front and a polycarbonate back, which has a glossy finish giving a glass-like finish. The rear panel has a fine striped pattern, which is quite subtle much to our liking. The glossy finish on the back does, however, picks fingerprint smudges - nothing a case wouldn't fix. The rear camera bump, which has a triple sensor, protrudes off the body. On the right, you get the power button and volume controls. The power button isn't protruding like the volume buttons, but it is by design to house a fingerprint sensor. The left side of the phone has a SIM card tray, which is a dual SIM hybrid model. At the bottom, the Galaxy M52 has a USB Type-C port and a speaker grille. There's no stereo support, but the best experience is anyways offered through headphones. If you were vouching for a 3.5mm headphone jack, you will be disappointed. All in all, Samsung Galaxy M52 5G has a premium design and feels great in hand too. The polycarbonate back adds durability, but it won't hurt to have a case to avoid smudges. Losing the 3.5mm jack doesn't feel much of a setback in 2021. Display Samsung Galaxy M52 sports a 6.7-inch Full HD+ sAMOLED+ display. The front camera is housed inside a punch-hole instead of a notch, which makes the phone look modern. The notable upgrade is the 120Hz refresh rate, which can be set to 60Hz if you prefer longer battery and stuttering interface. The display resolution at 1080x2400 pixels is satisfactory. Samsung always offers great displays in its phones and the M52 continues that tradition. The display offers vibrant picture quality with deep blacks and rich colours. Even under direct sunlight, the display was easy on eyes. You can always choose between different display modes like Vivid or Natural. Everything from consuming multimedia to browsing through social media and gaming, the display is well suited for all tasks. The 120Hz refresh rate sure makes everything smooth and easy on eyes. Even if it takes a toll on battery, it's difficult to back to 60Hz once you see what's at offer. Camera Samsung Galaxy M52 features a triple rear camera, which performs well in ideal situations. The primary sensor is a 64MP, which is then paired with a 12MP ultra-wide lens and a 5MP sensor. Our bet is mostly on the main and secondary sensor, leaving out the macro, which could have been better or even swapped for a depth sensor - like on the M51. The Galaxy M52 produces detailed pictures in broad daylight with good dynamic range, crisp details and natural tones. Even the wide-angle mode captures great deal of details and manages to give a likeable dramatic effect without distorting the edges. Low-light photos do not match the results produced during the day. The night mode brightens the image, but loses the natural colour form. The 32MP front camera clicks rich selfies, both indoors and in sunlight. The wide-angle mode covers a larger area, making group selfies easy. The macro mode struggles to capture details and focusing speed could've been better. The macro mode was unusable in low-light, whereas it managed to produce good results under sunlight.  There are other modes as well, like the Fun mode uses Snapchat filters so you can click images for the sake of fun. The Single Take is a useful mode that captures a moment in more than one ways. The Portrait mode does quite the justice, but works best in well-lit settings. The edge detection could have been better. Below are some of the camera shots straight out of the Galaxy M52 camera roll: Performance and software Samsung Galaxy M52 5G is powered by a mid-range Snapdragon 778G processor, its biggest USP being 5G. The performance was consistent and met our expectations. The apps would load just fine, there was no buffering while switching back and forth between apps and streaming on OTT yielded satisfactory experience. We did notice some frames drop while high-graphics gaming, but that doesn't mean the phone isn't capable of some casual gaming sessions. While many phones these days carry the 5G moniker, Samsung Galaxy M52 seems to be living up to it. Unlike many phones, the M52 offers support for 11 bands of 5G. Some phones go as far as offering just two. When 5G is finally available in India, this feature makes the M52 future-proof. The fingerprint sensor incorporated inside the power button works efficiently, but when pressed, there's an annoying click sound. It doesn't align with the premium nature of the phone. There's also face unlock, but it struggles in low light and not nearly as secure as the biometric security. The OneUI 3.1 still comes with bloatware you might not use, but you can always get rid of them. But everything else about the UI is favouring the users, like the clean interface, deep customisations, ample widgets and more. Battery Samsung Galaxy M52 has a 5,000mAh battery, which may be huge, but is drastically reduced from the predecessor's 7,000mAh size. However, the sleek design makes the size reduction acceptable. The Galaxy M52 5G can last long enough between charges, even by 2021 standards. In fact, it comes very close to Samsung's claims. Our battery life tests were run on 4G+Wi-Fi signals with 120Hz refresh rate and the Galaxy M52 easily got us through the day. With mixed usage, we got one full day's worth of use and still had some juice left at the end of the day. If you're not much of a gamer or movie buff, the smartphone is going to last you two days. As far as battery life is concerned, the Galaxy M52 won't disappoint you. The smartphone comes with an 18W charger in the box and given the size of the battery, it takes its own sweet time to charge the phone. It charges from 0 to 100 percent in just under two hours, which can be quite a test for your patience. But the bigger question is how important is it for the smartphone to last really long. Verdict Samsung Galaxy M52 5G is surely a smartphone that will get you excited. It has a remarkable design and display, cameras are excellent, future-ready 5G bands and the battery life is reliable. The performance of the phone is at par with some rivals, but there are surely better phones out there if you do a lot of gaming. There are some elements that could've made the Galaxy M52 formidable like the 3.5mm headphone jack, IP rating against dust and water protection, better speakers, and faster charging. Since there's an active discount on the Galaxy M52 5G, which saves Rs 4,000 on both models, it surely makes sense to take advantage of the offer while it lasts.","

286,2021-09-29,18:50:34,technology,smartphones,Nokia C20 Plus review: Who is this budget phone really for," Nokia launched its Android Go-edition C20 Plus with an aim to attract budget shoppers as Jio Phone Next launch draws close. Starting at Rs 8,999, the C20 Plus is positioned well in the sub-Rs 10K price range, but also competes with many worthy contenders. The biggest question is does Nokia C20 Plus have what it takes to be the next go-to choice for smartphone buyers in India? Let's find out. Nokia C20 Plus comes in 2GB and 3GB RAM options, priced at Rs 8,999 and Rs 9,999, respectively. Both models have default 32GB onboard storage with a dedicated microSD card slot for further expansion. The handset comes in grey and blue shades, and we received the latter for review purposes. In terms of features, the C20 Plus features a large 6.5-inch HD+ display, dual rear cameras, 4,950mAh battery, Android 11 (Go edition) and Unisoc SC9863A processor. The modest configuration is the first hint towards the phone's capabilities when it comes to demanding tasks. Continue reading to know more. Design and display Nokia phones are known for their durable built and that reflects in every bit of C20 Plus. The smartphone is quite a handful, given its large display and huge battery, which also reflects in weight. For perspective, it weighs 204 grams and has a thickness of 9.35mm. Nokia C20 Plus features a polycarbonate textured back, which offers a nice feel and can take a few drops and knocks. There are rounded corners, designed to offer a level of handling, a back-firing speaker, circular dual-camera module on the back, volume and lock buttons on the right and a 3.5mm headphone jack. It was disappointing to see Nokia went with the aging microUSB port instead of the USB Type-C for charging, which is bound to add some level of inconvenience. Nokia also omitted the dedicated Google Assistant button some of its budget models have and the biometric scanner also didn't make the cut. Moving on to the display, the C20 Plus features a 6.5-inch 720p LCD panel, which naturally comes with 60Hz refresh rate. It's a basic display for a basic phone, so we didn't see any surprises there. The display is good for viewing content, browsing internet and social media, reading and multimedia consumption. It gets tricky when you step out in the sun as the display might not be as bright enough. Camera Nokia C20 Plus features a dual rear camera setup with 8MP primary sensor and a 2MP depth sensor and the front camera has a 5MP sensor. Nokia has gone with a basic setup here, so expecting much out of the cameras would be unfair. The photos captured using the C20 Plus are pretty average, and in some cases drop the bar low. Even in good lighting, the camera struggles with focusing - both in photo and portrait mode. The photos lack details and crispness, however, there's some tuning up of contrast to make them appear attractive. The dedicated depth sensor manages to get the bokeh effect, which is adjustable on the viewfinder, but the details and natural colour tones are amiss. The front camera also produces below-average selfies in low-light and even in good lighting, there's a lot of improvement that's needed. The Nokia C20 Plus is not your ideal smartphone for shooting nightscapes but can do the trick if your reliance on the camera is need-basis. Check out some samples below: Performance Nokia C20 Plus is powered by an entry-level octa-core chipset, clocking peak speeds at 1.6GHz. Even with the 3GB RAM, the performance was limited to basic tasks. As long as your needs are mostly making calls, browsing the internet and using light apps, things will appear smooth. The moment you crank things up, the handset gets sluggish. Switching back and forth between apps isn't a seamless experience, the animations appear stiff and there's a noticeable delay when launching apps, even when they are running in the background. The stock Android experience plays in Nokia's favour here, offering a familiar interface for first-time users. Everything in the phone is pretty straightforward, so you wouldn't be lost in the settings. Nokia has kept things to a bare minimum here, as even the on-device wallpaper is limited to just one. The face unlock works well in lit areas, and struggles in dark rooms, as it normally would. The lack of a fingerprint sensor means you would either need to use a PIN or a pattern lock to keep your data safe. Battery Low configuration and large battery is the perfect recipe for lasting use. Packing a 4,950mAh battery, once fully charged, the Nokia C20 Plus can easily last two days. If you're consuming a lot of multimedia, it is wise to adjust your expectations accordingly. Charging that huge battery is a task that falls in the hands of a 10W adaptor, which can be a test for your patience. It takes more than three hours for the C20 Plus to go from 0-100 percent. The best trick is to recharge the phone without having to wait till the battery is fully drained or charge it at night when there are no tasks. Verdict Nokia C20 Plus is a pretty basic phone for those who do not have demanding tasks to run at all times. The sturdy build and stock Android are still Nokia's strong suits, but it is difficult to rely on these factors when competition is far tougher in 2021. There are plenty of other options in the sub-Rs 10K price range for you to consider, but if you are hell-bent on buying a Nokia phone that doesn't break the bank and you want a simple phone that gets the job done for you, the C20 Plus sure falls in your domain of interest.","

The XPan mode is a reference to the Hasselblad XPan, a rebranded version of the dual-format Fuji TX-1 camera launched in the late 90s, reports GSMArena. Apart from shooting on 35mm film, this camera could also shoot in a wider 65mm format for panoramas in a 65:24 (or 2.7:1) aspect ratio. New XPan mode on OnePlus 9  The XPan mode on the OnePlus 9 series aims to emulate this. Users can launch this mode from the mode selection screen. This brings up a new UI with the 65:25 aspect ratio viewfinder and limited controls, the report said. Users can switch between two colour modes, a slightly tweaked natural colour preset and default black and white mode based on the Ilford Delta 400 film. Users can also switch their focal length from 45mm to a wider 30mm, which switches to the ultra-wide lens. Lastly, they can also control exposure, the report said. When users capture a shot, the screen briefly turns negative as the final image slowly forms and is saved. This is supposed to ""reproduce the ritual sense of film developing"". The 65:25 aspect ratio on these phones cannot be recreated natively, and the images are cropped from their native 4:3 sensor. (With inputs from IANS)","

Meet the new Pro iPhones According to the company, the iPhone 13 Pro lineup features the best camera system ever on iPhone. The all-new Wide camera has a larger sensor with 1.9 um pixels, the largest ever on iPhone, for less noise and faster shutter speeds needed across lighting conditions, producing even more detailed photos. Coupled with the larger f/1.5 aperture, the Wide camera on iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max offers a massive improvement in low-light situations, up to 2.2x when compared to iPhone 12 Pro, and nearly 1.5x when compared to iPhone 12 Pro Max. Sensor-shift optical image stabilization (OIS) - unique to iPhone - is available on both models, stabilizing the sensor instead of the lens, so images are smooth and video is steady, even when the user is not. The new Ultra Wide camera features a much wider f/1.8 aperture and a new autofocus system, bringing a 92 per cent improvement for low-light environments, producing images that are brighter and sharper. Video takes a huge leap forward with Cinematic mode for beautiful depth-of-field transitions, macro video, Time-lapse and Slo-mo, and even better low-light performance. Both models also offer end-to-end pro workflows in Dolby Vision, and for the first time, ProRes, only available on iPhone.

292,2021-09-15,01:03:06,technology,smartphones,Let's talk about iPhone 13 Pro cameras and what's so great about them," Apple finally introduced the all-new iPhone 13 series, comprising of the ever-so-powerful Pro models with advanced cameras, super-fast chips, lasting battery and more. Here we are diving deep into the cameras of the new flagships, which Apple claims are the biggest advancement made in its camera system. For those unaware, the iPhone 13 Pro and the iPhone 13 Pro Max sport triple camera setup, featuring a 77mm telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom, an ultra wide camera with ƒ/1.8 aperture and wide camera with ƒ/1.5 aperture. According to Apple, the new sensors massively improve low-light performance. But there's more to the humble triple camera setup than meets the eye. Pro cameras for Pro iPhones Apple claims the new camera setup is better and more advanced. If the virtual presentation was anything to go by, the iPhone-maker might have outdone itself. Here's why: The new Wide camera has 1.9 µm pixels and f/1.5 aperture, which guarantees lower noise in pictures shot in low light. In fact, Apple says the low-light performance is almost 2x better than its predecessors. Apple has retained its celebrated sensor-shift OIS, which makes all the difference in the videos shot using the new iPhones. Apple's Ultra Wide camera has an f/1.8 aperture, which also allows more light. Apple says it brings a 92 percent improvement for low-light environments. But the one camera feature Apple has missed all these years is also here with the new iPhone Pro models, and it's macro photography, which lets you close in on your subjects at just 2cm distance while capturing great details. It's not a feature we missed, but the fact that macro is supported on Slo-Mo and Time-lapse modes makes all the difference. As for the 77mm Telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom lets you really bring out those portraits to life. Apple has generously added its night mode to all three lenses, so all those noisy pictures are a thing of the past. In a first, Apple brings an interesting Cinematic mode, which truly brings out the cinematographer inside you. The rack focus works like a charm as it automatically (and smartly) shifts focus like a professional filmmaker. The Pro iPhones also allow users to change the focus after the video has been shot, so you don't have to regret any moment. Above all, the Cinematic mode records in Dolby Vision HDR, which is enabled by Apple's all-new 5nm A15 Bionic. Finally, Apple's new iPhone 13 Pro brings new photographic styles that apply different adjustments across scenes and subject types. This allows you to set your favourite visual effect and maintain the same across shots.","

295,2021-09-13,21:35:46,technology,smartphones,Oppo Reno6 Pro review: There's a lot of goodness inside and out," Oppo Reno6 Pro was recently launched in India as a premium mid-range offering for those who are looking for a balanced phone - that looks great, feels great. Oppo has hit the sweet spot when it comes to pricing, one that is quite popular and highly competitive. At Rs 39,990, Oppo Reno6 Pro brings in several pro-elements but does it really check all the boxes needed to be the most desired phone in 2021. Let's find out. Here's a quick look at the Reno6 Pro's features: Display: 6.55-inch Full HD+ AMOLED, 90Hz refresh rate CPU: MediaTek Dimension 1200 5G RAM: 12GB Storage: 256GB Camera: 64MP+8MP+2MP+2MP Selfie Cam: 32MP Battery: 4,500mAh Given these specs, the mid-ranger Oppo smartphone makes quite an impression. Let's dive deeper into how it performs in the real world. Design and display Oppo Reno6 Pro perfectly fuses elegance and bling in a 7.6mm chassis. The sleek glass back has a matte gradient finish, which looks great even with a transparent case on it. The smooth matte keeps fingerprint smudges at bay, which gives a clean look and saves the trouble of cleaning it often. The sleek glass sandwich design, with its metallic sides, gives a comfortable grip and single-hand use is made easy. The smartphone is also non-slippery, but it's better to use the transparent case that comes with it. The rear panel has a 3D Oppo logo at the lower right hand side and the camera module on the top left, which is a slim profile and doesn't protrude much. The power button is on the right with a green line on it, which looks nice. On the left are the volume controls, which are easily accessible. The bottom part is occupied by the USB Type-C port, SIM card tray and speaker grille. Interesting aspect of the design is the radium on the top side, which glows in dark. This makes finding the phone easy in the dark. On the front is a 6.5-inch Full HD+ AMOLED display, which is curved on the sides to give a true edge-to-edge form factor but it registered some accidental touches. There's a small punch hole for the front camera, which is barely noticeable and doesn't get in the way. The screen is quite bright and visibility was never an issue, even under direct sunlight. Overall, the Reno6 Pro brings the best design in the segment and a display that meets the industry requirement. Cameras Oppo Reno6 Pro packs four cameras on the back, featuring 64MP primary f/1.7 aperture lens paired with 8MP f/2.2 aperture and 120-degree lens and two 2MP sensors — one for macro and the other for monochrome. On the front is a 32MP f/2.4 26mm wide camera, which takes care of all your selfie needs. We tested the different camera modes in various settings to see how the phone performed. Overall, the results were satisfactory and met our expectations. In good lighting, the phone managed to capture a lot of detail and the colours retained a natural tone. Even the wide-angle shots were acceptable with a few noticeable warping around the edges. The macro lens takes a while to focus, and tends to lose details. The night mode did come in handy while shooting in the dark as it managed to retain details and eliminate noise to a large extent. But the primary sensor came out victorious of all the lenses, making it our go-to choice for shooting. The selfie camera performed extremely well and manages to capture good details and natural colours. There's AI beautification that works as advertised, if that is to your liking. The portrait mode, on both front and rear cameras, manages to add a soft bokeh by blurring the background - even in the backdrop of direct sunlight. Here are a few camera samples: Performance Oppo Reno6 Pro is powered by a 6nm-architecture MediaTek Dimensity 1200 chipset, which comes with 5G support. The review unit we have come with 12GB RAM and 256GB storage, which is ample. The on-paper specs are just as good as in a real-world use case. The Reno6 Pro can handle all the big and small tasks with ease. Running games like Asphalt 9 and Call of Duty Mobile with high graphics settings did not render any issues, but the frames did drop while playing Call of Duty. The Reno6 Pro might not have the best benchmark scores, but the real-world use-case scenario doesn't reflect that. We did not encounter any crashes or heating issues, even with extended use. Day-to-day tasks like calls, messaging, social media browsing, etc can be done easily. Multimedia consumption is also done with ease and has a good Wi-Fi range. The fingerprint scanner and face unlock work effeciently and they are extremely fast, as they should be. Battery Oppo Reno6 Pro packs a sizeable 4,500mAh battery, which comes with a super-fast 65W fast charger. Thanks to this, the smartphone fully charges in under an hour. Even with a 30-minute charging, the phone can last a day of low-to-moderate use. For powerful use, you will need to plug your phone in after a full day's worth of use. The battery life on the Reno6 Pro might not be the best out there, but the 65W charger sure makes things easy for users. Verdict Oppo Reno6 Pro 5G has many things going in its favour. With an incredible design, reliable performance, 65W fast charging, good cameras, 5G support, and a refined UI, the Reno6 Pro balances the offerings. However, the competition in the sub-Rs 40K segment is incredibly tough, making the Reno6 Pro struggle to keep up with the rivals' offerings. The smartphone misses a few features like stereo speakers, wireless charging, and water resistance, and if you're okay with that then the Reno6 Pro is a worthy choice.","

296,2021-09-12,15:18:12,technology,smartphones,Bikes and iPhones don't fare well; Apple warns bikers of degrading camera performance [read now]," Apple has warned iPhone users that the cameras on their devices can be damaged by exposure to certain vibrational frequencies such as those generated by high-power motorcycle engines. iPhone camera lenses with optical image stabilisation (OIS) or closed-loop autofocus (AF) are susceptible to this damage due to their use of gyroscopes and/or magnetic sensors to help compensate for movement and vibration when shooting photos or video. According to MacRumors, the OIS and closed-loop AF systems in iPhone are designed for durability. What's the risk, its cause? However, as is the case with many consumer electronics that include systems like OIS, long-term direct exposure to high-amplitude vibrations within certain frequency ranges may degrade the performance of these systems and lead to reduced image quality for photos and videos. It is recommended to avoid exposing your iPhone to extended high-amplitude vibrations, the report said. Due to this risk, Apple recommends that users not attach their iPhones directly to the chassis or handlebars of such motorcycles, as the direct transmission of vibrations can be intense. Apple even recommends that users mounting their devices to lower-powered devices like mopeds and electric scooters at least use a vibration-dampening mount to minimise the chances of any damage.

303,2021-07-15,17:00:33,technology,tablets,Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 Lite review: For online classes and beyond [should you buy]," Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic struck the world, there have been some major lifestyle changes. Our homes became offices and schools all the same, with working professionals taking their meetings in front of a laptop and students trying to concentrate in a digital classroom. The pandemic happened all of a sudden and new ways had to be adopted in order to survive these changing times. It is natural people were without necessary resources, required to work from home or take online classes. If the latter is still a concerning matter, there's something worth checking out. Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 Lite was recently launched as an affordable tablet, trying to live up to the requirements of education and entertainment. The new tablet comes in two models, Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi+LTE, which are priced at Rs 11,999 and Rs 14,999, respectively. The tablet comes with 3GB RAM and 32GB expandable storage. Here's a look at what works in the favour of the Galaxy Tab A7 Lite and what doesn't. Design and Display Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 Lite is a compact tablet with a Samsung-esque minimalistic design. For a tablet, it can be handled with one hand as it is quite light. Our review unit was a Grey shade, but there's also a Silver one if that's more suited to your taste. Taking cues from the Samsung Tab family, the Galaxy A7 Lite is an elegant looking model with flat sides. On the plastic rear panel are Samsung's logo at the centre and the rear camera on the top left corner. At the bottom, there's a USB Type-C port for charging and a 3.5mm headphone jack. You can also find speakers at the bottom and at the top as well, which means it is designed for multimedia consumption when the tab is facing landscape orientation. The power and volume controls are on the top right side, which might not be as easy to reach while holding the tablet in the same hand. The display on the Tab A7 Lite is an 8.7-inch TFT display with 1340x800 WXGA+ pixels. For indoor use, we found the display to be quite great. We primarily used it for video conferencing, online classes and multimedia consumption, all of which seem to be handled with ease. The display is bright and rich in colour and usable even outdoors, all prepared to be used once the pandemic is history. Overall, the design and display of the Tab A7 Lite are best suited for the masses given the current reliance on digital modes of communication and entertainment. Performance The Galaxy Tab A7 Lite is powered by a humble MediaTek Helio P22T processor, which is paired with 3GB RAM and 32GB onboard storage. The spec sheet itself should be enough to set your expectations light. If you're looking at playing CoD or PUBG games, this might not be the best tablet out there. However, simple games like Candy Crush, Ludo are more like it. Our usage with the Tab A7 Lite was mainly limited to the consumption of media, taking online meetings/classes, social media and internet browsing and some mild gaming. As long as you do not push the limits, the tablet will work just fine throughout the day. And if you have a Samsung household - the Tab A7 Lite fits right in. The tablet, despite being affordable, has Knox security, so taking those important emails and editing some assignments while picking out your groceries is without concern. With tablet had both Wi-Fi and LTE and both seem to work as promised. We were mostly connected to Wi-Fi during the review period. The dual speakers with Dolby Atmos are a nice touch. Watching your favourite TV shows and movies without earphones fills the room with its audio, good enough to be viewed by two or three people when comfortably snuggled in. The limited storage on the device is a major letdown, but there's 1TB storage expansion, so it's not all a dead-end. The rear 8MP camera is good enough and mostly came in handy to click photos of documents, take quick pictures of projects and homework. As for the front camera with a 2MP sensor, it is primarily for video calls and not so much for selfies. Phones do a far better job at that. Battery The Galaxy Tab A7 Lite is packing a 5,100mAh battery with 15W Adaptive Fast Charging. The monstrous battery easily lasts a day with mixed usage, but the only solution to fully charge the tablet is by leaving it plugged in to the charger overnight. With 7+ hours of screen on time, your kid can finish the online class, you can catch up on your shows and even get-together for some light games like Ludo. Pros Cons Who is the tablet for? Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 Lite is for both students and working professionals. For students, it can be a good investment as it is priced low and configured to do just as much. For professionals, it is a good device to take you away from your laptop and smartphone to catch up on your TV shows or some new flicks. Samsung has the price advantage here and the long-lasting battery is surely a boon. Don't expect the goodness of Samsung's high-end tablets or even compare it to an iPad. The Galaxy Tab A7 Lite is for those who cannot afford either. It's a good way to jump the tablet bandwagon if you really must.","

305,2020-10-25,23:38:35,technology,tablets,Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 review: Affordable tablet that meets family needs," Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 joins the company's expansive tablet portfolio but targeted towards budget shoppers. Priced at Rs 17,999 for the Wi-Fi model and Rs 21,999 for the 4G variant, the Galaxy Tab A7 presents a suitable option for those who are looking for an affordable tablet for all entertainment and education needs. With schools shut, schools have opted for online classes and it makes perfect sense to invest in a reliable tablet for your kid (class 1 till class 10) and Samsung has just the device. The Galaxy Tab A7 carries Samsung's brand trust and signature design, which is quite appealing. We've covered the design aspect of the tablet in our first impressions and after having used the tablet on and off for over two weeks, it looks like the tablet for masses. Samsung Galaxy Tab A7's metallic back, sleek design rounded corners and minimalistic form factor makes it casually fit for all your needs that cannot be fulfilled on your smartphone. The 10.4-inch display is bright enough to make sure you don't miss out on the action even on-the-go. But if you're looking for domestic use for things like online classes and binge-watching your favorite shows, Tab A7 is more than capable to satisfy your needs. Those bezels around the display are hard to ignore, but we found them to be useful to hold the tablet without any mistouch. For the sake of comparison, the Tab A7's display is far from its higher-end sibling - the Tab S7, which is too good in every way but for a price. After all, the Tab A7 packs an LCD display, which is bright but don't start counting those pixels and color accuracies while watching high-def content. What we found quite useful in Tab A7 is the fact that there are four speakers, two on each side. Whether you're watching content on Netflix and Amazon Prime Video or taking online classes, the Tab A7 is loud enough to be used without earphones in a quiet room. But you can always plug your good-old earphones with the 3.5mm jack for concentration during online classes. During our time with Tab A7, where we used it for binge-watching TV shows on OTT platforms and did a few video calls to catch up with family and friends, it handled the tasks pretty well. There's a Snapdragon 662 processor paired with 3GB RAM, 32GB onboard storage with microSD card support. It's a decent configuration, but we felt the integrated storage was at least 64GB even with the microSD card slot. The tablet even came in handy for some productive use, for instance typing out some quick articles or taking notes and simply scribble some art to keep the Picasso in me alive. The OneUI 2.1 based on Android 10 is a clean interface for tablets, which we loved in the Tab S7 as well. You will get used to it in no time, and your kids won't have trouble either.  The tablet also packs an 8MP sensor, which we rarely found any use for besides scanning documents. Even if you can get comfortable holding up that huge tablet against people's faces in public, we'd recommend your smartphone camera for better results. Finally, the Galaxy Tab A7 has a massive 7,040mAh battery, which can last days depending on your usage. If the tablet is used by a school kid, chances are the battery would need a recharge every night. That is due to not just online classes, but occasional gaming and a lot of toons and funny cat videos on YouTube. We tracked the tablet's battery life to easily deliver 6+ screen on time. The battery lasted more in our case, when we had to use it for productive purposes such as checking emails, social networking, editing articles on the go, creating images using Canva, editing photos and watching work-related videos. Doing all this without facing any lags made the Galaxy Tab A7 more than just your kid's gadget. You can even borrow it for your professional use when you are lazy to fetch your laptop while watching TV with your family. Verdict The question you must be really asking is whether this tablet is worth buying. Given the current pandemic, we'd say the Galaxy Tab A7 is a good investment. It may be marketed as a multimedia device, it comes in handy for work and some educational use for your kids. It's perfect to be shared in a small family. You can do some basic work stuff, wifey can make some delicacies watching those Masterchef videos, kids can be left unattended after playing some of their favorite toons or everyone can catch a movie together cozying up in the bed just before hitting the rack. For Rs 17,999, the Wi-Fi model is a solid investment. Then again, for just Rs 3,000 more, you get a 4G model, which you can carry around that is if you are stepping out these days. We wish the tablet had at least 64GB storage, the bezels were slimmer and the battery charging really didn't take 4+ hours. But we have to settle somewhere if the cost of the tablet is kept on the affordable side. ","

306,2020-10-07,19:08:12,technology,tablets,Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 first impressions: Your entertainment companion," The tablet market has some strong players despite Apple's dominance. Samsung is a crucial player that has made sure to make its presence felt despite stiff competition. After showing its capabilities to deliver a premium, best-in-class tablet - the Galaxy Tab S7, Samsung is making sure the customers are not at a loss of options by launching the Galaxy Tab A7. Priced at Rs 17,999, Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 is looking to tap into the budget segment. The target audience can be anyone from students taking online classes to anyone who needs a spare large-screen device to carry out entertainment needs and for anyone who simply doesn't want to burn a hole through the pocket over a tablet. There's also a 4G LTE variant for Rs 21,999, but that comes in handy in case you're willing to carry the tablet wherever you go. We received the Tab A7 for review and here's what our initial thoughts are of the device. Design Samsung Galaxy Tab A7's USP is the design. It's sleek and compact even for a 10.4-inch tablet. But the looks can be deceiving as it feels a tad heavy while trying to operate with single-hand. It weighs 476grams. After seeing the Tab S7, the Tab A7 feels outdated, but looking at the budget, it seems fitting. Samsung has gone with a traditional design. The Galaxy Tab A7 is playing it safe, the logo takes a prominent spot on the back, the single-camera lens sits on the top right corner in landscape mode and the volume and power buttons sit just on the top. There's a USB Type-C port alongside the speakers and there are two more on the opposite side. There's also a 3.5mm headphone just in case you wish to plug those earphones in. But we felt the loudspeakers were sufficed for most of the talks, including watching movies and TV shows. Display The 10.4-inch display comes with 2000x1200 resolution with thick bezels surrounding. It's a bit old-school. But the display is generously bright so you don't have to struggle to view under direct sunlight. The display can also get dim in case you want to catch up on your shows without waking up your partner in the room. Apps, UI and more Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 has a familiar interface as it runs One UI. You'll easily get accustomed to it right from the time you take the tablet out of the box. There are some pre-loaded apps such as Netflix, Google and Microsoft apps to cater to your essential needs expected from a tablet. But the Galaxy Tab A7 has only 32GB onboard storage, which many will find it to be too low. But there's an option to expand using microSD card up to 1TB, but nothing beats the convenience of integrated storage. The 8MP rear camera is helpful to scan documents and the 5MP front snapper will fulfil your video-calling needs. Surprisingly, there's no LED flash on the back, so you may need to rely on ambient lighting. The Tab A7 is powered by an octa-core processor with 3GB RAM onboard. We are not betting huge on the performance besides day-to-day use. There's a 7,040mAh battery with 15W fast charging support, but it can take its own sweet time. But anything is better than standard 10W. Stay tuned for more in-depth analysis of how things are in our detailed review.","

307,2020-09-29,20:43:31,technology,tablets,"Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 Review: Insanely powerful, incredibly productive"," When we talk about premium tablets, Apple's iPads are the first to come to mind. But as times are changing and tablets are evolving, competition is getting fierce. Apple might be the front-runner in the tablet space, but it won't be for long if tablets like Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 continue to flourish the market. Samsung has truly developed a thought-provoking device that challenges the usual limitations fo what a tablet can do. Let's explore. Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 really ups the ante in the tablet genre. We've been testing the tablet for a while now and it has everything one might be looking for - but at a cost. Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 starts at Rs 55,999 for the Wi-Fi variant and the LTE variant will cost Rs 63,999. The keyboard cover price costs an extra Rs 15,999. Since the competing alternative is iPad Pro, it starts at Rs 71,900 for the 11-inch model and depending on the storage model, it can cost you as high as Rs 1,16,900. So it's basically the question of which tablet makes more sense to buy given they both don't come cheap. Design and Display One of the best tablet designs adorns the Galaxy Tab S7. From that premium aluminum body to a vibrant 11-inch display with minimal bezels, the Samsung tablet is a visual delight. The curved corners, sleek build makes it ideal to hold and work with it. But the beauty lies in the details. The dual camera on the back with a continued magnetic strip stretching horizontally holds the S-Pen securely. The S-Pen camouflages very well in that strip. The sturdy build makes for excellent rough handling. But we also had Samsung's keyboard cover, which protected it against any accidental drops or scratches. It's the best accessory you can get for the S7 - complete with a stand, secure S-Pen holder and a keyboard, all of it attaches to the tablet magnetically so there are no scratches while removing or attaching it. But that's not even the best part. The display, as is the case with every premium Samsung devices, is absolutely desirable. The bezels are thin, uniform and do not disrupt visuals in any way. The 11-inch WQXGA LTPS TFT LCD display brings content to life and those 4K and 8K videos are absolutely stunning. The 120Hz makes those visuals go so smooth, you'll have to see it to believe it. From games to high-res videos and simply scrolling through social media feeds, one cannot go back from that extra smooth 120Hz. The quad speakers tuned with AKG and Dolby are positioned well on the sides, so when you want to stream movies or TV shows without your earphones, they suffice. The audio is clear, loud and you won't miss out on anything even in a mildly noisy room. So if you're narrating the scenes for your partner, the S7's audio won't be muffled. Samsung has also placed the fingerprint sensor into the lock button on the top right side, alongside the volume controls. The USB Type-C is placed at the bottom. Performance Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 is powered by Snapdragon 865 Plus octa-core processor with Adreno 650 graphics. Though there are many variants, out review unit packed 6GB RAM and 128GB expandable storage. It also runs Android 10-based OneUI 2.5 has some nifty features onboard. From the time we started using the tablet right up until this moment, we never faced any issues, glitches or lags. Apps would load in record time, smooth and easy, high-graphics apps would run with ease, productivity apps worked flawlessly - overall it is made for day-to-day use and some fun. The large display makes it great for using multiple apps at the same time. We normally ran two, but in case you wish to add another, it won't be a problem. We loved playing car games on this more than battle-royal titles such as CoD and Fortnite, simply because of the sheer size of the screen. If you can get around that, it can handle those games like a pro. There are many pre-loaded apps, for once, we found them all to be of great use. Samsung Notes has this feature called Audio Bookmark to record lectures while taking notes. It was perfect for our weekly meetings. The Clip Studio Paint came in handy not just to scribble but also to make some important drawings. Speaking of art, Penup made it easy to work with S-Pen, which by the way is better and more accurate. There are some customizable air gestures with the S-Pen, which worked great. The best part is the S-Pen is a part of the tablet, which comes in the box for free. Even though we haven't always been a fan of OneUI, our views changed using Samsung's proprietary OS on the Galaxy Tab S7. The Tab S7's performance is basically as good as it gets. DeX We are totally sold on the idea that Tab S7 can be perfect to replace your laptop on-the-go. It is easier to carry than a MacBook, and the full-size keyboard with trackpad allowed us to go about our workday. But an attachable keyboard cannot do all the work of a laptop. It needs a suitable OS and in Samsung's case, there's DeX. In all fairness, the seamless switching between Dex and tablet-mode made us go wow. As soon as you attach the keyboard, the Tab S7 switches to DeX mode to get all productive. The interface instantly switches to give you a desktop-like feel and that's one advantage over the iPad Pro. If you pay for the Microsoft 365 suite, it can be ideal to switch from your laptop for most of your tasks. Battery life There's a generous 8,000mAh battery onboard. There's also 45W fast-charging support even though the tablet comes with a 15W charger in the box. But it's not a bad thing. Once fully charged, the tablet can easily last a full day and that includes switching back and forth between the tablet and the laptop, browsing the internet on Wi-Fi, and binge-watching shows (a lot of it). You will not be disappointed by the battery life on the Galaxy Tab S7. Camera The 13MP + 5MP rear cameras do a decent job and the 8MP front camera is ideal for video-conferencing in HD quality. We didn't quite use the tablet for taking pictures, but the samples we took showed its decent capabilities. But it's perfect for scanning documents, which is the only practical use we found for the tablet's camera. The Tab S7 not ready to replace your phone as much as it is ready to take over your laptop. But we were absolutely in awe while watching the photos shot on the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. It made us fall in love with that big bright display all over again. Verdict Besides the point that we missed typing with two thumbs on the Tab S7 (yes not even the Plus, which is humongous), and having used the tablet as an extension of the phone, it's still perfect. The Tab S7 can almost convince you to replace your laptop. By far, this is the best tablet Samsung has ever made and one that can finally be pitted against the best of iPad. It has some strong USPs such as that beautiful display for binge-watching (provided you're not holding it in your hand the entire time), beastly performance, buttery smooth UI, and a battery that keeps things going for a whole workday. We frankly couldn't ask for more, and it's hard not to recommend the Tab S7 to any prospect buyers looking for a full package.","

Do you often charge your phone, tablet or computer device in public kiosks? Then your devices are at great risk, as they may be infected with malware, hacked, or your data may be stolen. There are several ways of stealing data or infecting your phone, tablet, or computer device with malware. Juice jacking is a kind of cyber attack and hackers can steal your data through a charging port especially over USB. The hacker may either install malware or copy sensitive data from your electronic device. American journalist Brian Krebs, who is known for his coverage of profit-seeking cybercriminals, first used the term juice jacking in 2011 after a proof of concept was conducted at DEF CON by Wall of Sheep. The informational juice jacking kiosks were installed to create awareness of this attack on the general public. When users plugged their phones into a free charging station, a message appeared on the kiosk screen saying, ""You should not trust public kiosks with your smartphone. Information can be retrieved or downloaded without your consent. Luckily for you, this station has taken the ethical route and your data is safe. Enjoy the free charge!"" You are at an airport, hotel, or shopping mall, or any other public place. The battery of your smartphone, tablet, or laptop is about to die. You don't have a power bank and you spot a free charging kiosk, you need to think twice before connecting your devices to the unknown charging port that could be configured to read your data or upload malware to your device. You need to beware of juice jacking as attackers will make use of public charging ports to install malware to steal data or even to take complete control over your device.","

311,2019-04-10,14:26:00,technology,tablets,3-year-old's dad shares typical parent problem on Twitter: Gets hilarious responses," Kids can be curious and are not afraid of trying something they have no idea about, even if it brings failure several times. Such was the case of a Washington DC-based journalist's 3-year-old toddler, who did not give up easily on trying to unlock an iPad, which eventually stopped accepting the PIN and disabled the tablet from taking further PIN entries for a long (very long) time. Apple's stringent security is one of the biggest reasons why people trust and buy iPhones and iPads. But that very security feature worked against Evan Osnos, a staff writer at The New Yorker, who found out his 3-year-old locked him out of his iPad for 25,536,442 minutes until he can type in the right code to regain access. That's a long, long time and practically impossible to wait. Doing the math, 25,536,442 minutes are equivalent to 48.59 years, which means Osnos will have to try accessing his iPad again by late 2067, the NY Daily News reported on Monday. Osnos sought help from the geniuses on Twitter by sharing a post with a photograph of the disabled iPad. ""Uh, this looks fake but, alas, it's our iPad today after 3-year-old tried (repeatedly) to unlock. Ideas?"" Osnos tweeted. As the tradition goes, Osnos' problem attracted some witty responses. One user suggested ""Time travel seems to be your best bet,"" while another one suggested, ""next time just give the kid the passcode."" With so much wisdom being shared on Osnos' post, some responses actually included guides from various articles that give instructions on how to restore a disabled iPad. Reboot your 3 y.o. Time travel seems to be your best bet. That’s a well documented issue. Solutions here: https://t.co/NOFNVUYKj7 Two days later, following a mix of witty responses and useful tips, Osnos shared an update on his ""toddler-iPad-lock-out"" issue. ""Got it into DFU mode (don't hold down the sleep/power button too long or you end up in recovery). Now restoring. Thanks to those who shared advice!"" It's not clear if the trick worked, but those who are experiencing similar problems can try out these steps instead of being subjected to smugly responses from the free netizens of the world. How to restore access to disabled iPad/iPhone/iPod? Victims of a locked out iOS device can try one of two steps to restore access to their precious device. The first method is to restore the device via iTunes, which works best if you've taken a recent iTunes back of your device on the computer. Alternatively, users can reset the device to start fresh and lose all that data. In order to restore an iPad via iTunes, one must connect the iOS device to the computer, launch iTunes, restore the last back on the iPad/iPhone and sit back while the installation completes. Once the restoration is complete, the iOS device should work normally. The second method is to get your locked iPhone or iPad into Recovery Mode to try resetting the device. If that doesn't work, enter DFU mode to reset it as a new device. All your data will be lost. This incident is a good reminder to back up your iOS device using iTunes on your computer.","

312,2019-04-10,07:19:00,technology,tablets,WhatsApp for iPad is finally happening after all these years: Everything you can do," WhatsApp is by far the best cross-platform instant messaging application and serves more than a billion users across the world, making it the largest app in its category. The ease of use, multitude of features, ad-free experience and availability across all platforms makes it the number one choice for smartphone and tablet users. While WhatsApp has been available on Android and iOS platforms for years now, iPad users were not considered lucky to use the app on Apple tablets. Those who own an iPad understand the pain of not being able to use the most popular messaging application in the world, but that could soon change. WABetaInfo spotted WhatsApp for iOS v2.19.40 with references for WhatsApp for iPad. The report reveals that WhatsApp is in advanced stages of releasing the app for iPads, which crushes previous rumours indicating a WhatsApp web client instead of an individual app. Once WhatsApp for iPad officially arrives, it will share the interface with its iPhone counterpart, only bigger and with the ease of using redesigned split screen and landscape mode support. Even the app settings can be navigated in the new split screen view. This will be a major overhaul and welcoming news for millions of iPad users who have requested official support for several years. WhatsApp for iPad will also support audio and video calls, WhatsApp Stickers, and support for Touch ID and Face ID depending on the model of the iPad. WhatsApp recently started supporting Touch ID and Face ID authentication, adding an extra layer for protection to users on iOS-powered devices. But WhatsApp is yet to reveal the release date for its iPad version of the app. WhatsApp for iPad is still under development, but the WABetaInfo is assuming the beta release is expected to take place within weeks followed by public rollout upon successful testing. WhatsApp is constantly rolling out new features to improve the user experience. Users recently got the option to block frequently forwarded messages, decline group invites and more. In the wake of Lok Sabha elections, WhatsApp introduced features like a hotline to curb fake news and also started a campaign to fight fake news spread.","

It can entertain you with rich viewing experience, graphics-heavy gaming capability, help you do video editing seamlessly, and even assist you to do office work such as presentation for a client through a plethora of iOS apps including Microsoft Office suite of utility apps if you want. It comes in sizes 11.0-inch and a 12.9-inch screen with True Tone displays. Under-the-hood, the new iPad Pro (review) comes packed with a 12MP primary camera with F1.8 aperture, a 7MP FaceTime front camera, a 7nm class 8-core A12X Bionic Fusion chipset, which is said to be more powerful compared to A12 Bionic seen in iPhone XS and XR series. The former comes with 64-bit class desktop architecture and comes integrated with 7-core GPU, M12 coprocessor and dedicated Neural Engine, which can perform more than 5 trillion operations per second. The benchmark scores have surfaced online revealing that Apple's new iPad Pro is more powerful than top-end laptops in the market. The new iPad Pro series price ranges between Rs 71,900 to Rs 1,71,900 in India (full price list below). Apple iPhone XS, XS Max or iPhone XR: Apple's latest iPhone XS (& XS Max) and the iPhone XR come with proprietary A12 Bionic and is the most advanced and powerful chipset for mobile in the industry. The benchmark scores are way ahead of all rival Android phones and even with a software update, they will never come close with in terms of performance at least until the first quarter of 2019. I have used all the three Apple mobiles and mighty impressed with all the aspects. I never faced any lagging issue whatsoever be it while playing graphics-intense games, Augmented Reality(AR) apps or and any power-intensive apps. Even the camera features such as the adjustable depth control, Slo-mo video recording and stereo video recording and playback are magical. Now, with the release of iOS 12.1, users can make real-time depth control while taking the portrait mode photos, the smooth blur effect transformation of the background and the subject in the front is mesmerising. Also, e-SIM for Dual-SIM functionality is also now live for Reliance Jio and Airtel in India. Consumers can just to respective retail store and fill some formal application and within few hours it will be activated. In terms of build quality, Apple has done a remarkable job. It has used ultra-premium surgical grade steel frame around the edges for the iPhone XS and the XS Max and for the iPhone XR, it has incorporated impressive aerospace aluminium material. All the models come with superior quality glass on top of the display and on the back offering stunning look to the mobiles. All the three Apple mobile models—the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max and the iPhone XR—are available with up to Rs 10,000 discount on several authorised brick-and-mortar retail shops. E-commerce firms are offering more cash back, in addition to lucrative exchange deals. MacBook Air (2018): The MacBook Air sports a 13.3-inch (diagonal) LED-backlit Retina display with 2560x1600p resolutions and 300 nits brightness. It has a smaller footprint, as it takes up 17% less volume, is 10% thinner measuring just .61 inches at its thickest point, and at just 2.75 pounds (1.24Kg) is a quarter pound lighter than the previous generation. Under-the-hood, it houses eighth generation Intel dual-core Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost up to 3.6GHz CPU speed, Intel UHD Graphics 617, 8GB RAM, 128GB/256GB, macOS Mojave and 50.3 watt-hours lithium-polymer battery with support for the 30W USB-C power adapter. Apple claims that the new PC will offer battery life up to 12 hours wireless web browsing and close to 13 hours iTunes movie playback. It also supports two Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports, 802.11 ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2 wireless technology, FaceTime HD camera, full-sized backlit keyboard with Force Touch trackpad. The interesting aspect of the new Apple MacBook Air is eco-friendly. Its body is made of custom, Apple-designed aluminium alloy that enables the use of 100% recycled aluminium for the first time, which has the same strength, durability and beautiful finish as the aluminium in all Apple products. Using this custom aluminium alloy helps reduce MacBook Air's carbon footprint by nearly 50 percent, making it the greenest Mac ever, Apple claims. The new MacBook (2018) is available in India with prices starting at Rs 1,14,900. Apple AirPods: Apple AirPods series very distinct compared to rival brands in the market. It comes with the company's proprietary W1 chip, which is designed to receive the signal independently to both the earpieces. On the other hand, wireless earphones offered by competitors, only one among the two ear pods receive a direct signal from the media player, while the second one receives the audio from the primary earpiece. Apple AirPods boasts optical sensors and accelerometers that work with the Apple's in-house built W1 chip to detect when earphones are in your ear, so they only play when you are ready to listen. If the user removes the AirPods, the iPhone automatically pause the music. Users can also access Siri by double tapping the AirPods to select and control the music, change the volume, check your battery life or perform any other Siri task. With an additional accelerometer in each AirPod, it intuitively knows if the user is speaking, enabling a pair of beam-forming microphones to focus on the sound of your voice, filtering out external noise to make your voice clearer. Another noteworthy attribute of the AirPods is its ultra-low power consumption. Apple W1 chip operates at one-third of the power of traditional wireless chips, enabling the AirPods to deliver up to 5 hours of listening time on one full charge. The custom-designed charging case holds additional charge of more than 24 hours of total listening time, ensuring AirPods are charged and ready to go anytime. It costs Rs 12,900. Apple TV 4K: It comes with an Apple A10X Fusion chipset. And as the name suggests, it supports 4K content support and that too in HDR (High Dynamic Range) 10 Dolby Vision, which promises the highest standard of image/video quality on television. It also can automatically optimize the television's setup for the best quality picture and the 4K TV owners can pick and choose 60 services and also be able to invoke Siri via voice command to find your favourite TV shows or movies or live sporting event. Furthermore, Apple TV owners can also get live sporting updates or set reminders to catch the game on their Apple Watch [this feature will be made available via software update in coming months] Apple TV owners can also be control multiple wireless Bluetooth speakers via AirPlay 2 update coming soon. And also, Apple TV will soon be able to act as a smart home hub, which will allow owners to control ACs, lights and more (HomeKit accessories) in the smart connected house.","

318,2018-12-14,15:58:20,technology,tablets,Flipkart teaser hints at Microsoft Surface Go India launch: Quick facts," Microsoft Surface Go was rumoured to debut in August in India, instead, the company launched only the top-end Surface Book 2 series.

319,2018-12-07,16:52:36,technology,tablets,Apple iPad Pro (2018) review: Almost–ready to replace your laptop," Apple began 2018 with the launch of the new iPad (6th gen) with Pencil support, a first for its generic tablet series and followed it up with the new line of iPhones and Watches in September. At the fag-end of the year, Apple saved the best for last, as it unveiled the new iPad Pro along with the  MacBook Air and Mac mini.  The new iPad Pro (2018) boasts an iPhone X-inspired edge-to-edge design and it also comes with big upgrades internally. I have been using Apple's new tablet for close to a week now and here's what I think. Design, display and build quality Like the iPhone X (review), which brought the biggest design changes in the iPhone portfolio in years, the iPad Pro (2018) brings forth a breath of fresh air to the iPad series. The new Apple tablet comes with a fully revamped sleek and premium design. I received the top-end iPad Pro 12.9 and Its Liquid Retina screen is so much better and with no notch and a big edge-to-edge design, it is beautiful to look at. Also, the viewing experience is many times better than on the iPhone XR (review). [Note: 11.0-inch model, except for screen size, has the same design and internal hardware as seen in the 12.9-inch variant] First thing I did after loading the iPad Pro is to launch Amazon Prime Video and watch high-resolution movies and it was a delightful experience. All thanks to Apple's ProMotion technology which automatically adjusts the display to the movement of on-screen content. It offers refresh rates of up to 120Hz for smooth scrolling, greater responsiveness, and fluid motion. I don't think, I will use puny mobile screens to watch videos, especially from multimedia streaming services anytime soon. Also, I only recently received an e-book reader from another brand for review and was starting to like reading on it. For curiosity sake, I tried to read on the iPad Pro as well. How it went you ask? To cut to the chase, I am now addicted to Apple's tablet. I have to confess though, I underwent an eye surgery (both left and right) for Keratoconus and am very sensitive to light and have been advised to reduce my screen-time on PCs, mobile, TVs and other digital devices. Thanks to the True Tone display on iPad Pro, I had a pleasant time reading books and at no point did my eyes feel any discomfort. At first glance, bezels are visibly thick around the edges, but it is still slim for a tablet of this magnitude. Actually, it is helpful for the fingers to hold the iPad without extending it to the functional screen while watching multimedia content. Also, the high screen-to-body ratio, uniformity and curves around corners make the new Apple tablet more visually appealing than ever before as far as the iPads of yore are concerned. On the back, it has a premium metallic-shell with a 12MP primary camera and an LED flash along with two antenna lines, one on the top and another at the bottom. Also, I love the Face ID, which scans the owner's face to unlock the screen. Have to say, unlike iPhones, fewer people will miss the fingerprint scanner on the new iPad Pro. Face ID of the iPad is an improvement over Apple mobiles. The former can recognise the face from any angle, they intend to use it at unlike the iPhone X and later mobiles, where the owner has to hold them with upright with the front camera on top to recognise the face. Apple should bring this particular iPad Pro feature to the iPhones as well. I Have to mention the magnets on iPad Pro. The company has used 102 tiny magnets and they are the most powerful I have seen on a tablet or any device so far. It is so powerful it can cling on to the refrigerator. However, I advise readers not to attempt it because small distraction on your part, may cause the iPad to drop, and believe me, it will leave a very deep cut in your pocket for repairs and service. Speaking of magnets, Apple iPad Pro comes with four speakers two each on top and at the bottom and they are the loudest I have seen in a tablet if not a laptop! Yet, the audio is clear and concise with a stereo surround effect which makes for a pleasant experience watching videos. It also has four mics and would definitely help during FaceTime video calls. Even if you close one or two mics on the sides while holding the big-screen up, the other two will still be able to pick up voice. The Type C USB port in the iPad Pro deserves special mention. For years consumers and tech critics alike have been longing for a universal port for Apple devices and the company has finally delivered it. This decision bodes well for Apple, which prides itself as an eco-friendly company. By having its own proprietary lightning port, it created an unnecessary demand for niche accessories, leading to the plundering of natural resources for raw materials. Now by using the ubiquitous Type-C port, consumers will not only get the freedom to select their brand of choice, but there will also be fewer wires and connector dongles to worry about. Most importantly, consumers and even Apple will be able to reduce their carbon footprint even further. Hopefully, Apple incorporates similar port in next-generation iPhones coming in 2019. There are apprehensions surrounding the structural stability of the 5.9mm thick iPad Pro and believe me, it is well built and sturdy to sustain normal day-to-day wear and tear. Also unlike phones, there is very less chance of a big-screen tablet slipping out of hands unless you are literally sweating butter out your hands. There are lots of test videos on YouTube, which are plain crazy and do not represent real-life scenarios. Performance I had a flawless and lag-free experience on the A12 Bionic-powered iPhone XS, XS Max and XR series and now, with the updated A12X Bionic on the iPad Pro (2018), there is a marked difference for the better. Here, I had a delightful experience gaming and doodling with the Apple Pencil 2 on Notes and other drawing apps. For the uninitiated, Apple's new A12X Bionic comes with an 8-core CPU with four dedicated efficiency cores and four high-performance cores. It is integrated with the proprietary 7-core GPU and additional 8-core Neural-engine. Together they make the new iPad Pro the most powerful tablet on the planet. It can even give modern laptops a run for their money and has the capacity to kill that whole segment, which is already witnessing dwindling in sales. Benchmark scores are already in the public domain. They are on par and in some cases better than high-end laptops. On AnTuTu, my Apple iPad Pro (2018) review unit scored a mind-boggling 5, 55,478 points. It can play graphics-intensive games including Augmented Reality (AR) apps and also help users go through video editing without breaking a sweat. Adobe is preparing a full-fledged Photoshop CC application for the iPad Pro and is slated to hit the App Store early in 2019 and going by the demo during launch, I am confident the new Apple tablet will be buttery smooth, maybe even better than some laptops. I have to confess though I am a newbie at this, just started learning video editing. I am a bit late to the party but hey, it's better late than never right! With some help and tips from friends, I spent a few minutes using the iMovie and Quik video editing apps on the iPad Pro (2018) and it showed no lag. Most importantly, I had a lot of fun learning the nuances of multimedia editing and also got a feel of the raw power of the new Apple tablet. Overall, I had a great experience working on the iPad Pro and intend to dig deeper and explore every possible feature, probably return with a long-term review in the coming months. Camera The new iPad Pro comes with a feature-rich 12MP (F1.8 aperture) snapper, a big upgrade over its predecessor. It also boasts of a Smart HDR mode for photos like iPhone XS and XR series, Live Photos with stabilisation, Quad-LED True Tone Flash, Wide colour capture for photos and Live photos, Backside illumination, Five-element lens, Hybrid IR filter, Autofocus with Focus Pixels, Tap to focus with Focus Pixels, Exposure control, Panorama (up to 63 megapixels), Burst mode, Timer mode and Photo geo-tagging. Yes, it has all the bells and whistles that can be seen in the latest iPhones, but I personally didn't feel the urge to go on a photography excursion with the large-screen iPad Pro. It is best suited to take images of documents and with feature-rich apps on the App Store, can convert them to PDF and in a way, it is a productive exercise. Up front, it houses a TrueDepth 7MP camera with Animoji and Memoji, Live photos, Retina Flash, 1080p HD video recording, Smart HDR for photos and videos, Backside illumination, and Burst mode. It even boasts of Portrait lighting with all five modes—Natural light, Studio light, Contour light, Stage light and Stage light mono including Depth control feature seen in the new 2018-series iPhones. This is Apple just showing off its hardware capabilities on a tablet, and I have to say, people are unlikely to take portraits or even normal selfies for that matter on this iPad Pro, as the device is too big to hold and iPhones are best suited for clicking pictures. However, people can experiment with the Memoji feature on FaceTime and it will sure be fun Battery life In spite of the enormous screen, Apple iPad Pro (2018), offers decent battery life. I used it to watch TV shows on streaming platforms, but only for about one hour a day. Rest of the time, I browsed the web and read books. Just to test its capabilities, I also played Asphalt 9, it was fun playing on a large screen. Also, I tried the AR-based Night Sky app and the 3D imagery looks awesome on the wide display. I noticed the battery drained faster while doodling on Notes and also on other sketch-based apps compared to other applications. It's not like I spent the whole day using the iPad Pro. I just used it in short breaks in between work and while commuting between office and home. Overall, the new iPad Pro lived up to my expectations. Also, I like the reverse charging capability of the Apple tablet. It lets iPhones draw power when connected to the new iPad Pro. This is a welcome value-addition feature. Apple Pencil (2nd gen) The new generation Apple Pencil is a much better piece of tech over its predecessor. Apple has done a pretty good job refining its design, particularly ditching that awkward port connector from the back. It has a unibody form factor with no removable cap and it gets a big thumbs-up. The first generation model looked odd with a lightning connector at the bottom and when connected to the iPad for charging, there was a risk of breakage. Also, the matte finish and one flat side on the Pencil makes writing or drawing on the screen feel natural. Again, the flat side helps to easily stick it to the iPad for wireless charging. The sensitivity of the Pencil's tip has also undergone a marked improvement. I had a great time doodling on Note apps trying brush strokes. I loved the smart tap sensor placed appropriately just a few inches above the tip. The ergonomic design makes it so much easy to switch between drawing and erasing. By the way, you can switch between multiple options for the double tap feature. For instance, you switch the eraser option to colour palette so that you can quickly change the colours of the pen or the brush.   Apple Smart Keyboard Folio The iPad Pro's keyboard also doubles up as a sturdy outer cover with a matte finish, but it does attract a lot of dust and sweaty fingerprint smudges. Thankfully, it can be wiped clean with hands or a cloth. I also like the fact that it does not depend on Bluetooth to establish a connection with the iPad Pro, it instead comes with a three-pin magnetic connector. It is intuitive enough to know when to activate and not to. It becomes functional only when the iPad is pulled to either one of the grooves above the keypad in the laptop position. If you fully flip it to the back side in tablet mode, the keys won't get triggered even when it gets pressed by any type of hard surface or even fingers. on tablet mode, only the onscreen keyboard will pop up. Except for the lack of a track-pad, it gives the Apple iPad Pro a laptop experience.  Final thoughts: Yes, Apple iPad Pro is powerful and will help you do almost everything. There are lots of advantages that the iPad Pro has over conventional carry-on PCs; it is lightweight, has a versatile Pencil, USB Type C port, long battery life and much more. But... Apple's iOS pulls the iPad Pro from reaching its full potential. One particular qualm I have with the iPad Pro is that though it can connect to a camera or to an external monitor gives you a PC-like experience, there are limitations. We cannot freely exchange files between Apple iPad Pro and a portable storage unit. Even the Apple's Folio keyboard though feature-rich is tightly wound and lacks space for a usable track-pad. this is where you start to miss a full-sized laptop. It also may not be the go-to device for professional graphic designers or software developers, but for a Journalist like me, the Apple iPad Pro offers everything I need. I can edit short videos (which I plan to master soon), write articles, browse the internet for the latest news, social media platforms, shop online, read e-books and watch hours of multimedia content.  It may take days if not weeks, but eventually, you will get used to the iPad Pro. People in other professions and college-going grad students out there who do similar things on personal PCs can make the switch without any apprehension. If you are concerned about the price of the new iPad Pro, then you can try the affordable iPad (6th gen), which, will support the first-gen Apple Pencil. This is also a very good gift option for kids. It will be beneficial for parents who want to inculcate reading habits at a very early age in their children's life.

Recently, Amazon launched the all-new Paperwhite (4 Gen), tenth Kindle version in 11 years. The company claims to have added new features and also the new Kindle Paperwhite is said to be more durable compared to any previous iterations. I have been using the device for close to a week and here's what I think about it. Design, display and build quality: The all-new Kindle Paperwhite's design language is simplistic. It has smooth sides and curvaceous corners. It has just two physical touch points at the base, one power button --on/off and the micro USB port for charging. Rest of the three sides are clean adding value to the visual appeal. On the back, it has 'Amazon' engraving on top in the middle and standard model details at the bottom. The whole shell comes in black-shade with matte finish offering good grip for the fingers to hold on to it. For the first time, Kindle Paperwhite series also comes with IPX8 waterproof certification, meaning it can sustain not just accidental water splash or rain showers, but also survive underwater submerged for close to 60 minutes up to 5 feet (around 1.5 meters). For the sake of testing, I kept the new Kindle Paperwhite under tap water and washed it off with a dry cloth. I then tried using launching the device by pressing device's wake button, it worked. I also tested the on-screen buttons on the display panel and to my surprise, it worked flawlessly. Another big improvement is the display panel. It sports a 6-inch display with 300 ppi (pixels per inch), which promises crisp and laser-quality text on the screen. It boasts E Ink Carta technology, built-in light (five LEDs), optimized font technology, 16-level grey scale and an adjustable front light for a uniform, glare-free display in any setting – be in low-light conditions or with direct sunlight from above. User-experience: Amazon Kindle Paperwhite (4 gen) has simple and minimalistic user-interface; even a first-time consumer can set it up and start using it no time. I hardly took 10 minutes to launch it, connect it to Wi-Fi and open my Amazon account. If you happen to have purchased several e-books and downloaded to older Kindle series e-reader, all will get automatically synced to the new model seamlessly. It is much easier than transferring app-data from one phone to another. With just a tap on top of the screen, home button, settings will appear and there you can adjust brightness, font size and even dark reading mode, which makes the background go black and the words light up, which is best for people to read e-books in the night but can't use the bed lamp so that the partner beside you, need not get disturbed. It also offers options to adjust font size, font face, line spacing and margins. While setting up the Kindle for the first time, it asks what kind of genres of books we prefer. It lists a series of book titles and we have to select them and this apparently helps the device on what to suggest. It doesn't stop there, as the device continues to learn our reading habits and begin suggesting the titles worth reading. Another interesting aspect of the new Kindle Paperwhite is the VoiceView screen reader. It can be activated with a Bluetooth-based wireless headset. It provides spoken feedback, which allows us to navigate the device and read books with text-to-speech, but it is currently available in English only. Since it is just used for reading, Kindle Paperwhite can last for several days if not weeks with just a single charge. I opened the review unit last week with 80% and yet, it still has more than 35% battery life. Final thoughts: Overall, the new Kindle Paperwhite (4 gen) is a perfect companion for book enthusiasts as it can accommodate truck loads of reading content.  If they are hard-cover, it can easily fill up a library, but with Kindle Paperwhite, you can carry it in your back pocket. It works in all lighting conditions and did not hurt my eyes during the entire review period. Also, you can take it out even near the swimming pool or any water body for that matter and read fearlessly without worrying the device might get wet. You can just wipe the liquid and continue reading. The top-end model comes with 4G support, meaning it can truly be a mobile device, which doesn't have to depend on companion phone for Wi-Fi hotspot to access or purchase e-books on the go. Amazon Kindle Paperwhite (4 gen) comes in two models—8GB (with Wi-Fi only) and 32GB (with Wi-Fi & 4G)—for Rs 12,999 and Rs 17,999, respectively. The former is already available for purchase on Amazon India, while the latter is slated to go on sale on December 5. Consumers who pre-order it now are entitled to get three months of Kindle Unlimited for free. They get unlimited access to over 1 million titles including— The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People,  Strength Training, Quidditch Through the Ages, Ikshvaku Ke Vanshaj and more. ","

325,2018-11-06,16:12:17,technology,tablets,Diwali gift guide: Here's best of Apple to gift to your family this festive season," Diwali, the three-day festival of light, is just underway in India. And people believe it is an auspicious time to buy new things, be it clothes, home appliances or jewellery. Now, smart gadgets such as phones, laptops, fitness bands and tablets are also being considered as good gifts for family members. In the last couple of months, Apple has been busy announcing new products such as iPhone XS, XR series, Watch Series 4, iPads, MacBook PCs and more. Most of them have made their way to the Indian market. All are premium and powerful that makeup as a thoughtful gift to your loved ones this Diwali festive season. Apple Watch Series 4: This can be the most meaningful gift that tells you how much concern you have for parents. Apple Watch Series 4 is the most advanced smart wearable in the country. It comes huge upgrade over the predecessor including a new accelerometer and gyroscope, which are able to detect hard falls, and an electrical heart rate sensor that can take an electrocardiogram (ECG)using the new ECG app, which has been granted a De Novo classification by the FDA. Apple plans to get similar regulatory approvals in other regions from respective government agencies. Yes, even the India-bound Watch series 4 has the same hardware seen in the Apple's smart wearable in America and once the company gets the local health agency's nod it will be activated with a minor software update. With watchOS 5 onboard, the Watch Series 4 brings advanced activities, communications features and state-of-the-art health capabilities including new Yoga fitness tracker in the Workout app. It is powered by the next-generation Apple S4 dual-core chip, delivering twice the speed while maintaining the same all-day battery life. It also boasts new generations W3 wireless chip for stronger Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity with companion accessories. It flaunts visually appealing curvy lozenge-like structure with the sleek body (just 10.7 mm thickness) and comes with more than 35-per cent increased display compared to the predecessor. The Watch Series 4 looks stunning with near edge-to-edge screen and thanks to the new interface watchOS 5, it offers more information with richer detail. Apple Watch Series 4 comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm with prices starting at Rs 49,900. Consumers can check out the Apple Watch Series 3 (review), as it is now more affordable than before. It also comes premium build quality, feature-rich health and fitness tracking capability including advanced heart rate scanner, activity rings (move, stand and exercise), in addition to the LTE connectivity support and a full day's battery life. Apple iPhone XS, XS Max or iPhone XR: Apple's latest iPhone XS(review),  the iPhone XS Max and the iPhone XR come with proprietary A2 Bionic and is the most advanced and powerful mobile chipset for a mobile in the market. The benchmark scores are way ahead of all rival Android phones and even with a software update, they will never come close with their current hardware specs. I have used all the three Apple mobiles and mighty impressed with all the aspects. I never faced any lagging issue whatsoever be it while playing graphics-intense games, Augmented Reality(AR) apps or and any power-intensive apps. Even the camera features such as the adjustable depth control, Slo-mo video recording and stereo video recording and playback are magical. Now, with the release of iOS 12.1, users can make real-time depth control while taking the portrait mode photos, the smooth blur effect transformation of the background and the subject in the front is mesmerising. Also, e-SIM for Dual-SIM functionality is also now live for Reliance Jio and Airtel in India. Consumers can just to respective retail store and fill some formal application and within few hours it will be activated. In terms of build quality, Apple has done a remarkable job. It has used ultra-premium surgical grade steel frame around the edges for the iPhone XS and the XS Max and for the XR, it has incorporated impressive aerospace aluminium material. All the models come with superior quality glass on top of the display and on the back offering stunning look to the mobiles. All the three Apple mobile models—the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max (review) and the iPhone XR—are available with up to Rs 10,000 discount on several authorised brick-and-mortar retail shops. E-commerce firms are offering more cash back, in addition to lucrative exchange deals. Apple iPad (6th Gen): The new iPad Pro (2018) are expected come later in the year, but generic iPad (6th Gen), which was announced earlier in the year are premium and feature-rich too and they far better compared to any other Android tablets in the market. The iPad (6th Gen), is Apple's first-ever non-Pro tablet series to support Pencil stylus. It gives users the ability to be even more productive, from sketching ideas and jotting down handwritten notes to marking up screenshots. The new iPad sports an eye-friendly large 9.7-inch Retina display, a powerful A10 Fusion chip and advanced sensors that help deliver immersive augmented reality, and provides unmatched portability, ease of use and all-day battery life. Most importantly, the new iOS 12 offers Screen Time feature which allows parents set time for children to use the iPad and beyond which, they have to get permission from elders for extended sessions. Also, Apple's iOS is the most secured mobile operating system, so there are fewer chances of the device getting infected with malware or virus and also there are several parental control apps on Apple Store, which parents can install so that they can block access to age-inappropriate sites from the purview of the children. Price starts Rs 28,999. It can be noted that Flipkart, Amazon and other Apple authorised sellers are offering lucrative festive cash back and exchange deals. Apple AirPods: Apple AirPods series very unique compared to rival brands. It comes with the company's proprietary W1 chip, which is designed to receive the signal independently to both the earpieces. On the other hand, wireless earphones offered by competitors, only one among the two ear pods receive the direct signal from the media player, while the second one receives the audio from the primary earpiece. Apple AirPods boasts optical sensors and accelerometers that work with the Apple's in-house built W1 chip to detect when earphones are in your ear, so they only play when you are ready to listen. If the user removes the AirPods, iPhone automatically pauses the music. Users can also access Siri by double tapping the AirPods to select and control the music, change the volume, check your battery life or perform any other Siri task. With an additional accelerometer in each AirPod, it intuitively knows if the user is speaking, enabling a pair of beam-forming microphones to focus on the sound of your voice, filtering out external noise to make your voice clearer. Another noteworthy attribute of the AirPods is its ultra-low power consumption. Apple W1 chip operates at one-third of the power of traditional wireless chips, enabling the AirPods to deliver up to 5 hours of listening time on one full charge. The custom-designed charging case holds additional charge of more than 24 hours of total listening time, ensuring AirPods are charged and ready to go anytime. It costs Rs 12,900. Apple TV 4K: It is powered by Apple A10X Fusion chipset. And as the name suggests, it supports 4K content support and that too in HDR (High Dynamic Range) 10 Dolby Vision, which promises the highest standard of image/video quality on a television. It also can automatically optimize the television's setup for the best quality picture and the 4K TV owners can pick and choose 60 services and also be able to invoke Siri via voice command to find your favourite TV shows or movies or live sporting event. Furthermore, Apple TV owners can also get live sporting updates or set reminders to catch the game on their Apple Watch.

And also, Apple TV will soon be able to act as a smart home hub, which will allow owners to control ACs, lights and more (HomeKit accessories) in the smart connected house. It is available for Rs 17,430 ( 32GB) in India. MacBook Air (2018): The new MacBook Air sports a 13.3-inch (diagonal) LED-backlit Retina display with 2560x1600p resolutions and 300 nits brightness. It has a smaller footprint, as it takes up 17% less volume, is 1a 0% thinner measuring just .61 inches at its thickest point, and at just 2.75 pounds (1.24Kg) is a quarter pound lighter than the previous generation. Under-the-hood, it houses eighth generation Intel dual-core Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost up to 3.6GHz CPU speed, Intel UHD Graphics 617, 8GB RAM, 128GB/256GB, macOS Mojave and 50.3 watt-hours lithium-polymer battery with support for 30W USB-C power adapter. Apple claims that the new PC will offer battery life up to 12 hours wireless web browsing and close to 13 hours iTunes movie playback. It also supports two Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports, 802.11 ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2 wireless technology, FaceTime HD camera, full-sized backlit keyboard with Force Touch trackpad. The interesting aspect of the new Apple MacBook Air is eco-friendly. Its body is made of custom, Apple-designed aluminium alloy that enables the use of 100 percent recycled aluminium for the first time, which has the same strength, durability and beautiful finish as the aluminium in all Apple products. Using this custom aluminium alloy helps reduce MacBook Air's carbon footprint by nearly 50 percent, making it the greenest Mac ever, Apple claims. Mac Mini: Apple's new Mac Mini comes with a visually appealing compact body in Space Grey shade. Though the design and dimensions are same as the predecessor, it is said to be five times faster performance, making it the most powerful Mac mini ever made. It comes in two options—quad-core and six-core— 8th-generation Intel Core processors with Turbo Boost Speeds up to 4.6GHz and Intel UHD Graphics 630 GPU, 8GB RAM (2666MHz DDR4 SO-DIMM), 128GB/256GB (PCIe-based SSD). The company claims that the Mac Mini will do hard tasks on Desktops such as photo and video editing, music creation and software development, and crushes pro workflows including video transcoding, code compiling and live musical performances. And with up to 64GB of 2666 MHz memory, Mac mini can load larger files into memory, run more virtual machines or manipulate even larger data sets. Every Mac mini now features the speed and reliability of all-flash storage. With capacities up to 2TB, the SSDs on Mac mini are up to four times faster, so working with large files and opening apps is quicker than ever. And with Thunderbolt 3 USB C ports (x4), HDMI 2.0 (x1), USB 3 (x2), 3.5mm audio jack, the Apple T2 Security Chip and a 10Gb Ethernet option, the new Mac mini is a faster and more capable desktop that can do so much more. For those unaware, The Apple T2 Security Chip is an industry-leading security technology. The T2 features an SSD controller with on-the-fly data encryption so everything stored on the SSD is automatically and fully encrypted. The Secure Enclave in T2 ensures that software loaded during the boot process has not been tampered with. T2 also features HEVC video transcoding that's up to an incredible 30 times faster, enabling pro users to work more quickly with higher resolution video throughout their workflow. Like the new MacBook Air, Mac mini too is eco-friendly device. It's enclosure uses Apple-designed aluminium alloy made from 100 percent recycled aluminium,which has the same strength, durability and beautiful finish as the aluminium in all Apple products. The Mac mini also features the use of more post-consumer recycled plastic in parts like the foot. All together these advancements help to reduce the carbon footprint of the new Mac mini by nearly 50 percent. Apple MacBook Air and Mac mini price and availability: The new MacBook Air (gold, space grey and silver) and Mac mini (space grey) will be available for order through Apple Authorised Resellers starting Wednesday, November 7 with prices starting at Rs 1,14,900 and Rs 75,900, respectively.","

326,2018-10-31,11:42:29,technology,tablets,Apple unveils powerful iPad Pro (2018) with A12X Bionic CPU: Everything you need to know," World's most valuable technology company Apple unveiled the new line of iPad Pro with visually appealing new design and truck load of new features in Brooklyn on 30 October. Apple's new iPad Pro borrows the edge-to-edge LCD display from the popular iPhone XR. The interesting thing about the new Apple tablet, it has a slim bezel and has no notch thus guaranteeing rich cinematic viewing on the large screen. It comes with two sizes--11.0-inch and 12.9-inch and it can be noted that the former has same dimensions as 10.5-inch model seen in the predecessor, but thanks to FullView design, the top and the base bezel have been trimmed. Surprisingly, the 12.9-inch has shrunk in physical structure compared to the predecessor, but again thanks to Apple's ingenious design technique, the display real estate is same as the latter. Apple's new iPad Pro is the company's slimmest tablet to date; it comes with just 5.9mm thickness and yet it promises to offer long-lasting battery life, close to 10 hours of video playback. It also packs four speakers. Another big change we see in the new iPad Pro is the Type-C USB port a first for Apple tablet. It offers reverse charging capability in addition to fast charging. Inside, it also comes with 102 tiny magnets which offer accessories to attach to the iPad Pro seamlessly and speaking of accessory, Apple also introduced Pencil (2nd gen) and it comes with wireless charging capability, unlike the predecessor which comes with the weird lightning jack to connect to iPad. Now, the new Pencil can just attach to the iPad and get charged when in idle. Also, it supports smart double touch feature, where the user can switch between modes—write or erase or customise to others actions, as well. Also, Apple has introduced Face ID, which can scan the owner's face from any angle, he/she intends to use, unlike iPhone X and later mobiles, where you have to hold them with the upright with front-camera on top to recognise the face. Under-the-hood, it comes with the powerful 7nm class 8-core A12X Bionic chipset, which is said to be more powerful compared to A12 Bionic seen in iPhone XS and XR series. The former comes with 64-bit class desktop architecture and comes integrated with 7-core GPU, M12 coprocessor and dedicated Neural Engine, which can perform more than 5 trillion operations per second. As far as the photography hardware is concerned, it comes with a 12MP primary camera with F1.8 aperture and a 7MP FaceTime front camera. Going by the features, Apple's new iPad Pro (2018) is undoubtedly the most versatile tablet, which will soon hit the stores worldwide in coming weeks. The new Apple iPad Pro series, depending on the size and connectivity options (Wi-Fi only or Wi-Fi+LTE), the price ranges between Rs 71,900 to Rs 1,71,900 in India (full price list below). As of now, there is no word on when Apple iPad Pro series will be available in India, but it is expected to come before the end of November or early December. Apple's second-generation Apple Pencil for the new iPad Pro will be available for RS 10,900. The new Smart Keyboard Folio for the new iPad Pro is available in space grey for Rs 15,900 for the 11-inch iPad Pro and Rs 17,900 for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro with layouts for over 30 languages, including simplified Chinese, French, German, Japanese and Spanish. A new Smart Folio for iPad Pro, in a protective, polyurethane folio design, will be available in a variety of colours for Rs 7,500 for the 11-inch iPad Pro and Rs 9,900 for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro.

328,2018-10-29,14:46:00,technology,tablets,Apple Special Event October 2018: What to expect at the big hardware showcase programme," Apple had hosted Education event at Chicago to unveil new iPad in March and followed up with the World Wide Developer Conference (WWDC) 2018 in June to show developments made in software (iOS and macOS) and the fall event in September to reveal the new line of iPhone XS and XR mobile series; just when everybody thought the Cupertino-based company is done for the year, it has surprised everyone by announcing that it is hosting another hardware unveiling programme on 30 October. With just a day before the event, many reports are coming in that Apple has a whole lot of products to showcase at the Special Event October 2018 in Brooklyn, which is slated to go live at 10:00 am EDT (7:30 pm IST) in Brooklyn on Tuesday. The invitation to the media features artistic and colourful Apple logo with a message—""There's more in the making""— and going by the unique presentation, many are of the opinion that the company will unveil the new line of the iPad Pro and also possibly Macbook series too. Recently leaked iOS 12.1 beta, Apple has included a new bezel-less iPad icon hinting that the upcoming Pro tablet series will indeed embrace the edge-to-edge display feature of the iPhone X series and also boast Face ID security feature. The good news is that the iPad Pro (2018) will not have the notch. This also means there won't any fingerprint sensor at the base, as well and 2018 will mark the end of the revolutionary Touch ID, which made its debut with iPhone 5S will no longer feature in any of Apple products. It is said to come in two sizes having dimensions almost same as the current—10.5-inch and 12.9-inch— but will have more screen real estate due to thinning of bezels and will have advanced true tone display technology. Another big change coming in the new iPad Pro is the inclusion of Type C USB port instead of lightning cable seen in the current iPad and iPhone series. As far as internal hardware is concerned, the new iPad Pro (2018) series is expected to come with a modified version Apple A12 processor seen in the iPhone XS, XS Max and XR series. The previous generation iPad Pro comes with Apple A10X Fusion with M10 co-processor. Its successor is likely to come with either A11X series to continue the chronological order or maybe jump to A12X Bionic Fusion series to make it on parity with iPhone processor naming scheme. It is expected to perform on par with a PC computer. Apple is also likely to bring the new generation Pencil stylus with improved sensitivity and also offer longer battery life. Apple, earlier in the year, unveiled new heavy duty MacBook Pro series with upgraded Intel processors and now many believe the company will finally bring new MacBook Air, which was last refreshed in 2015. Word on the street is that Apple is likely to bring next-generation Mac Mini with latest Intel chips for normal home and office purposes. For those unaware, the previous generation was unveiled way back in 2014. Other important announcements expected at Apple Special Event October 2018 include iOS 12.1. It is either expected to reveal the software release timeline or else just begin rolling out to the eligible iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch (6th gen). Also, the company is also touted finally reveal the actual availability date of the AirPower wireless charging pad. It was announced during the iPhone X launch event in September 2017 and was expected to hit stores in early 2018, but so far Apple has been mum on it. The company might finally make it available to the consumers during the upcoming festive shopping season.","

329,2018-10-19,16:46:22,technology,tablets,"Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 with S Pen, Dex support launched in India: Quick facts"," World's leading smartphone-maker Samsung has launched the flagship tablet Galaxy Tab S4 series in India. Samsung's new Galaxy Tab S4 comes with premium build quality. It sports a massive 10.5-inch super AMOLED screen with 2560x1600p resolution, which guarantees a delightful viewing experience. Under-the-hood, it comes packed with Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 octa-core processor with 4GB RAM, 64GB/256GB storage, which can be expandable up to 400GB via microSD. This feature will allow users to store a large number of media contents be it the still images or movies. It also comes with a massive 7,300mAh cell, which ensures long battery life even when streaming videos on multimedia content services such as Amazon Prime Video or Infinix. To further enhance the user experience, Samsung has incorporated four speakers tuned by AKG and Dolby Atmos immersive sound technology. With such top-end hardware, consumers will be able to hear crisper dialogue, enveloping sound fields, maximized loudness without distortion, and consistent playback volume in the Galaxy Tab S4. The Galaxy Tab S4 also comes with two cameras—one, 13MP primary shooter with LED flash on the rear-side and another 5MP snapper, which also comes with companion sensors on the front to assist in identifying real device owner with Iris scanner feature. Like the Galaxy Note9, the new Galaxy Tab S4 also comes with S Pen stylus in the retail package. The company claims the redesigned S Pen offers an authentic handwriting experience—it's perfect for drawing, taking notes, and other different forms of communication. It also offers users a great way to express their creativity and communicate. They can take notes on the fly through the Screen-Off Memo feature, as well as navigate, translate and organize notes through Samsung Notes, and even send personalized texts through Samsung Live Message – all with the S Pen.

330,2018-10-19,14:40:29,technology,tablets,"Apple Special Event 2018: New iPad Pro, MacBook and more coming this October-end"," Apple, the world's most valuable technology company, announced to host the new product unveiling event later this month. Apple Special Event is scheduled at 10:00 am EDT (7:30 pm IST) in Brooklyn on October 30. It has sent out several unique invites with artistic and colourful Apple logo with a message—""There's more in the making""— to the media outlets. The company's official page has vibrant purple and orange painted Apple insignia with bubbles and everytime the page is refreshed, it changes to a new design, giving away the hint that it has a new iPad series. It can be noted that Cupertino-based company already unveiled the generic iPad (6th Gen), earlier this year. So, the upcoming device is most likely to the iPad Pro (2018) with improved Apple Pencil stylus. The new iPad Pro most probably will keep the 10.5-inch and 12.9-inch screen sizes as the predecessor, but everything else will undergo changes. Design wise, leaked reports have indicated the company will finally bring the iPhone X's Face ID feature and this means, iPad Pro 2018 series might come with a notch on top but will have an edge-to-edge screen, which will definitely bring more value addition in terms of security and also enhance the cinematic viewing experience. Thanks to A12 Bionic, Apple iPhone XS and the XS Max including the iPhone XR series are powerful phones, which rival Android brands will take a year to match them. We believe Apple iPad Pro (2018) might also come with a similar processor if not better capable of performing on par with a PC computer. The previous generation iPad Pro comes with Apple A10X Fusion with M10 co-processor. Its successor is likely to come with either A11X series to continue the chronological order or maybe jump to A12X Bionic Fusion series to make it on parity with iPhone processor naming scheme. Apple is also likely to bring the new Pencil stylus with improved sensitivity and also offer longer battery life. Besides new iPad Pro series, Apple is expected to announce AirPod 2 with longer wireless earphone connectivity range and increased battery life. Also, there is a possibility of the new MacBook Air with 9th gen Intel processors breaking covers. In a related development, Apple's new Watch Series 4 finally made their way to Indian stores on October 19.","

331,2018-10-10,12:30:55,technology,tablets,"Made by Google launch event highlights: Pixel 3, Home Hub, Pixel Slate and more"," After weeks of leaks and rumours, search engine giant Google has finally unveiled the new generation Pixel phones and a couple of interesting new product categories to take on rival Apple iPad and Amazon's Echo Show. Like the previous versions, the new Pixel 3 comes in two models — Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL. Except for the size, front screen design and battery capacity, the rest of the attributes remain the same for both the devices. Pixel 3 sports a smaller 5.5-inch full HD+ OLED screen and come with 2,915 cell. On the other hand, the Pixel 3 XL flaunts a bigger 6.3-inch Quad HD+ display with a notch on top and a 3,430mAh battery. Both the Pixel phones come with dual-tone glass cover on the back. Most parts of the devices' back panel have textured finish and at the top, they have smooth glass and a single lens camera. Google has used Corning Gorilla Glass 5 shield on both front and the back panel with a sturdy aluminium frame around the edges. They also come with IP68 ratings, meaning the devices can survive submerged for close to 2 meters underwater for up to 30 minutes. Under-the-hood, the Pixel 3 series comes with 4GB RAM, 64GB/128GB storage, Android Pie and Snapdragon 845 octa-core, Qualcomm's most powerful processor to date. The highlight of the Pixel 3 series is the photography hardware. On the front, they feature two 8MP shooters, one with F1.8 aperture and another with F2.2 aperture. On the back, they house 12.2MP (with F1.8 aperture) single lens snapper backed by Google state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered camera software. Some interesting modes include-- Top Shot, which uses AI to help the user capture the perfect photo every time. When you take a motion photo, it captures alternate shots in HDR+, then recommends the best one—even if it's not exactly when you hit the shutter, looking for those where everyone is smiling, with eyes open, and facing the camera. Another notable feature is the Super-Res Zoom, which uses a computational photography technique, traditionally used for astronomy and scientific imaging, that produces sharp details when you zoom. Night Sight mode, which will soon be coming to the Pixel 3 series via software update, will enable users to take bright, detailed, colourful shots in a low-light environment such as the campfire, in a moonlit forest, or a selfie at the dimly-lit club. Google promises that Pixel 3 series' front dual-camera with Group Selfie mode, will give 184% wide-angle coverage more than normal selfies. The new Pixel phones also come with Photobooth mode that uses AI to recognize that when they're smiling or making a funny expression, and ready for a selfie. It snaps the photo on its own so that you don't need to reach for the shutter button—a good option for candids. Google has also incorporated improved Portrait Mode, which allows changing the blurriness of the background or changes the part of the picture in focus, after taking the photo. Google Photos can also make the subject of the photo pop by leaving them in colour while changing the background to black and white. The new Pixel 3 series prices start at Rs 71,000 (full details below) in India. It can be pre-booked starting Thursday from Flipkart and other popular online stores and also brick-and-mortar retail chains such as Reliance Digital, Tata-owned Croma store, among others. The devices will be available for off-the-shelves purchase from 1 November. Besides the new phones, Google also announced the new Pixel Slate. It sports a 12.3-inch Molecular Display with 3000x2000p resolution with support Pixelbook Pen stylus and is powered by Chrome OS with 48Wh battery. It also features an 8MP camera on the back and another 8MP shooter on the front.  It comes in multiple configurations with Intel Celeron Processor / 8th Gen Intel Core m3 / Core i5 / Core i7 CPU in 4GB RAM + 32GB SSD/ 8GB RAM + 64GB/128GB SSD/ 6GB RAM+256GB SSD storages and the prices start at $599. Google is offering companion accessories-- Pixel Slate Keyboard is $199, and Pixelbook Pen is $99. All three will be available later this year on Google Store, and at major retailers in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. Mountain View-headquartered company also unveiled the new Google Home Hub. It is basically a smart speaker with a 7.0-inch HD display and two sensitive microphones for Google Assistant to listen and perform actions. It is powered by Android Things OS and the company specifically avoided camera in the device to offer privacy. Considering the personal privacy security scare in recent times, it's a well-thought move by Google. Home Hub is price $149, and starting today, consumers can pre-order from the Google Store. It will hit store shelves on 22 October at Best Buy, Target, Walmart, and other retailers in the US. The company also announced new third-generation Chrome Cast. It flaunts a visually appealing pebble stone design. The company says it comes with a 15 per cent improvement in hardware speed, and supports smooth streaming in 1080p at 60 frames per second, giving a more lifelike image on the TV screen. Also, later in the Google will be releasing a software update that will enable Chromecast to connect to smart speaker groups, so the consumer can listen to their music in sync throughout the house. It costs $35, the same as the predecessor. It is available on the Google Store starting today in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Great Britain, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Sweden, and the U.S., with even more countries to follow in 2019, the company said.","

334,2018-07-31,07:09:00,technology,tablets,"Apple iPad Pro (2018) to get iPhone X-features like Face ID, Animoji and more"," Apple had launched an affordable iPad with Pencil (stylus) compatibility -- a first for generic tablet series -- earlier this year. Now, the tech giant is tipped to bring the top-end iPad Pro (2018) for the upcoming fall event in September and rumour has it that the device will be borrowing a lot of features from the iPhone X. As you would have guessed it by now, the new iPad Pro will be embracing the Face ID and ditch fingerprint sensor.  Like the previous editions, iPad Pro (2018) will be coming in two screen sizes -- 10.5-inch and 12.9-inch. The former comes with 247.5 mm high, 174.1 mm wide and 6.1 mm thickness while the latter is said to come in dimensions of 280 mm high, 215 mm wide and 6.4 mm thickness, Macotakara reported citing the Apple supplier-company insider. It can be noted that the dimensions are smaller as compared to 2017-series, however, thanks to the space left vacant by the fingerprint sensor, Apple has extended functional display up to the edges. The new iPad Pros will be compact and yet offer the same delightful viewing experience with its True Tone display technology. However, there is no word if the device will have an iPhone X-like notch or not. Rest assured, the device will have FullView screen with the high screen-to-body ratio. With the advanced camera for FaceID, iPad Pro will also be supporting Animoji. The iMessaging will be more fun than before, as the iOS 12 will be bringing features to make animations even more expressive including tongue movements. The option can also create a personalised caricature of the user with a multitude of tools to adjust skin tone, hair colour, curly, smooth hair types and other functionalities. The Japanese tech blog also noted that the smart connector, which is usually found on the side to dock to the keyboard and help the user work on the iPad Pro in landscape mode, will be moved to the bottom, near the lightning port. This would mean that the keyboard would have to be docked vertically to the iPad Pro and does not make any sense whatsoever. However, the source has said that the smart keyboard accessories will be designed to adjust to the new design and yet offer horizontal positioning for normal typing like the current model. Wait, there's some bad news... The iPad Pro (2018) will be losing the 3.5mm audio jack and as Apple said during the iPhone 7 series launch, wireless audio connectivity is the way forward. Be ready to shell out for AirPod or any cord-less earphones, if you haven't bought them yet. It can, however, be noted that Macotakara's track record has been known for several hits and misses too, in terms of predicting Apple products. Hence, we urge our readers to take this report with a proverbial pinch of salt. More news on Apple iPad Pro (2018) series is expected to surface in the coming days, as we near Apple's annual product event in September.","

Now, the company might be looking at bringing this new design factor to other products in its portfolio. Apple Watch and iPads are quite popular, even if they do not sell as much as the iPhones. With the new change Apple has in mind for the upcoming Apple Watch Series 4 and iPad Pro, the devices could potentially be the new head-turners in their respective categories. Noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, in his latest research note for investors, outlined the possibilities of seeing a major overhaul in two of Apple's popular products, Apple Watch and iPad Pro. According to Kuo, Apple could minimize bezels on Apple Watch Series 4 and accommodate larger 1.57- and 1.78-inch screens. Based on these predictions, 9to5Mac created visualisations of how these new Watch models would appear when placed side by side with the Series 3 models. The visual representation is bang on, which shows the curved edges of the display essential to eliminate bezels just like in the case of iPhone X. The renders also show larger displays fitted inside the same watch casing as the Series 3. This would improve the usability of the device and have more distinctive text and numerals, which will comparatively reduce the Digital Crown scrolling. The rest of the design is not reimagined, but we would know more only when Apple launches the Series 4 this year. Besides, the bezel-less design form is also embracing the iPads, which generally have generous bezels around the display. That could change with the two new upcoming iPad Pro models. As per Kuo, Apple could launch two new iPad Pro models, one with the 12.9-inch display to replace the current variant of the same size and a new 11-inch model. Even though Apple could significantly trim down the bezels on its upcoming iPads, there is expected to be enough room for Apple to include Face ID sensors and front camera as we've seen in the iPhone X notch. This means the new iPad Pro models will have slimmer bezels without a notch, and the home button with Touch ID. Other predictions laid out by Kuo include several upgrades to the entire Mac line of computers, a new and affordable notebook and mass production of AirPower and new AirPods. With everything in the pipeline, including three new iPhones, it is going to be an interesting time for Apple. Stay tuned for more updates. ","

336,2018-06-30,14:33:51,technology,tablets,iOS 12 beta review: Much-needed refinement with lots of promises," Apple finally released the first version of the public beta of iOS 12 earlier this week, and after a few days of playing with it, I can say that it is indeed a major improvement over iOS 11. Testing the software on a four-year-old iPad Air, I was pleasantly surprised by just how smooth things ran, even for a beta.  Right at the outset, iOS 12 presents a much faster and smoother experience than any other iOS version I have used. Stability for a beta is often questionable, but in this case, Apple has gone out of its way to ensure that this year it is different. Even though I was running a beta on a four-year-old device, animations, boot up, response and apps were much faster.  The battery is a bit of a concern, as my iPad drained down to 20 percent within six hours, but I hope that's just the beta effect. Apart from a few third-party app crashes, we did not notice much that would make me regret downloading the beta. So users will enjoy a far superior experience with iOS 12 when it launches in September, and you don't need the latest shiny iPhone to do so.  With iOS 9, Apple made the iPad stand out as a unique device, giving it a set of unique gestures and features. With iOS 11, the company is going back to merging the user experience of the iPhone and the iPad in a big way. iPhone X gestures for Control Centre, app switching and closing apps come to the iPad making it delightful to use. These are not by mistake, it is clear that Apple is porting over its FaceID to the iPad, and by bringing the iPad UX in-line with the iPhone, the company is making its software universal again. I found these gestures quite easy and intuitive to use despite not having an iPhone X.  Screen Time and the new battery-tracking page are by far my favourite features on iOS 12. Both of these now present data in graphs, making it really easy to see what's going on. Screen Time is not just a gimmick, it really works as I noticed wanting to put the device down after checking data for a few days. There is no doubt that this will go a long way in curbing internet addiction. As for Siri, I haven't yet been able to explore the full functionality of Siri Shortcuts, but it does look like a very promising upgrade. For users who have access to 'Hey Siri' (iPhone 6s and up), this should be far more functional and useful, for older devices not so much unless you actively prefer pressing the home button and invoking Siri.  Porting over a few apps from the iPhone to the iPad is another positive for iOS 12. Since I used the iPad mainly for reading and media, I found the new Stocks and Voice Recorder app to be quite convenient to use. It is a good sign, but only if Apple would give us a weather and calculator app as well! News is perhaps my least favourite update, I found the new sidebar intrusive and annoying as it takes the focus away from the more important contents. In portrait, it can be hidden, but the sidebar is annoyingly omnipresent in ladnscape mode. It reduces the font size of the stories, not really a big advantage. I hope the company makes it hidden in the final release, but until then we will have to live with this intrusion. As for the Photos app, I don't know what to feel about it yet. While it is a much more iOS X like UI, I feel Apple has unnecessarily complicated what was a really good app. The 'For You' tab is now a mix of memories and iCloud photo sharing making it quite cluttered. Maybe it will grow on us with time, but my first experience has not been a good one.  After using iOS 12 for over three days, it is clear that the company is going back to the basics and has produced something wonderful as a result. Innovation should not come at the cost of the user base, and the company has done well to understand this. I still find the single tab in the widgets page annoying, and the sidebar in News is a clearly a bad decision, but overall the UI and UX of iOS 12 make it a pleasant and simple experience, especially on the iPad. When iOS 12 drops in September, it will be the largest release of a mobile operating system and users should download it without hesitation. It is a great update, especially for older devices. ","

This is our biggest books redesign ever, and we hope this beautiful app inspires both customers and authors alike,"" Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Internet Software and Services, said in a statement.

To make the purchase easy and also find good books, it offers dedicated tabs such as Top Charts, Staff Picks, Editorial Collections, and Special Offers and Free. One of the key aspects of the Apple Books is the dedicated Audiobooks tab, which makes iPhones and iPads to read out the books to the users. If you happen to own a car with Apple CarPlay interface, you can listen to the book, while you focus on the driving. Apple claims that the new design let the users swipe between books, and makes discovering something they will love to read intuitive and fun. Over time, as the users read more books from the Store, they will receive personalised recommendations based on their purchases in the 'For You' section. Another interesting feature of the Apple Books is the 'Reading Now' tab. It houses all the books, the users are currently reading or listening to and it also offers insight on some of the popular books liked by the iOS devices users. In the Library tab, users can see their entire collection of books with large, easy-to-see cover art, including the books downloaded to their device and the 'Finished' section showcases all the books the user has read in the past with details of the date they finished them, displayed in a timeline. The new Apple Books app is coming with iOS 12 in September 2018. The company will be offering free e-books in 155 countries. But, the Book Store will available initially in 51 countries and will be expanded to others in coming months.","

342,2018-03-26,20:30:00,technology,tablets,"Apple Education Event 2018 round-up: Expect affordable iPads, Macbooks and more"," Technology major Apple Inc is hosting the company's education event March 27 in Chicago. The program is scheduled at Lane Technical College Prep High School at 10 am CDT (8:30 pm IST). This is the first time since 2012 that Apple is hosting the education event. Back then, it had announced iBooks, an e-book initiation for school kids and teachers. The focus will be on the same demographic this year as well, but the products are expected to be both hardware and software. ""Let's take a field trip. Join us to hear creative new ideas for teachers and students,"" reads the Apple press invitation. Going by the cryptic message and recent reports, Apple is most likely to unveil affordable iPads and MacBooks. More than 70 percent of students and teachers in the US use Google's Chromebooks, Android-based tablets and Microsoft Windows-powered notebooks as study tools. The primary reasons for this are low costs, free applications, and customizations including online tests and teaching. This has always been an Achilles heel for Apple, as most of its products are quite expensive and the options for personalization are very limited. So, parents and education boards are hesitant to teach curricula on iPads and MacBooks. There is also an underlying fact that some tech companies seem have recognized: these very kids will grow up to become future buyers of their products. Thus, Apple needs to act fast to capture this demographic or risk losing future profits. Things may change this year as Apple is expected to bring a pocket-friendly 9.5-inch iPad and also a smaller 7.9-inch iPad Mini. They are expected come with LCD screen but incorporate better CPU processor and battery with longer lifespan compared to the 2017 series. Also, Apple might bring a cheaper Pencil — a stylus for iPads. It is a nifty tool that should help users get more out of the tablets as it enables hand-drawing via dedicated applications — be it drawing pictures, charts or other diagrams or images. The Cupertino giant is also expected to showcase the new MacBook Air, which will be competing with Google Chromebooks. It is said to come with a 13-inch high-resolution screen and a big battery and come with MacOS, along with a host of education-related applications to help students in their project work. Besides the hardware, Apple is also expected to bring dedicated software and application programs. These may include augmented reality (AR)-based applications for both the new iPads and the new MacBook series so children find studying a fun activity and not dread it. Apple is also expected to announce new curricula in collaboration with partner education boards to encourage kids to learn to code, preferably with its proprietary Swift language, via easy-to-understand handbooks and online cloud database. For those unaware, registered and freelance developers use Swift language to create apps for Apple's iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS, as well as Linux-based applications.","

Join us to hear creative new ideas for teachers and students,"" says the Apple invitation leaving nothing much to decipher from the phrase other than the fact that it will be focused on school education. However, recent reports have indicated that Apple might unveil affordable iPads and MacBook Air series. If they are low-priced, many, especially school kids and public schools with low funds, may afford to use them. Also, exactly a year ago, Apple had unveiled the new iPad (2017) series. KGI Securities market analyst Ming-Chi Kuo had also claimed in a letter to his clients earlier this month that Apple is planning to release a new low-priced MacBook series in the second quarter of 2018. All the reports point that Apple is likely to introduce new iPad and MacBook series at the upcoming event in Chicago. The company is expected to bring the 9.5-inch model with LCD screen, but incorporate an upgraded processor and battery life over the 2017 series, so that the device runs longer. On the other hand, Apple is expected to showcase the new MacBook Air as an alternative to Google's Chromebooks, which are already popular among education institutions for its affordable price range. It is believed to come with a 13-inch screen and big battery and a whole lot of education-related applications to help students in project work. Also Augmented Reality (AR)-based applications are also expected come in the new MacBook series. Though there is a lot of chatter on the internet over the iPhone SE (2018) series, Apple is unlikely to use a school to unveil the new smartphone, as many see the mobiles as a distraction in the classroom.

345,2018-02-20,08:50:33,technology,tablets,Apple iOS 11.2.6 update released to iPhones and iPads: Comes with Telugu Unicode bug fix and more," Apple has released a new iOS software with version number 11.2.6 for iPhones and iPads. It is an incremental update and comes with a security update, bug fixes and performance improvements. The new iOS 11.2.6 is an unplanned update release as the company was beta testing iOS 11.3 to address the controversial battery and CPU speed issues in older Apple iPhones, but due to the emergence of the Telugu Unicode bug, the company has been forced to come up with intermediate firmware For those unaware, a Telugu Unicode character had wreaked havoc last week by crashing iMessage, WhatsApp and other messenger apps on iPhones and later in the weekend, the same bug surfaced again, affecting Twitter and Facebook, among other social media applications. Several iPhone owners are reporting that their Twitter app is crashing randomly for no reason. On deeper investigation by tech-savvy users, it was uncovered that some mischief mongers had added the dreaded Telugu (South Indian language) character onto their screen-name on Twitter and started liking random Twitter handles. Once the iPhone Twitter app user received a 'like' notification on the screen, he/she would open Twitter which would lead to the crash. iPhones running on iOS 11 are crashing when a single character in #Telugu is sent to the device or typed in text editor. pic.twitter.com/rlFU04veKG For the uninitiated, the character 'జ్ఞా' pronounced 'gnya' is a Telugu (South Indian language) consonant. Apparently, Apple iPhone's iOS is not able to interpret the meaning which leads to the crash. This issue is mainly faced by iPhones and iPads updated with the latest iOS 11.2.5. Now, with the release of iOS 11.2.6, Apple has fixed the app crashing bug and also rectified another glitch, which causes third-party apps on Apple devices connecting to wireless external accessories. We advise Apple device owners to upgrade to the latest iOS 11.2.6 update as soon as possible. Via OTA (Over-The-Air): via iTunes 1. Back up your iPhone or iPad with either iCloud or via iTunes. 2. Launch iTunes on your Mac or PC. 3. Make sure you're on the latest version of iTunes. Go to About and then Check for Updates or visit iTunes.com. 4. Plug in your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch if it isn't already. 5. Click on iPhone, iPad, or iPod in the top left navigation. 6.

Now, the device has been spotted on a benchmarking website, giving us a glimpse into its key features. The 2017-series Galaxy Tab S3 was a powerful tablet, and most importantly one of the best feature-rich devices with enough power, and also with the best-in-class display [Hands-on REVIEW] to take on the Apple iPad Pro series. Now, its successor will take the battle to the next level. A Samsung device bearing model number SM-T835, understood to be the Galaxy Tab S4, has made a stop at GFXBench, revealing that the device will house the powerful Snapdragon 835 octa-core processor, which can clock up to a staggering 2.3GHz, backed by the Adreno 540 graphics engine, Google's latest Android Oreo software, sumptuous 4GB RAM and 64GB internal storage. It is also said to house a feature-rich 12MP primary camera on the back with dedicated LED flash, full HD (1920x1080p) video recording and HDR (High Dynamic Range) photo-taking capability. On the front, it features a 7MP snapper with full-HD video recording ability. As far as the display is concerned, the Galaxy Tab S4 is expected to sport a massive 10.5-inch display having 2,560x1,600p resolution and five-finger gesture support. Though there is no mention of the type of the screen, the company is expected to feature a top-notch super-AMOLED display, like the ones we see in premium smartphones. Its predecessor's screen is also made of same material. There is no mention of the S-Pen stylus, but it is expected to accompany the Galaxy Tab S4 like the Galaxy Tab S3, which makes the Samsung tablets stand out among rival brands. There is no one in the market that can match the versatility of the S-Pen. It offers multiple functionalities, be it taking notes right on the display, editing videos and images, creating 15-seconds GIFs and many more things. Users need not even open the Notes app with the stylus around. They can start writing on the home page and jot down the notes, as the intuitive Galaxy Tab S series will automatically trigger the application once the user pulls the S-Pen from its socket, like we see the Galaxy Note8 phablet series. Samsung is slated to host Galaxy Unpacked 2018 on February 25, one day ahead of Mobile World Congress (MWC 2018) in Barcelona (February 26-March 1). As said before, fans can expect to witness the launch of the Galaxy S9 (& S9+) and the Galaxy Tab S4 in ord around MWC 2018.","

348,2018-02-06,12:57:50,technology,tablets,Apple still dominates global tablet market as Amazon knocks Samsung down to third place in Q4 2017," Apple continued to be the undisputed leader in the worldwide tablet market in the fourth quarter of 2017 as the company's iPad models were shipped more than any other rival product during the three-month period, according to data published on Monday by International Data Corporation (IDC). The Cupertino-based tech giant managed to maintain a solid lead in the holiday quarter, riding on the success of both its lower-priced 9.7-inch iPad as well as the newly refreshed iPad Pro products. Apple shipped 13.2 million iPads from October through December last year, accounting for a market share of 26.6 percent, according to the latest data from IDC. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the company shipped 13.1 million iPads and owned 24.3 percent of the worldwide tablet market. The company's focus on the iPad Pro should continue in 2018 as the next version of the high-end iPad is also expected to get the Face ID support we see in the iPhone X. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently said adding the new camera technology to the iPad Pro will not only introduce a user experience consistent with the iPhone X, but will also help boost the device's competitiveness. Samsung, however, couldn't retain the second position as Amazon ""was able to steal"" it, thanks to the ""steep discounts"" the company offered during the holiday season. While the low-cost tablets did pretty well for Amazon's online storefront, the company's expansion into other markets across the world as well as the inclusion of Alexa voice assistant in the latest tablets also paid off. Amazon shipped 7.7 million tablets in Q4 2017, up 50.3 percent from the same period in 2016. The shipment growth also took the company's market share from 9.6 percent to 15.6 percent. Samsung, meanwhile, shipped 7 million tablets during the fourth quarter of 2017, accounting for a market share of 14.1 percent. The company suffered a 13 percent annual decline as it managed to ship 8 million tablets in Q4 2016, owning a market share of 14.9 percent. ""Shipments of its detachable portfolio continue to rise, however these gains are outweighed by the declines seen among its slate models. As its lower-cost Tab A and E series is challenged by vendors promising better value, Samsung will face a particular challenge in upgrading its base to both a higher-priced and detachable device,"" IDC said. Huawei and Lenovo rounded out the top five list with 7.1 percent and 6.2 percent market share, respectively. Overall, the 49.6 million tablets were shipped during the period, down 7.9 percent from 53.8 million from the last quarter of 2016. However, when it comes to the entire year of 2017, Samsung (15.2 percent) was still at the second position after Apple (26.8 percent). Amazon (10.2 percent) made it to the third position, followed by Huawei (7.7 percent) and Lenovo (6.3 percent).","

You will probably contact the service centre –wrong – all you need to do is to put it in an ice box. Some Surface Pro 4 owners have claimed that they are facing trouble with the screen of the device, and named the problem Flickergate. The owners are now also discussing the issue on Microsoft's support forum. At least 1,600 Surface Pro 4 users are facing this Flickergate issue. However, the big problem is that there are many owners whose Surface Pro 4 is no longer under warranty.  Microsoft, on the other hand, says that it is aware of the screen flickering issue and the developers in Redmond are closely monitoring the situation. ""We are aware that some customers have experienced a screen flicker on Surface Pro 4 and are monitoring the situation closely,"" a Microsoft spokesperson said. Usually, this issue occurs when the tablet is hot. So, for getting rid of this issue (temporarily), owners have started putting their slates into icebox (freezer) so that the device cools down and prevent the flickering screen issue. According to a user, every 10 minutes of a trip to the freezer gets him 30 minutes of flicker-free use. A video on YouTube also shows that method to solve the flickering issue. It now seems that it is not a software issue which can be solved by a software update. Currently, it is affecting less than 1 percent of the devices. Some users with out-of-warranty have also paid $800 to Microsoft to fix the hardware issue on the device. ""Surface Pro's are marketed and priced as premium devices, ""Microsoft should, therefore, respond accordingly by acknowledging the issue and offering a solution. If the issue is a hardware fault, then Microsoft should recall affected devices,"" The Verge quoted the Flickergate group as saying. Previously, attorneys at Migliaccio & Rathod LLP had won a class action case against Lenovo for defective laptops. The law firm is also investigating Microsoft's Surface Pro 3 battery failures and has also received complaints about the Surface Pro 4 flickering screen.  ","

Now, the American technology behemoth has finally made up its mind to release the successor, the Surface Book 2 in India. Microsoft Surface Book 2 is a unique laptop in several aspects. It is a hybrid device, which can detach itself from the keyboard and work seamlessly as a touch-screen tablet, all thanks to armadillo-inspired 'dynamic fulcrum hinge' and innovative 'muscle wire locks', which help in easy detachment of the display from the keyboard. The new Microsoft Surface Book sports 13.5-inch PixelSense display similar to the 2016-seroes and also comes with bigger 15-inch size as well.

Under-the-hood, Surface Book 2 houses a more powerful, faster and more efficient SoC (System-on-Chip) than ever before. It comes with 7th Gen Intel Core i5/8th Gen Intel Core i7 processors and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 and 1060 discrete graphics options. With such top-notch hardware, Surface Book 2 is said to be five times more powerful than the original and is twice as powerful as the latest MacBook Pro, Microsoft claims. The Surface Book 2 also supports Surface Pen with tilt and 4096 levels of pressure sensitivity for amazing inking as well as Surface Dial on-screen, making it more versatile than any rival brand in its class. For those unaware, Surface Dial is a new peripheral designed in a shape of a hockey puck, which has to be placed right on the Surface Studio screen. It integrates with Windows 10 to work with Surface for a faster and more intuitive way to scroll, zoom and navigate. It is backed by 8GB/16RAM and with such top-notch configurations, Surface Book 2 is well equipped to support 3D gaming, mixed reality and capable of performing functions seamlessly in others forms of work. Furthermore, Surface Book 2 will come with all-day battery life – up to 17 hours of video playback. That's 70 percent more than the latest MacBook Pro, the company noted.

The videos are titled ""Augment Reality"" and ""Take Notes,"" are short and are both the commercials of not more than 15 seconds. The first advertisement focuses on the iPad Pro's augmented reality (AR) apps based on Apple's new ARKit platform for iOS 11. In the first advertisement, we see a scout riding her bike in the park where a bench captures her attention. She sees a man sitting on the bench reading a newspaper. The scout pulls out her iPad Pro and drops a couch and a table in front of the bench with the help of AR. It makes it appears like the man has brought his living-room furniture to the park. The second advertisement focused on how you can use the Apple Pencil in a creative way to make multimedia notes on an iPad Pro running on iOS 11. It shows the same scout. This time she is not riding her bike in the park but sitting on a tree branch. She is now making some multimedia notes using the iPad Pro's ability to draw, type, or drag and drop pictures from the Apple's Files app. Apple has already used some clips from this advertisement for its ""What's a Computer?"" ad, which was launch in November 2017.

352,2018-01-14,14:36:59,technology,tablets,Android Oreo release update: These two T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy devices confirmed get new Google mobile OS v8.0," Samsung, which is slated to release the Android Oreo update to flagships Galaxy S8, S8+ and Note8 series soon, will be extending the OS to two other lesser-known devices later this year. The company has not acknowledged any plan to release Google's new mobile OS v8.0, but its official US carrier partner, T-Mobile, has confirmed it. The telecom company has listed the mid-range Galaxy J7 Prime (SM-J727TZDATMO) and tablet Galaxy Tab E 8 (SM-T377TZKATMB) series as devices that will get Android Oreo. ""T-Mobile and the device manufacturer (Samsung) have agreed to support a new software update (Android Oreo),"" the firm said on the website. However, there is no word on when the company intends to release the software update. This is a welcome gesture, as device-makers are often known to show stepmotherly treatment to non-flagship devices. With the announcement, Samsung is trying to win over loyal fans and also attract more consumers to its fold. It will be great if other Android-affiliated brands embrace Samsung's initiative. Android Oreo brings a boatload of improvements over Android Nougat, such as faster booting and more fluid experiences to phones and tablets, as well as improvements in security via Google Play Protect that checks suspicious activities and malware in the application. One notable attribute of Android Oreo is the Rescue Party feature, which helps the device recover from constant boot loops. It also extends battery life by cutting down on unnecessary activities of apps in the background. It also comes with new features such as picture-in-picture, which allows users to do two tasks simultaneously, like checking the calendar while planning a party on a Duo video call. Its Smart Text Selection improves copy and paste. With the help of machine learning to recognise entities on the screen—like a complete address—users will be able to easily select text they want with a double tap, and even bring up an app like Maps to help during navigation. During the ongoing Galaxy S8 series beta-testing, Samsung, in addition to Google Android Oreo features, is adding its own custom features to enhance user-experience, which includes new clock styles for both the lock screen and Always on Display, and Smart View — which lets the mobile phone's display turn dark when mirroring the content on large TV screen, thus saving battery draining. However, only a few features come to the Galaxy J7 Prime and the Galaxy Tab E 8 due to hardware limitations.","

355,2017-12-07,12:10:06,technology,tablets,Mi Pad–iPad trademark lawsuit: Apple wins against Xiaomi in EU court," US-based Apple Inc has won a lawsuit against Xiaomi in EU court thereby preventing the Chinese tech giant from registering Mi Pad as a trademark in Europe.  Apple's iPad and Xiaomi's Mi Pad are both tablet devices. The General Court, European Union's second-highest court, in its ruling stated that Mi Pad shouldn't be registered as a trademark because consumers may get confused by the similarity of signs, Reuters reported. ""The dissimilarity between the signs at issue, resulting from the presence of the additional letter 'm' at the beginning of ""Mi Pad"", is not sufficient to offset the high degree of visual and phonetic similarity between the two signs,"" the Court said in a statement. Back in 2014, the Chinese tech giant filed an application with EU Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) for registering Mi Pad as an EU  trademark. However, Apple contended that move and lodged a complaint following which EUIPO upheld in 2016 that English speaking consumers would misread 'Mi' as 'My' in Mi Pad which sounds similar to iPad and might assume it to be another trademark of Apples's iPad.  The decision came three years after Xiaomi filed the application with the European Union Intellectual Property Office to register Mi Pad as a trademark. The European Union Intellectual Property Office took Apple's side, based on the fact that Mi Pad could be misunderstood as a variation of the iPad trademark. ""The court agreed with the EUIPO's decision and said English-speaking consumers were likely to understand the prefix ""mi"" as meaning ""my"" and therefore pronounce the ""i"" of Mi Pad and iPad in the same way,"" the news agency reported. Still, Xiaomi can appeal against the ruling at the EU's highest court, the Court of Justice of the European Union. So far there is no statement by the Chinese mobile maker on the decision taken by the General Court of European Union.","

356,2017-12-02,12:54:50,technology,tablets,Apple will launch cheapest ever 9.7-inch iPad in second quarter of 2018: Report," Apple raised many eyebrows when it introduced a $329 9.7-inch iPad for the first time in March earlier this year. If a new report is to be believed, the Cupertino-based tech giant is planning for a similar surprise by releasing a new iPad model next year that will be even more inexpensive. Apple is apparently planning a new 9.7-inch iPad that is expected to be $70 cheaper than the existing model of the device. The new iPad, which is likely to be introduced by Apple in the second quarter of 2018, could cost around $259 in a bid to attract price-conscious consumers and help the company maintain its present tablet shipment of 10 million units a quarter, DigiTimes reported on Friday. ""With the new device, the sources expect the tablet market to witness a new wave of price competition among first-tier players including Samsung Electronics, Amazon, Huawei and Lenovo,"" the report said, adding that Apple could also expand the cheaper iPad into the industrial and service sectors. It's currently unclear if the new $259 iPad would be available alongside the $329 model, or if it would eventually replace its predecessor. Although the technical specifications of the device are still unknown, it is reportedly expected to be a slightly-tweaked version of the existing 2017 iPad. Apple claimed in its November earnings call that its tablet business managed to find success with double-digit unit growth in sales for the second quarter in a row. The company, however, didn't provide a breakdown of sales across its tablet models. In the June quarter, Apple said it had sold 11.4 million iPads, accounting for an increase of 15 percent over the same period a year ago. The company's iPad revenue was also up during the period, suggesting that it was selling a fair amount of lower-priced iPads. However, the worldwide tablet market has been in decline for the past few years, which has apparently triggered fears in the Apple camp, forcing the company to devise an aggressive pricing strategy to counterbalance the continuing overall decline.","

358,2017-11-15,12:58:47,technology,tablets,AI-based Google Assistant might finally come to Android tablets," After months of neglect, it looks like Google has finally made its mind to release the Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based Google Assistant to Android tablets. After making the debut with Pixel (1st gen) phones in 2016, the search engine giant's much-hyped Google Assistant made its way to third-party branded Android phones in the first quarter of 2017 and later introduced it to Apple iOS devices, but sadly it never made it to the big-screen Android tablets. To make things worse, Google launched Chrome-based notebooks with Google Assistant support and smart Android TVs with similar settings for users to trigger the voice command feature. It gave credence to rumours of Android tablets heading for a slow death and the company increasingly sidelining the particular product category, which apparently has failed to give a stiff challenge to Apple iPads. But, a new Google beta app v7.14, which was released to testers has shown support for Google Assistant in Android tablets, giving a ray of hope for Android tablet owners to experience the Google Assistant soon. In the Home control option in the Settings, we can see Google Assistant support for Google Home, Android 6.0+ based phones, tablets, Chromebooks, smartwatches and smart TVs, hinting that the company will be adding the support for tablets in upcoming Google App update. As said before, Google Assistant is powered by an AI algorithm, which is said to be more superior to Apple's Siri and Microsoft's Cortana. Owners can interact with their device in two mediums- texting and vocally – via Google Assistant. In layman terms, Android device users can communicate with Google Assistant like a normal one-on-one conversation with another person and can continue the conversation as long as they want. For instance, users can invoke Google Assistant feature just by saying 'OK Google' and ask for direction to a destination, hail an Uber cab on the go, search nearby restaurant, set alarms and do other stuff in different contexts and situations seamlessly by just speaking to it. Another cool (for some, it may be creepy) aspect of Google Assistant, is that it listens to every conversation you make on the Pixel phone. For instance, if the Pixel user is chatting on Google Allo messenger app with a friend, about a plan to have lunch later in the day or go to an event sometime in the week. Google Assistant, which is continuously working in the background, would have already searched for hotel reservations or ticket-booking option for that particular show. Users just need to long press the home button, to see this information. In select countries, users can even send money via voice on Google Assistant. The company has also released a new update to make the digital butler identify music like Shazam. Google Assistant is also intuitive enough to learn the behaviour of the device owner over time and improve its service. The company will continue to add more functionalities to the digital assistant in the future.","

360,2022-03-07,02:20:49,technology,internet,Russia's Yandex warns of bond repayment and supply risks," Russian internet giant Yandex on Friday warned that a trading suspension on its Nasdaq-listed shares could trigger a redemption right on a convertible bond that it does not have the resources to cover. Unprecedented Western sanctions over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine have hammered Russia's financial system and investors have dumped Russian assets from the rouble to bonds and stocks. Yandex said that a suspension of trading of its Class A shares on Nasdaq of more than five trading days would give holders of those notes the right to require Yandex to redeem them at par plus accrued interest under the terms of its 0.75% convertible notes due in 2025. ""The current principal amount outstanding is $1.25 billion. In the event that such redemption right was triggered, we would be required to issue a notice within five calendar days informing the holders of the notes of their redemption rights,"" Yandex said in a statement. ""The Yandex group as a whole does not currently have sufficient resources to redeem the notes in full."" SUPPLY CONCERNS Yandex has avoided sanctions, but like all Russian companies it has suffered reputational damage. Lithuania asked tech companies to remove the app for Yandex's ride-hailing service from their stores this week.   ""None of Yandex N.V., any of our subsidiaries, any of the members of our board of directors or management or any of our principal shareholders is a target of these sanctions,"" Yandex said. However, the company said the suspension of supplies and services to Russia by a number of foreign companies could adversely affect some of its operations over time. ""We believe that our current data centre capacity and other technology critical to operations will allow us to operate normally for at least the next 12 to 18 months,"" it said. Companies ceasing shipments of consumer goods to Russia could also reduce its e-commerce offering, Yandex said.   The company said it is aware of speculation that the Russian government may try to take control of companies or assets in Russia in response to sanctions. Yandex competitor VK became state-controlled late last year. ""Although we are not aware of any plans in this regard, the majority of our operations and assets are located in Russia and therefore any such action would have a material adverse impact on the value of the Yandex group as a whole.""","

361,2021-07-26,18:20:20,technology,internet,India ranks lowest on global mobile data cost and that's great news [here's how]," India's mobile data consumption figures are mind-boggling. Reliance Jio, which is the most disruptive telecom provider in the country, witnessed over 2 exabytes of data consumed in the first quarter this year, which translates to over 2 million terabytes of mobile data used in just three months. The competition brought on by Jio brought a significant change in how mobile data is sold, forcing Airtel, Vodafone and other telcos to follow the suit and compete aggressively. With this, Indian mobile users were benefited with ultra-affordable mobile data, so cheap that no other country in the world matches what Indian telcos offer. Comparing the mobile data rates in different countries shows India leads with the lowest cost, which is mainly driven by intense market competition. On one hand, Indian telecoms are offering 1GB mobile data at $0.09 or Rs 6.7, there are countries that go as high as $27 per GB. In fact, in 2018, India offered 1GB data at $0.3 or Rs 18.5, but the data offered by telcos now is about 65 percent cheaper. Why low cost data is great news? Reliance Jio, Airtel, Vodafone Idea are engaged in a cut-throat competition in offering the best data plans in a bid to retain old customers and gain new ones. With the affordability of 4G, there's an advent of a new digital age, in line with the government's vision of a Digital India. The smartphone market has flourished, giving way for many OEMs such as Xiaomi, Samsung, Oppo, Vivo, OnePlus, Apple and many more. Digital literacy has also increased manifold as a direct impact of the slashed prices of mobile data. By offering affordable data to consumers, the digital infrastructure enables ease of access to services like banking, governance and more. India has also been pushing on digital empowerment, for which having affordable mobile data even in the remotest parts of the country furthers the mission. How much 1GB data costs in other countries? Visual Capitalist put together a graph, sourcing data from Cable.co.UK, which shows Israel ($0.11), Kyrgyzstan ($0.21), Italy ($0.43) and Ukraine ($0.46) are the countries where 1GB mobile data is cheaper than any other country. The difference between the cheapest price for data and most expensive one is a staggering 30,000 percent. Malawi tops the list of offering the most expensive data at $27.41 per GB, followed by Benin ($27.22), Chad ($23.33), Yemen ($15.98) and Botswana ($13.87). In countries like Canada and Greece, per GB cost for mobile data is over $12. The high market concentration in Canada explains the high cost. Bell Rogers and Telus collectively dominate the Canada's telecom industry, leaving little room for disruption and competition. In the US, the cost of 1GB is $8, which is still above the global average of over $5 per GB.","

362,2021-06-30,19:33:37,technology,internet,What is BharatNet; India's public broadband network to run PPP model [see benefits]," In a major boost to Indian government's aim to digitise India, the Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the revised implementation strategy of BharatNet through Public-Private Partnership mode in 16 states. BharatNet will now extend up to all inhabited villages beyond Gram Panchayats (GPs) in these states — Kerala, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura, Nagaland, and Arunachal Pradesh. An estimated 3.61 lakh villages including GPs will be covered. The approval comes after Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the revised strategy and the additional allocation on Monday. Sitharaman announced that the government will make an additional outlay of over Rs 19,000 crore for the BharatNet project aimed at broadband connectivity in rural India. The revised strategy also includes creation, upgradation, operation, maintenance and utilisation of BharatNet by the concessionaire who will be selected by a competitive international bidding process. What is BharatNet? BharatNet programme was earlier known as National Optical Fibre Network, initiated by Manmohan Singh-led UPA government with an aim to connect 2,50,000 Gram Panchayats across the country. It is considered to be the biggest rural telecom project in the world and is an integral part of the central government's Digital India initiative. Under BharatNet programme, the government aims to provide at least 100Mbps speeds to each Gram Panchayat in order to avail online services, such as e-governance, e-learning, e-banking, e-commerce and e-health services. Since BharatNet is now open to private players, it has its own set of advantages. It will bring the following: As per government data, more than 1.56 lakh out of 2.5 lakh gram panchayats have already been connected and are service-ready. An estimated 3.61 lakh villages including Gram Panchayats will be covered. With the additional outlay of Rs 19,041 crore, the total outlay for the much ambitious project would be Rs 61,109 crore including the already approved amount of Rs 42,068 crore in 2017. The initiative which is implemented in a public-private partnership model has been delayed to a great extent and has missed deadlines so far.","

363,2020-12-03,01:38:23,technology,internet,Trump wants Section 230 terminated. Problem: Prez stands to lose more," U.S President Donald Trump has been crying foul. Blaming Twitter for sending out ""false trends,"" after a hashtag targeting the outgoing commander-in-chief continued to trend in the nation for several hours. What's more? Trump further accused the microblogging site Twitter of making up only negative stuff. Before adding that Section 230 must be repealed in the interest of national security. In the latest development, Trump also threatens to veto the defense bill unless Congress repeals Section 230. Yes, the law that protects social media companies and is a major legal shield for tech giants. Ironically, Trump made the statement in a series of tweets. ""Section 230, which is a liability shielding gift from the U.S to ""Big Tech"" (the only companies in America that have it --- corporate welfare!), is a serious threat to our National Security & Election Integrity. Our country can never be safe & secure if we allow it to stand..."" he tweeted, before adding, ""Therefore, if the very dangerous & unfair Section 230 is not completely terminated as part of the National Defence Authorisation Act (NDAA), I will be forced to unequivocally VETO the Bill when sent to the very beautiful Resolute desk. Take back America NOW. Thank you!"" What is Section 230? Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA) of 1996 is one of the most vital and valuable tools in the hands of the Internet for protecting its freedom of expression. It is ironic since the original purpose of the legislation was to restrict free speech on the Internet. Section 230 says, ""No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider."" Simply put, it means that online intermediaries that host or republish speech are protected against a range of laws that would otherwise make them liable for what others say and do. A lot of people mistake the platform for the publisher. Section 230 puts no prohibitions on editing, censoring, altering illegal content. It just observes that the author of self-published content is the publisher and not the platform. What? Look who's talking  Unless some major point is being missed in it all, wouldn't a repeal result in the immediate removal of Trump from all the social media platforms? Maybe it didn't occur to Trump himself but it didn't take long for social media users to take stock of the situation. ""If trump successfully removed Section 230, wouldn't that make him the biggest liability to Twitter's platform?...and they would be within their rights to protect their own company from that risk by removing him?"" observed a user. While political satirist Mark Russell pointed out in his tweet, ""This would accomplish the opposite of what he thinks it would. Social media platforms would then be forced to mediate all their content, knowing they could be held liable for things he and other users say."" Replying to @Donald Trump Michigan representative Justin Amash was among the first ones to quash Donald Trump's post. ""False. Section 230 applies to everyone on the internet, including traditional media, The Trump Organisation, him, you, and me. In fact, it became law before most social media existed. It promotes the freedom of speech by ensuring you're not liable for things *other* people say."" To be clear, Mr. President, Section 230 repeal wasn’t included in the House OR Senate version of the NDAA.You’re mad at Twitter. We all know it.You're willing to veto the defense bill over something that has everything to do with your ego, and nothing to do with defense. https://t.co/qsELyzU9O0 #DiaperDonald got mad that #DiaperDonald trended # 1 for two days.

364,2020-11-12,02:20:36,technology,internet,After backing 4 trillion files to Google Photos; it's time to slow down or start paying," Google, for years, offered free unlimited photo and video uploads and backups in a compressed format through its Photos app, but all that goodness comes to an end next year. Starting June 1, 2021, Google Photos will no longer offer free unlimited backup, and any files uploaded after that will be a part of the 15GB default cloud storage users get with a new Google account. Google Photos product lead David Lieb explained the reason behind the company's decision in a series of tweets, which simply translates to the growing demand for storage. After acknowledging the fact that Google Photos, since 2015, gave 1 billion people a private place to keep all their photos and videos, it's time for a change. And a big one at that. Google Photos - end of free reign Lieb said, users have so far uploaded 4 trillion photos and videos and that number is only increasing by 28 billion files every week. After dropping this bomb, Google was quick to note that existing photos and videos uploaded in ""high quality"" before June 1, 2021, will not count towards the storage limit. But anything after that date will eat into your measly 15GB allotment. Google says even with the change, ""over 80 percent of you should still be able to store roughly three more years worth of memories with your free 15 GB of storage."" The solution - Google's way So what happens after you reach that limit? The simple answer is to pay up. Google One plans are readily available for you to continue uploading files to Google Photos, which is off-limits for Google's advertising purposes. That's one (and good) reason. Alternatively, if you own a Pixel phone, that free, unlimited backup for your photos and videos for the set period remains unaffected by this change. If you haven't checked up on your content on Google Photos for over two years, Google may delete your content across multiple services. So, it might be a good time to take a walk down memory lane. Google is also trying to help you (sort of). Next year, the web giant is going to offer a utility tool inside Photos that will help you identify dark, blurry photos and large videos that are unnecessarily eating up your cloud space.","

365,2020-09-02,16:59:56,technology,internet,"What is Pacific Light Cable Network and why did Google, Facebook drop plans for it"," Amidst the growing trade tensions between the US and China, the US government committee known as ""Team Telecom"" has now stalled development of the Pacific Light Cable Network project and rejected approval for setting up of the cable network on national security grounds. What is the Pacific Light Cable Network? Around the world, there are hundreds of undersea cables providing internet connectivity to people and companies across the globe. This new underwater cable project was announced in 2016, backed by Google and Facebook connecting the US to Hong Kong, which if implemented will boost internet speed and capacity. According to a statement from Google, ""The Pacific Light Cable Network (PLCN) will have 12,800 km (8,000 miles) of fiber and an estimated cable capacity of 120 Tbps, making it the highest-capacity trans-Pacific route, a record currently held by another Google-backed cable system, FASTER. In other words, PLCN will provide enough capacity for Hong Kong to have 80 million concurrent HD video conference calls with Los Angeles."" If implemented, this undersea cable project will be the sixth submarine cable in which Google has an ownership stake — joining the ranks of the Unity, SJC, FASTER, MONET and Tannat projects. With millions of dollars being invested into setting up the undersea cable project, it would have portions connecting the US with Taiwan and the Philippines, and needs approval to be operational. Google owns the branch connecting Taiwan, Facebook owns the branch connecting Philippines, and Hong Kong-based Pacific Light Data Company (PLDC) owns the rest. Dr Peng group, a Chinese broadband giant is one of the other companies working alongside Facebook and Google on the cable network. The US government's Team Telecom has recommended approval for the Taiwan and Philippines sections of the cable network project but plans to connect Hong Kong have been stalled on grounds of national security concerns raised. Why did the US government reject the Pacific Light Cable Network project? A spokesperson for Google had earlier told BBC, ""We can confirm that the original application for the PLCN cable system has been withdrawn, and a revised application for the US-Taiwan and US-Philippines portions of the system has been submitted. We continue to work through established channels to obtain cable landing licenses for our undersea cables."" Some of the reasons cited by Team Telecom include: In the Covid-19 times and growing trade tensions between the US and China on many fronts, the final decision from the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on the above matter is awaited. Chinese trading mechanisms and intellectual property theft has always been under the US government scanner. With President Trump assuming office, billions of dollars' worth of tariffs were imposed on Chinese goods. Trump said in May, ""China has replaced one country, two systems, with one country, one system."" He further intends to remove Hong Kong's privileged status in US law. Will this decision prove counterproductive for the US? The very reason why the underwater sea cable was meant to connect Hong Kong with Los Angeles was that Hong Kong was to become an Asian hub and US tech firms could gain access to more Asian customers via the Hong Kong route. However, now since the plans have been stalled, it seems like the US government has shot itself in its own foot by worrying about data security, leaks and hacks from the Chinese tech giants. While the US Department of Justice concerns China accessing user data is understandable, but by doing so the US tech companies are losing out on penetrating into the Asia Pacific region and would not be able to target the Asian customers. In another allegation against China, Google founder Eric Schmidt had earlier told BBC that Huawei is engaged in unacceptable acts and posing challenges to national security. Eric referred to Huawei as means of signals intelligence, as performed by spy agencies like the UK's GCHQ or NSA in the US. Will strong Anti-China prejudices promote growth? New subsea cable plans connecting Chile to Australia supersedes China's proposal  Meanwhile, the Chilean government has recently announced plans for the development of its Transoceanic Cable, 13,180 km long cable network that will link Chile to Sydney and Auckland. This will make Chile, the digital hub of the South American nation on the Pacific side. With initial investment estimated to be around $500 million, the bidding for the contract will begin next year. With China being under political fire this year, the Japanese-backed investment supersedes Chinese plans to make Shanghai, the next final destination for the subsea cable. It suggests Australia and New Zealand be the landing targets as they will require the shortest cable network deployment, thus offering excellent interconnectivity. Australia in particular has many subsea cables throughout Oceania and Asia, including one from Tokyo which has been operational since July. Setting up this cable network will give Japanese companies a competitive winning edge when it comes to procuring related equipment contracts, such as NEC for example, is a major supplier of subsea cables.","

Anyone who joined JioFiber between August 15-30 also get 30-day free trial. Reliance JioFiber vs competition Reliance JioFiber's new plans are fiercely competitive. In comparison, Airtel Xstream's base plan starts at Rs 799 for 100Mbps speed with 150GB data cap for a month. Reliance JioFiber does that and more in just Rs 699. Airtel's Rs 999 plan gives 200Mbps speeds with an additional charge of Rs 200 to get unlimited data. Airtel has an edge here with the speed. Then there's another Airtel plan at Rs 1,499, which gives 300Mbps speeds, but Jio does the same with unlimited data.","

367,2020-08-22,18:31:39,technology,internet,World's fastest internet can download entire Netflix library in a second," Imagine being able to download the entire Netflix library and the time it would take with the current internet speeds. We are not talking about one particular movie or an entire season of your favorite TV show. Imagine being able to download everything there is on Netflix - most of it you didn't even know existed - in less than one second. What if we told you that's possible with the world's fastest internet that's thousand times faster than the fastest broadband currently available in the market. Researchers at the University College London have recorded the world's fastest internet speed at an insane 178 terabits per second (Tbps). To put things into perspective, that's 178,000 Gbps. Moreover, the minimum internet speed in India is 2Mbps and there are commercially available broadband services offering as high as 1Gbps. Yep. The world's fastest internet is 178,000 times faster than the fastest Gigafiber broadband available in India. World's fastest internet ""At this speed, it would take less than an hour to download the data that made up the world's first image of a black hole (which, because of its size, had to be stored on half a ton of hard drives and transported by plane). The speed is close to the theoretical limit of data transmission set out by American mathematician Claude Shannon in 1949,"" the researchers explained. At 178Tbps, UCL researchers have set a world record. The project was conducted by Dr Lidia Galdino from the Royal Academy of Engineering, Xtera and Kiddi Research. The researchers also noted the biggest benefit of the technique, which can be deployed on already existing infrastructure. To make the current setup capable of delivering the insane speeds is by upgrading the amplifiers that are located on optical fibre routes at 40-100km intervals. Upgrading is more cost-effective compared to installing new optical fibres. Sadly, it's not available commercially and it's not likely to be available anytime soon. So put a pin on your plans to download all of Netflix content.","

368,2020-08-12,21:35:23,technology,internet,Google Search went crazy after massive glitch in its indexing system," Google is the go-to source for any web search - so much so that the term ""google"" is often referred to as doing an internet search. But what happens when the primary search engine goes bonkers. If you think that's impossible, well, think again. On Monday afternoon, Google Search delivered unusual results that did not match the search term. While many thought it was some sort of an update, it was realised later that Google messed up, albeit briefly. Google acknowledged the problem and patched the bugs soon after. But for the short while that Google Search went crazy, people couldn't help but call out the glitch. ""On Monday we detected an issue with our indexing systems that affected Google search results. Once the issue was identified, it was promptly fixed by our Site Reliability Engineers and by now it has been mitigated. What happened? Google has a web crawling and indexing system called Caffeine that processes data transfer. The system helps Google continually index the entire web in real-time. Users pointed out how bad results plagued web search. Recipe Blog SEO Casey Markee shared screenshots of examples, which showed irrelevant results for ""baked beans."" Google's Gary Illyes explained the role of Caffeine and how it affects web search. ""If something goes wrong with most of the things that it's supposed to do, that will show downstream in some way. If scheduling goes awry, crawling may slow down. If rendering goes wrong, we may misunderstand the pages. If index building goes bad, ranking & serving may be affected,"" Illyes explained. In order to fix the glitch, Google had to rebuild the whole serving index in a matter of hours. Thankfully, the issue has been resolved and there's no chance it could occur again (hopefully).","

With its services spread across various spectrums of the digital world, from emails to web search and more, Google user data is infinite. But the web search titan is mulling for more - through an appealing scheme of giving them a digital identity - one that can be accessed by everyone. Google's new People Cards lure millions of people into giving away their precious information about themselves - voluntarily. What are People Cards? In simple terms, People Cards are digital visiting cards that can be found with a single web search using Google. The feature allows influencers, entrepreneurs, freelancers, or pretty much anyone to be found easily online. It's more or less like when you search for a famous personality or celebrity to read up about them, now people can do that about you. ""It's not always easy to find the person or information that you're looking for. After all, there are many people who share the same name, and it's hard to know who's who on the internet,"" Lauren Clark, Product Manager at Google Search, said. This is where Google's new feature comes into play. The feature is currently available only in India and available in English only. The reason for introducing the feature in the world's second largest internet market is a result of a popular trend where people look up their own names on the search engine. There are no plans to expand the feature's availability to other markets. How to create People Cards? The process is quite simple really. Follow the steps below.","

370,2020-07-24,19:24:24,technology,internet,Will Twitter become unaffordable for voiceless; no clarity on subscription model," Twitter has always been heralded as a platform not restricting anyone from joining it, a space to chat and express. However, the whole dialogue on the app might change, even the demography might in the coming months. On July 23rd, the company announced that it is 'exploring' subscription models for its users. This move is a result of the pandemic, which has hit every sector and company hard. Twitter has witnessed a sharp fall in ad revenues. However, this asks a question, what does it mean for us? Twitter CEO on subscription-based platform It's unimaginable for people on the internet to think about paying for Twitter. The 'free' aspect of Twitter is what allows it to soar across the globe. However, this might not be the case for very long.  The company recently came off its quarter one with its reports. Interestingly while it's user base expanded sizeably in Q1, with 186 million active users on a daily basis. Still, the company reported an operating loss of $124 million with a slow down in ad revenues in the first quarter.  Total revenues also showed a decrease of 19% due to the pandemic. Added to this in the US revenues slowed down for the company due to civil unrest in May-June. This might lead to a shift in the way the platform operates here onwards.  Further, in an investor call, CEO Jack Dorsey said, ""you will likely see some tests this year."" He emphasised that ""a really high bar for when we would ask consumers to pay for aspects of Twitter."" But, ""We want to make sure any new line of revenue is complementary to our advertising business,"" Dorsey said, reported CNN.  What does this mean for Twitter users? Should users of the platform like us be on guard? Since nothing is yet concretised, we can't really know if we'll wake up tomorrow to open Twitter tomorrow only to find that we have to subscribe to it. In a post-pandemic world where everything has turned virtual, we can't expect that the internet will stay free.  Moreover, platforms and social media platforms at that drive interaction and a sense of community, turning into paid services raises the question of where can one express themselves at a cost of more than just personal embarrassment.  IBTimes reached out to netizens to float the idea of whether people would pay to use services on Twitter to those who use the platform regularly and those who use it occasionally. However, there was a general consensus communicated in the process that the majority of netizens didn't feel they would pay for services on the platform as it is currently if it were to go down that route. Some said they don't see the point of paying for something they don't use often, and important tweets usually make it to other platforms in a matter of hours, so paying to see something that will be eventually carried didn't seem appealing. Another viewpoint was that not all the information on the platform is particularly reliable and so paying for Twitter, didn't seem like something they would go for, anonymous users said.  It also begs the questions if people are willing to pay to use the platform. That still remains uncertain. For many people the platform has become a window to a much larger world for identities to sustain themselves, to suddenly have to pay to curate one's online space would seem rather ironic.  The concept of subscription-based models for platforms to create revenue streams is not new and will continue, content, of course, has never been entirely free. But, will your voice and medium to express have to become paid for? That's a scary question to ask. ","

Considering significant job losses and layoff of workers in the recent months, scammers and hoax callers are making the most of the crisis times by targeting individuals actively looking out for opportunities with fake job offer emails and hoax calls, asking them to pay a certain sum to get a job offer or say an ID card, or any other material. Should you fall prey to such job scam emails? What you should or can do? Don't fall prey to the lure! Well, take this up legally for one. Shout out with posts and raise an alarming call on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and the likes, as Shagzil Khan exactly did by reaching out to people on social media and verifying if the Indigo Airlines Hyderabad is currently recruiting ground staffers. A sure shot approach that will draw the attention of the crowd to such scams under circulation, and help the victim get quick ready advice from people, sharing their experiences on scam emails and why nobody should divulge confidential account information to the hoax caller such as full name, credit or debit card information and OTP, residential address, etc. Sharing a copy of the offer letter from Indigo Airlines on social media, the Facebook user brought to light, how scam emails look like - as real as it can get for anyone to be fooled. But do not go blind by the deluded reality. How to identify and know if the email is a ""scam""? Never share your credit or debit card details with anyone. No authentic job offer email will ask you to deposit money for issuance of ID cards and supply of material. It's plain common sense. Apply your mind before you reply to such emails.

373,2020-04-15,20:13:02,technology,internet,Struggling with Slow Internet Speed? Here's How You Can Ramp It Up," The new work-from-home lifestyle has increased dependence on the internet, taxing the web. According to the experts, India's per capita internet consumption has increased by 45% due to countrywide lockdown now extended till May 3.  Even though most people have accepted the new social order marked by quarantines and social distancing measures, even if reluctantly, one thing that everyone unanimously agrees is that self-isolation would have become worse without the internet. No Quarantine Without Internet One of the biggest casualties of the coronavirus pandemic during this period of lockdown has been the internet speeds across the world. Since every home these days is packed with multiple devices, the internet speed is taking a beating. This is the reason most streaming services have reduced the video quality for default streaming to put less pressure on internet service providers. According to Ookla, the download speeds of fixed broadband lines have fallen sharply for the month of March. For people dependent on the internet for their work or online classes, the following tips will help ensure stable connectivity. Turn off the VPN If the streaming service on your smart TV is working fine but the webpages take forever to load, then your VPN may be at fault. Most enterprises require their employees to use the VPN in order to access official documents, Content Management Systems, etc. However, very often the VPN slows down the internet speed significantly. The situation can be remedied by simply turning off the VPN. Basic Troubleshooting Steps Experiencing slow internet speed? Turn off the router for 30 seconds or more and then restart it. More often than not, this troubleshooting step alone will fix the problem. You may also require a modem upgrade if you are using an old router. Sometimes your modem may not be capable of delivering full bandwidth. If the problem is with the Wi-Fi modem, then consider placing it in a central location. Additionally, you can consider adding more access points to distribute Wi-Fi more equitably to all the house members. Switch to LAN Wi-Fi can become unreliable if too many people are using it. So if you have an ethernet port, consider switching to LAN with the help of a cable. A wired connection will offer higher speeds and more stability.","

Recently, Microsoft launched its very own coronavirus tracking map that aggregates data from reputed organisations to show the live counts of coronavirus statistics from across the world. According to Microsoft, its COVID-19 map is based on the information provided by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). The same information is also visible on the map's about section. Users can access the Microsoft Bing's coronavirus tracking dashboard via computer or smartphone at bing.com/covid. What's special about Microsoft Bing's COVID-19 tracker At first look, Microsoft's coronavirus dashboard looks like the other trackers, but it is probably one of the simplest maps dedicated to tracking the COVID-19. It is built so light that you will feel no problem using it on your phone. The map shows the live statistics of the coronavirus cases from across the world. You can see the total confirmed cases of the disease, lives lost because of the virus, as well as the number of people who made a recovery. You can also click or tap on a specific location to see its individual statistics. The map also shows coronavirus related news stories-- a feature not present in other dashboards. We've seen a number of trackers built by reputed enterprises aggregating data from health organisations. The wide use of these COVID-19 tracking dashboards also caught cybercriminals' eyes, which resulted in a number of fake dashboards that exist to hack your computer and steal valuable information stored in your browser like credit card information and more. Coronavirus pandemic The Coronavirus pandemic has affected more than 1.5 lakh people worldwide, claiming more than 6,500 lives so far. China is the worst affected country from where the virus began spreading. Italy is the second most affected country, followed by Iran. The number of coronavirus cases in India has also risen to 114 that includes 17 foreign nationals. Maharashtra reported the highest number of cases, followed by Kerala.","

The virus that broke out last year in December has now infected over 90,000 people and claiming over 3,000 lives globally. The efforts to combat the deadly virus are carried out at an unprecedented pace and scientists claim that developing a vaccine for the virus can take some time. Governments in many countries have also shifted their focus toward the containment of the disease. Amid this vast chaos, a common man might himself to be of no help. However, researchers at Stanford group are asking your help to assist them in studying the virus. Stanford University's computing project, Folding@home is seeking volunteers that can donate computational power to help the researchers develop therapies for the novel coronavirus. Folding@home uses a program that allows the project to access the processing capacities of networked computers and use that power to simulate the complex unfolding process of proteins. Protein unfolding helps researchers to developer cures for various diseases including Alzheimer's, cancer, SARS and the current COVID-19 coronavirus. How can you help? On the official Folding@home website, you can find a brief description that explains how COVID-19 affects human beings. Here is an excerpt, ""For both coronaviruses [the current 2019 nCoV and SARS], the first step of infection occurs in the lungs, when a protein on the surface of the virus binds to a receptor protein on a lung cell. This viral protein is called the spike protein ... Proteins are not stagnant—they wiggle and fold and unfold to take on numerous shapes. We need to study not only one shape of the viral spike protein but all the ways the protein wiggles and folds into alternative shapes."" Scientists believe that studying how the protein folds can help them in developing drugs to treat the disease. However, this research requires a substantial amount of computing power and FAH generates that power through its volunteers' computers when it is idle. Earlier, FAH was using Sony PlayStation 3's CPU to generate computing power, however, Sony ended up removing the functionality for the PS3 in 2012. If you wish to become a volunteer at FAH, you can download the FAH program from Folding@home.","

378,2020-02-28,18:48:58,technology,internet,LinkedIn is considering Snapchat-like stories as it wants users to get creative," Up until we only knew LinkedIn as a website that is only reserved for professionals. The website helps individuals come in contact with employers, share resumes and land a job. At the same time, LinkedIn also serves a cool social media platform. It works similarly to Facebook where you can post statuses, connect with people and, of course, exchange messages. Now, the professional-social platform is considering to introduce Snapchat-like stories. LinkedIn says that it is currently testing this ""new conversational format"" for business conversations internally. LinkedIn's Head of Content, Pete Davies stated that these new conversational formats will allow for a more casual way of interacting while still being focused on business aspects of things. Davies also imagines that some companies can come up with more creative ways to share ""key moments from work events"" or ""tips and tricks that help us work smarter."" Third time's a charm In 2018, LinkedIn had a poor attempt at becoming more relevant to the social media trend of that time. The company introduced video filters, which did not age quite well as it did on other social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. So, one may look at these story features that LinkedIn is aiming at from the same cynical eyes. The story feature was originally introduced by Snapchat in 2013. It was soon adopted by Instagram and it became even more popular in 2016. Other popular social media platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp, and YouTube would also go ahead to shamelessly copy the idea. Well, this isn't the first time that LinkedIn dabbled with ""stories."" In 2018, the company introduced a feature called ""Student Voices,"" which allowed college students to post video content to a ""Campus Playlist."" Once the story was posted, it stayed on the top of all content in the news feed. The reason that Student Voices did not grow well was because of its limited scope and the audience that could use it. Moreover, this feature was also very limited it terms of features like Instagram offers. The new story feature, however, seems to offer a robust service. Since LinkedIn is testing the story feature internally, there isn't any guarantee if it actually launches the service to the public. Whenever it does, we'll make sure to let you know.","

In a statement given to Business Insider, Facebook confirmed that the company even has similar policies for its Marketplace platform that allows users to buy and sell items. According to The Verge, Facebook is trying its best to support the efforts of the World Health Organization by ""taking steps to stop ads for products that refer to the coronavirus and create a sense of urgency, like implying a limited supply or guaranteeing a cure or prevention. For example, ads with claims like face masks are 100% guaranteed to prevent the spread of the virus will not be allowed."" Facebook vs misinformation Earlier this month, the company also announced that it would be removing all misinformation from both Facebook and Instagram. In that announcement, the company stated that it is setting up policies against fake cure contents, prevention methods, and misleading health information. The recent policy update, however, is focused on combating those who use fearmongering tactics to sell products. Facebook seems to be having a similar stand against coronavirus misinformation and anti-vaccination content. Last year, the company claimed that it would be removing all anti-vaccine pages and groups from the platform, and as well as it wouldn't allow ads to target users based on anti-vaccine terms. However, some reports have suggested that despite this claim, several anti-vaccine ads have seemed to pop-up on the platform, to which Facebook replied that none of those ads violated the set policies. ""Our policy is to ban ads containing vaccine misinformation,"" Facebook stated to Buzzfeed News ""on the basis that it expresses opposition to vaccines."" The platform has been also constantly criticized for circulating fake political campaigns. Even though Facebook justified its approach to political speeches by stating, ""people should be able to hear from those who wish to lead them,"" most people believe that Facebook is a private company, shouldn't be policing political statements. On a side note, the company has also dropped out of several conferences as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.","

Google has you covered with a new feature that turns Search into a great teacher. We've turned to Google so many times for both simple and tough queries and rarely did the world's largest search engine has left us disappointed. Google Search played a teacher's role in our life after the digital transformation more often than we can remember. One of the most popular queries on Google Search has to be pronunciations and the web search giant has the perfect feature to make our lives easier. From Shashi Tharoor's Floccinaucinihilipilification to Donald Trump's covfefe, Google Search gave definitions, meanings and pronunciations to improve our knowledge base and vocabulary with a simple web search. So as long as you're connected to the internet, the door to knowledge can never shut, and it is one of the perks of being digitally enabled. Google is rolling out a new Search feature that will allow people to not just listen to the right pronunciations, but also pronounce it right by practising it with Google. There's a new addition in the search results when you look for pronunciations on Google that will allow you to practice the word till you get it right. ""Studies have shown that practicing how to say a word can be helpful for remembering it, especially when you're learning a new language. Previously, when you searched for things like ""how to pronounce quokka,"" you could play audio and hear the word. With the new pronunciation feature, you'll be able to also practice saying ""quokka"" into your phone's microphone and receive feedback on what, if anything, can be adjusted in your pronunciation,"" Google explained in a blog post on Thursday. Google is using speech recognition technology to separate words into soundbites. Then, with the help of machine learning, Google cross-references your pronunciation of a word with the actual pronunciation. If you get it right the first time, kudos! But if Google recognizes a mismatch, it will give feedback on how to improve and try again. Google's new feature is rolling out in American English and a Spanish version is expected to follow soon. Finally, Google is also adding images to Search results of word meanings, which help us remember better. Since adding images to all words is a lengthy process, Google is starting with nouns and later it will expand to other categories.","

382,2019-11-01,16:04:53,technology,internet,Going on a trip you wish no one finds out? Google Maps got you covered," Google is omnipresent with its products and services that help people in more ways than one can imagine. From a simple web search to getting from one place to another, Google's services have got you covered. Google Maps is by far the most accurate mapping software commercially available right now and Google has never stopped improving it. With new features, Google Maps keeps getting better. And now the world's most popular navigation app has received another useful feature that makes certain someone extremely happy. Google Maps has borrowed a page from Chrome browser in bringing one of its most popular features, Incognito Mode. Google announced that the rollout of Incognito mode for Maps has already begun and users will receive it in a few days if haven't already. There's no exact word on when iPhone users can expect the feature, but it only says ""coming soon."" Regardless, it's not a feature that you cannot go without so you're good until it arrives - at its own pace. For those who have received Incognito in Google Maps can simply activate it by opening the app, tapping the profile picture and selecting ""Turn on Incognito mode."" But the biggest question is why anyone would want to use Incognito Mode in Maps. Well, there are more than one reasons we could think of. For instance, if you're going on a road trip you wish on one finds out about, switching to Incognito mode while using Maps for navigation can save you the trouble of cleaning your search and browsing history. Incognito mode in Google Maps works just like it does in Chrome. By using Incognito mode in Google Maps, your phone won't save your browsing or search history or send notifications asking you to review the destination, update your location history or share location and use your activity to personalise Maps for future. But it is worth mentioning that Incognito mode in Maps doesn't stop your ISP, other apps, voice search and other Google services from tracking your secret trips.","

383,2019-10-12,16:02:45,technology,internet,Will Reliance Jio's 30-minute offer of free talk time calm upset customers?," Reliance Jio Infocomm's offer of 30-minute free talk time two days after slapping a 6-paise per minute charge on interconnect calls may not be enough to calm the upset customers. A large number of customers who switched to the young network when it opened shop about three years back expressed a sense of betrayal after the voice tariff was introduced. Jio's growth has so far hinged on the price advantage it offered, helping it to edge out Bharti Airtel as the second biggest telco in market share with 29 percent behind only Vodafone Idea. The company was expected to take over the top spot riding its offers of deep discount, but some market observers are sceptical that it may happen soon now. Jio has been sending messages to users' phones that customers will get free talk time of 30 minutes the first time they recharge their phones. However, the fact that this will be a one-time offer may put off the users. This is a handholding exercise to help a smooth transition for subscribers,"" a report on the Economic Times website said citing an unidentified source. Jio website carries a clarification on why the charge on inter-network calls that invite interconnect user charges (IUC). Jio's rivals Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea had swung into action to lure customers disgruntled with the Mukesh Ambani-owned telco's decision, the report says. The move had prompted sharp criticism on social media where #BoycottJio began trending after the announcement. Many users reminded Jio, which has estimated 350 million customers of its promise of free lifetime voice calls when it started providing services three years ago and threatened to dump the provider, the report says. Some memes showed clips of Mukesh Ambani's announcement that Jio will never charge for voice and the audience's reaction. The social media wars have since intensified with the hashtag #ILoveJio #JioUsers also beginning to trend. The Jio management's offer of free data on talk-time vouchers that will be of Rs 10, Rs 20, Rs 50 or Rs 100 denominations to make calls to customers of other networks have also not helped soothe customer anger. Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea have been taking potshots at their disruptive rival while assuring their own users of continuity of their free unlimited calls. The Sunil Mittal-led Bharti Airtel came out with the #AbToh-SahiChuno (choose right now) campaign as part of which it wrote, ""For some unlimited calls means something else. For us, unlimited calls have truly meant unlimited calls. Switch to Airtel now. ""Vodafone and Idea, in their respective Twitter posts, took a dig at Jio. Idea wrote, ""Free calls on unlimited recharges. We truly mean it."" Reliance Jio recently launched its JioFiber, which is expected to disrupt the broadband market as Jio did to mobile telephony. The free call and falling data charges have been thought to have an important part to play in the success of Prime Miniter Narendra Modi's Digital India initiative.  ","

384,2019-10-11,13:17:57,technology,internet,Is Jio's new charge on inter-network calls bid to kill two birds with one stone?," Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio's move to charge 6 paise extra on voice calls has taken the market and telecom experts by surprise, reports show. The telecom player - that garnered about 29 per cent market share in three years of launch to edge out Bharti Airtel earlier this year as the second-largest mobile service provider - surprised the markets by announcing the decision to pass on the interconnect usage charges (IUC) to its subscribers. Market analysts, who had expressed concern over the steady decline in the company's profitability over the past several months, are struggling to understand the implications of the decision, an Economic Times report said. The fair value computations for the companies of the sector have gone into a tailspin with the announcement. Jio had come into a cluttered telecom scene with an aggressive strategy that disrupted the sector and caused several smaller companies to close down. At a time when Jio is set to disrupt the broadband scene with its JioFiber entry, the analysts are trying to place the move on the company's strategic growth plan. The reports say they are trying to ascertain whether it is an indirect tariff increase, helping Jio to gradually enhance profitability. Some others believe the measure might be aimed at pressuring the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) to abolish IUC by its original deadline of December 2019. Jio was expected to gradually raise the tariff to improve the return on investments once it reached a market share of 45 per cent in the next two years, according to industry observers. The telecom venture already accounts for about a fourth of the total enterprise value of the parent Reliance Industries, the biggest Indian company by market value. Jio's market strategy has been driven by the traditional Indian weakness for price advantage by offering a reasonable discount on tariffs when compared with its peers. Once the tariff advantage vanishes in a market of extreme price sensitivity, the market expansion may plateau out, analysts believe. Some analysts believe subscribers may find it difficult to assess the benefits of a top-up voucher, and the effective bundled payments could narrow Jio's tariff differential with peers. The effective increase in tariffs after the introduction of top-up vouchers could restore parity with Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea on Jio's 84-day plan, the report suggests. Currently, Jio is considered 13 per cent less expensive than the peers and managing to maintain the value leadership despite profitability pressures. Financial analysts say the new top-up voucher could lift the average revenue per user (ARPU) for Jio by Rs 15-19. Some market analysts think that by announcing the hike, Jio would be angling for greater subscriber market share by highlighting its zero-IUC advantage on its own network. Jio is a net payer of IUC as 64 per cent calls are outgoing, while Bharti Airtel and Vodafone pay 45 per cent and 41 per cent, respectively. Jio is locked in a row with other telecom players over its decision to reduce the alert time (ring duration) for calls to other networks to first 20 seconds and later to 25, while the other networks demand to restore the 30-second ringer time. Jio, on the other hand, claims 20 seconds is the international norm. ","

President Donald Trump has not only banned world leader in 5G technology Huawei from the US but also threatened to sanction companies that sell or buy the technology. Though India has not yet decided on excluding Huawei, the telecom operators fear that a decision in the future could affect their plans for 5G rollout. Jio has tied up with South Korean telecom major Samsung, Airtel is in finalising agreements with European tech giants Ericsson and Nokia, a media report says. Only Jio and Airtel have sought the permission of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) for the trial run, a report on the Business Standard website says. Vodafone-Idea group is yet to decide on 5G because of the massive investments necessary and the high rates likely to be quoted at the 5G auctions. Telecommunications Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said soon after assuming office in May that the government would take a decision on Huawei soon. However, a decision has been delayed amid the US-China trade war. The dealy could adversely impact the Digital India push of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government in its second stint, considering the need for reliable fast internet connectivity. Experts say that India would struggle to meet the target of taking quality internet to the rural hinterland without the help of the cheaper technology available with the Chinese players. Huawei is among the six technology providers who have approached the government for inclusion in the 5G trials, Prasad told Parliament in June. Another Chinese vendor ZTE has also shown interest along with Samsung of South Korea, Ericsson of Sweden, and Nokia of Finland, a report in the Economic Times said. India has set up an expert panel on 5G security and the Chinese vendors would have to wait until the panel headed by the Principal Scientific Adviser to the government comes out with its recommendations. Though telcos have been pressing the government for an early decision on the matter because of the huge investment and long term commitments required the panel is yet to finalize its report to the government. Telcos fear that the government may not be able to withstand pressure from the US on Chinese tech companies whom it accuses of helping the government in Beijing to spy on US interests. The government is firming up plans to conduct the sale of airwaves debuting 5G spectrum this year itself. The government plans to allocate 5G trial spectrum for a year that will be extendable for a one-time fee of Rs 5,000 per location, reports say.  ","

There also won't be any installation charge, but a refundable security deposit of Rs 2,500 towards the JioFiber router will be levied. No cash payment will be accepted as Jio advises customers to pay using a credit card, debit card, JioMoney or PayTM. In case the customer chooses to discontinue the services after the free preview offer, the security deposit will be refunded to the account directly within 60 days from the date of cancellation request. Currently, there is no official word on the plans and prices of JioFiber, but it is expected to start at Rs 700 per month and go as high as Rs 10,000 a month.

387,2019-09-05,11:03:23,technology,internet,Google to pay $170 million penalty for violating child privacy on YouTube," Google, which is owned by Alphabet Inc, and its YouTube video service will pay $170 million to settle allegations that it broke federal law by collecting personal information about children, the Federal Trade Commission said on Wednesday. YouTube had been accused of tracking viewers of children's channels using cookies without parental consent and using those cookies to target million of dollars in advertisements to those viewers.The settlement with the FTC and the New York attorney general's office, which will receive $34 million, is the largest since a law banning collecting information about children under age 13 came into effect in 1998. The law was revised in 2013 to include ""cookies,"" used to track a person's internet viewing habits. It is also small compared with the company's revenues. Alphabet, which generates about 85% of its revenue from sales of ad space and ad technology, in July reported total second-quarter revenue of $38.9 billion. YouTube said in a statement on Wednesday that in four months it would begin treating all data collected from people watching children's content as if it came from a child. ""This means that we will limit data collection and use on videos made for kids only to what is needed to support the operation of the service,"" YouTube said on its blog. In addition to the monetary fine, the proposed settlement requires the company to create a system for identifying content aimed at children and to notify channel owners about their obligations to get consent from parents before collecting information on children. FTC Chairman Joe Simons noted at a news conference on Wednesday what he said were important changes to YouTube business practices. ""No other company in America is subject to these types of requirements and they will impose significant costs on YouTube,"" he told reporters. FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection director Andrew Smith told reporters that the $170 million settlement was based on revenues from data collected, times a multiplier. ""It happens that $170 million is roughly the budget of the Bureau of Consumer Protection for one year,"" he added. Once the settlement takes effect, the FTC plans to ""conduct a sweep of the YouTube platform to determine whether there remains child-directed content"" in which personal information is being collected, Smith said. The FTC could take actions against individual content creators or channel owners as a result. In late August, YouTube announced it would launch YouTube Kids with separate niches for children depending on their ages and designed to exclude disturbing videos. It has no behavioral advertising. YouTube allows companies to create channels, which include advertisements that create revenue for both the company and YouTube. In its complaint, the government said that YouTube touted its popularity with children in marketing itself to companies like Mattel and Hasbro. It told Mattel that ""YouTube is today's leader in reaching children age 6-11 against top TV channels,"" according to the complaint. New York Attorney General Letitia James said the companies ""abused their power."" ""Google and YouTube knowingly and illegally monitored, tracked, and served targeted ads to young children just to keep advertising dollars rolling in,"" said James. The two Democrats on the FTC, Rebecca Slaughter and Rohit Chopra, dissented from the settlement. Slaughter, who called the violations ""widespread and brazen,"" said the settlement fails to require YouTube to police channels that provide children's content but do not designate it as such, thus allowing more lucrative behavioral advertising, which relies on tracking viewers through cookies. Senators Ed Markey and Richard Blumenthal, both Democrats active in online privacy matters, criticized the settlement in separate statements. ""A financial settlement is no substitute for strict reforms that will stop Google and other tech companies from invading our privacy,"" Blumenthal said. ""I continue to be alarmed by Big Tech's policies and practices that invade children's lives.""","

With only one day to go for the big launch, a lot of questions about its connections, plans, offers and more are yet to be answered. But here's what we know to help you get started with JioFiber. Reliance JioFiber, like Airtel's V-Fiber and ACT Fibernet, will offer high-speed internet to homes and small businesses. There will be a wide range of plans and packages to suit the individual needs of customers. JioFiber plans will vary depending on the speed of the internet, which ranges from 100Mbps to 1Gbps, so will the prices. Let's take you through JioFiber essentials ahead of Sept. 5 launch. Plans and pricing Reliance Jio is yet to reveal the plans and prices of its JioFiber broadband, but the service is expected to cost Rs 700 a month for its basic connection offering 100Mbps speed and Rs 10,000 for the most premium package that gives 1Gbps speeds. There is no word on how much data will be offered to customers under each plan. Welcome offer Reliance Jio has spoiled Indians with its free 4G service for several months before it was officially launched. But JioFiber is a different case and there won't be several months of free service. However, Jio will keep up its reputation and likely offer its FTTH broadband service free for the first two months with a refundable deposit of Rs 2,500. As a part of its Welcome Offer, Reliance Jio is also expected to give away free HD or 4K TV depending on the package customers choose. If we have to guess, the HD TV will be given to those who opt for the basic packages and the 4K TV will be reserved for the top-tier 1Gbps plan. There's no guarantee on every customer being eligible for this free giveaway as it could be random or on a first-come, first-serve basis. Free 4K set-top-box, landline Reliance JioFiber is only the foundation for other services the company is planning to launch. It appears, JioFiber customers will get a free Jio 4K set-top-box, which supports gaming, video conferencing, integrated graphics card, VR content and more. In addition, customers will also get a fixed landline connection with attractive plans focused on international calling, which Jio guarantees to be the lowest fixed-line rates in the industry. Entertainment services Reliance Jio already offers a suite of Jio apps, which include entertainment apps like JioMusic and TV. With JioFiber, the company plans to offer free bundled subscriptions to popular OTT services. Although there's no word on which streaming services will be offered for free via JioFiber, we can expect anything from the existing bunch of Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hotstar and others. But don't settle for that. The company also revealed that its Premium subscribers will enjoy extra benefits, including its recently-launched First-Day-First-Show movies from the comfort of home. The service is not ready yet and could launch by mid-2020, but expect some details on the same on Thursday. Registrations Reliance JioFiber registrations have been open for a while now, ever since the company started testing its service in select cities. The company has already received over 15 million registrations from 1,600 towns across India. If you haven't registered yet, head over to the official JioFiber website and register with your address. Depending on the demand from a particular area, Reliance Jio will roll out its service accordingly.","

Airtel Airtel is offering additional data on three of its V-Fiber broadband plans. The Basic plan priced at Rs 799 will offer 200GB extra data on top of the 100GB high-speed data at 40Mbps speed. Secondly, the Entertainment plan that costs Rs 1,099 per month will get 500GB additional data on top of their 300GB limit with 100Mpbs speeds. Finally, the Premium plan subscribers get the maximum benefit of 1,000GB additional data at the same monthly rental of Rs 1,599. The subscribers already get 600GB data with up to 300Mbps speeds alongside unlimited local and STD calls, 1 year free Amazon Prime subscription, three months Netflix subscription, Zee5 Premium subscription and Airtel TV Premium for free. The subscriptions to OTT services are free for Entertainment plan subscribers as well, but the basic plan customers only get unlimited calls and Airtel TV Premium subscription. Tata Sky Broadband Tata Sky broadband is offering a smart deal to make sure its customers don't leave for Jio GigaFiber when it launches. The service provider is offering extra validity on its annual plans, but it varies depending on the cities. It currently offers service in 21 cities across India. In cities like Bengaluru, Chennai, Pimpri Chinchwad, and Pune, customers get 3 months extra validity for the price of 12 months. Similarly, customers in Hyderabad will get 6 months extra validity and those in Jodhpur will enjoy 12 months of additional validity on choosing 18-month plan. The speeds vary depending on your choice, 10Mbps, 40Mbps, 75Mbps or 100Mbps. So what's it going to be?

After disruptive the telecom space with its nationwide 4G rollout, affordable plans and more, Reliance Jio is now stepping into the fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) broadband space with its Jio GigaFiber. At RIL's 42nd annual general meeting (AGM), Mukesh Ambani announced that it will commence the Jio GigaFiber rollout in India on September 5 - which marks the company's third-year anniversary. The Jio GigaFiber plans start at Rs 700 per month and go all the way up to Rs 10,000 per month depending on the speed users choose. Reliance Jio, which offered free 4G services for several months before official rollout, is now attracting consumers with something new. Jio GigaFiber subscribers will get a free HD or 4K LED TV for free as a part of the ""Welcome Offer"" on the condition that they opt for the annual plans aka Jio-Forever plans. There's no clarity on how Reliance Jio will choose its customers to give away free HD or 4K TV, but it appears the 4K resolution televisions will be reserved for the premium tier and the HD TVs will be given to those who get the basic package. Reliance Jio's GigaFiber plans start at Rs 700 for the 100Mbps plan and the top-tier package will offer 1Gbps speeds. With only a few more days to go for the official rollout, it's worth noting that interested folks register themselves on the company's official JioFiber broadband website. The individual plans and prices, depending on the data allocation, will be revealed on September 5. Keep a close watch on the offers bundled with each plan to get the maximum benefits. In addition to the LED TVs, Reliance Jio will also be offering a free 4K set-top-box and a free landline. After all, the company is going for a bundled service and not just broadband, so it makes sense to give the best package at launch. There will be attractive calling plans focused on international calls, where Jio guarantees lowest fixed-line rates. Finally, the free offerings don't just end there. Reliance Jio GigaFiber subscribers will also get free access to some premium OTT services. It is not clear what these are, but we are hoping to see something on the lines of Amazon, Netflix, Hotstar. If nothing, Jio's own JioTV, JioMovies will be a part of the package.","

391,2019-07-30,18:05:05,technology,internet,Jio GigaFiber effect: ACT Fibernet offers 6 months free internet - there's a catch," Rumours are Jio GigaFiber rollout is picking up the pace, triggering panic among incumbents who are willing to demonstrate generosity in a bid to win customers. Reliance Jio is expected to launch its 1Gbps FTTH broadband service across India as early as next month, which means users will finally be able to get affordable rates for high-speed internet at home. ACT Fibernet is one of the most fierce and disruptive broadband service providers in India. The company offers affordable plans and has several special bundles to lure customers. While it remains to be seen if ACT will have the same appeal after the Jio GigaFiber launch, but the current offers at hand surely make a compelling argument. If you're looking for a long-term broadband plan, ACT Fibernet has just the right one for you and with a great offer. The service provider is offering up to 6 months free internet with select plans in its current portfolio. ACT Fibernet's best broadband offer gives 6 months of high-speed internet for free. But the condition is that customers opt for a 12-month subscription. Depending on the region, the advance subscription could be 18 months to avail 6 months free internet. Customers are advised to verify the plans by choosing the right city. In Bengaluru, ACT is offering 6 months free internet for subscribing to ACT GIGA for 12 months. The monthly subscription for ACT GIGA is Rs 5,999, but in all fairness, the plan gives 1Gbps internet speed with 2500GB data and 1Mbps post FUP speed. Similarly, in Hyderabad, customers get 6 months free internet with an 18-month advance rental on A-Max 675, A-Max 1050, A-Max 1299 and Incredible 1999 plans. Sadly, the 6-month free internet offer is not available in Delhi. ACT Fibernet's 6-month free internet offer might be limited to certain cities, it has other offers like one-month free internet extra data and a free router for most cities. For instance, customers in Bengaluru can get 1 or 2-month free internet with 6 or 12-month subscription. Customers who are not willing to commit for a longer period can avail a minimum of 15 days extension with 5.5-month advance rental, but this plan is only available in Hyderabad. Customers can go through all the available offers by ACT Fibernet before they renew or purchase a new connection. Make sure you choose your city from a dropdown menu on the top right corner before selecting the offer.","

Jio GigaFiber is expected to disrupt the broadband industry in the same way it disrupted the Indian mobile industry. With 100Mbps broadband speeds and affordable plans, Reliance Jio could easily become the front-runner amidst stiff competition from Airtel, ACT Fibernet and others. There have been several reports in the past hinting about the potential plans and prices of Jio GigaFiber. With the Annual General Meeting (AGM) just around the corner, Reliance Jio is highly expected to end the mystery around the pricing and plans of Jio GigaFiber. But before that, there's a word on the street that Jio's FTTH broadband plans could start as low as Rs 600 per month. According to the latest reports, Jio GigaFiber's Rs 600 monthly plan would offer consumers 50Mbps speeds whereas the blazing-fast 100Mbps plan would come at Rs 1,000 a month. The latest information about Jio GigaFiber plans follows a similar report in April, which had hinted similar pricing for the new broadband service in India. Live Mint had reported at the time that Jio would offer broadband, TV subscription and landline service at Rs 600 per month. At this price point, Airtel and ACT Fibernet would definitely feel the heat. The report also added that Reliance Jio plans to offer 100GB free data with 100Mbps speed as a part of its preview offer. Reliance Jio has already been testing its high-speed fibre-optic broadband in select regions. Consumers willing to test out the new service had to pay Rs 4,500 towards a deposit, post which Jio has offered 100Mbps broadband and 100GB data for free. These test runs are currently being conducted in Delhi, Mumbai, Ahmedabad and other cities. Interested folks can register for Jio GigaFiber from the company's official website.

When launched, Jio GigaFiber will be the largest Greenfield fixed-line broadband rollout with a real-time introduction in 1,100 cities across India.","

395,2019-06-22,10:49:21,technology,internet,Milan Kordestani gives this piece of advice to new startup founders," Startup founders are the risk takers, the ones who aren't afraid of failure in the pursuit of reaching their dreams. Creating something new needs attention to detail, good knowledge of the subject and determination to make it stand out, apart from various other factors. Independent record label Guin Records made it big with the release of their debut album Uncharted. The album consists of various hip-hop artists and also consists of their individual tracks. The vibe of the album is completely different from others. The label has got the ability to give artists a unique platform on a large scale. This also proves that the founders of Guin records, the Kordestani siblings definitely like to think outside the box. Milan Kordestani (19) and Misha Kordestani (21) of Guin Records are amongst the youngest record label executives in America. Not many people are acquainted with the fact that the origin of Guin Records happened inside Milan Kordestani's college dorm room. As a young entrepreneur, Milan is excited to create and be a part of growing industries at a young age, bringing new perspectives to the table. Both Milan and Misha are well aware of the history of hip-hop and also with the kind of impact their label works to create. However, their journey as the proud business owners has not been an easy ride. Being young and inside the business comes with its own challenges. However, when it comes to creating a successful label, Milan and Misha have done everything right, bringing in as many experienced industry personnel that they can, to ensure the label's success. From coming up with the ethos for an independent record label, Milan's journey to create this label has been a rollercoaster ride. In the initial days, Milan approached various SoundCloud and YouTube rappers and asked them about their interest in being a part of the Uncharted album. While Misha kept advising him on various matters, things started solidifying, and they quickly became the duo they are known as today. Their joint efforts and out of the box approach started turning heads and bringing in interest from industry heads who wanted to collaborate to bring the mission of Guin to life. Since then, the Kordestani siblings have collaborated with many artists creating cultural impacts in their communities. Their major focus has been on creating music that is impactful. Both Milan and Misha are excited about working with influential artists in the future and making Guin Records a large entity. Milan keeps a strong opinion about the impact of technology on music. He believes that as various streaming platforms have given budding artists their own space and sales, their fandom still remains flickering. While the streaming platforms offer quite less to the artists, they help bring their music to a world panorama. With more playlists and streaming platforms, there is a reduction in album sales. This also brings in the uncertainty about what the future of technology will bring for the artists. Milan believes that artists shape our culture and they should be getting the rewards of the hard work they deserve. Milan Kordestani has got a piece of valuable advice for the coming of age entrepreneurs. He believes that one, especially when new to an industry, should never stop asking questions and learning. He states that ""Continuing to be a student in all aspects of my life allows me to improve myself and the work I do daily. I think the moment someone thinks they know everything, they enter a state of ignorance, or they become 'dated' within their field.""","

396,2019-06-03,18:43:44,technology,internet,Digital India gets a boost as government sets 100-day horizon for 5G trials," The long wait of Indian customers for 5G telecommunication services could be over soon as Modi 2.0 is keen on fast-tracking their introduction in the country. Upgrading of India's telecommunication infrastructure to the next level is vital for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Digital India programme in his second stint, according to officials. The 5G technology is important for achieving the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) objective of digital inclusion, which is the pivot of the Digital India programme, according to Telecommunication Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, who retained his portfolio from the last government. The 5G technology can ensure must faster data connections with download speeds reportedly hitting 1 gigabit per second when 4G's highest speed just about tops 1 megabit per second. All major telecom players including Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio, Airtel and Vodafone Idea are reportedly getting ready to join the 5G bandwagon. A single 5G antenna can reportedly support about 1 million users whereas a 4G antenna can hook up a maximum of 100,000 devices. Prasad is also pushing for the spectrum auction to take place this year. The last auction of the spectrum had happened in 2016, reports say.  The government will also set up one lakh digital villages and also look to expedite domestic manufacturing of telecom equipment under Prime Minister Modi's Make in India programme, said Prasad, who is also in charge of the information technology ministry. ""Five lakh wifi hotspots will be established on a priority basis. We will ensure that the hotspots reach areas that need digital inclusion,"" a report in Mint quoted Prasad as saying. Trials of the 5G services will begin in the next 100 days, reports cited Prasad as saying after assuming charge on Monday. Prasad has in the past laid stress on extending quality telecom infrastructure into the rural areas. Digital inclusion means taking the benefits of the digital revolution that India is witnessing to the rural parts of the country. The 5G services will be used to bring vital services to the deprived sectors and for social causes, Prasad said. Major 5G equipment producers including Huawei, Nokia, Samsung, and Ericsson are expected to take part in the trials. South Korea has pioneered the 5G technology's commercial use by introducing it in substantial areas from April 2019. South Korea's SK Telecom has 38,000 base stations, KT Corporation 30,000 and LG U Plus 18,000. About 85 per cent of the stations is deployed in six major cities including capital Seoul. The country has a target of luring 10 per cent of users to 5G by the end of the year. China is about to launch 5G in a big way and aims at having 40 per cent of all 5G users in the world by 2025. Japan plans to make a big splash with an extensive 5 G network by the 2020 Olympics. The US has a limited number of base stations in the cities of Chicago and Minneapolis. The UK has introduced services in some areas on an experimental basis.","

YouTube Premium and YouTube Music were launched two months ago, allowing users to enjoy extra benefits of the existing services. YouTube's subscription model is on point, but users have gotten comfortable with the free offering, so convincing them to convert into paying users is proving to be quite a task. In a bid to lure young users, YouTube introduced cheaper plans for both its premium subscriptions that save nearly half of what users would normally pay. YouTube Premium costs Rs 129 a month while YouTube Music subscription costs Rs 99 per month. But if you're a student, YouTube Premium fee would drastically come down to Rs 59 while the YouTube Music subscription would cost Rs 79 per month. Why go premium? As in the case of all premium services, YouTube premium subscriptions offer some extra perks. YouTube Music subscribers can enjoy ad-free music streaming, background playback and even be able to download content. If you opt for YouTube Premium, all the benefits of YouTube Music will be carried over in addition to exclusive access to YouTube Originals. How to avail student subscriptions? YouTube's student plans are available only to full-time students from accredited colleges and universities in India. All students plans are available for purchase from YouTube's dedicated premium services page for both Music and Premium services. Students availing YouTube's discounted offer must furnish necessary academic details while signing up, the eligibility of which will be determined by SheerID. YouTube also notes that annual verification is required for students. For non-students If you're not a student and still looking for some deals on YouTube Premium, there's a two-month free trial for individuals and one month of free access to a family subscription. YouTube Music Premium Family plan gives access to up to 6 members and costs Rs 149 per month for Android users and Rs 199 per month for iOS users. Similarly, YouTube Premium Family plan costs Rs 189 for Android and Rs 249 for iOS users monthly.","

Khayyam was born in Nishapur (then a major centre of Zoroastrians) in Iran during the medieval times on 18 May 1048, under the Seljuq dynasty. His father was a Zoroastrian who had converted to Islam. According to the sources, Khayyam's full name was Abu'l Fath Omar ibn Ibrahim al-Khayyam. He was born into a family of tent-makers, which in Arab means Khayyam. He is widely recognised for his astronomical expertise and his poetry. With his astronomical proficiency, he designed the Jalali calendar, a solar calendar with a very precise 33-year intercalation cycle, which later became the base for many other calendars and was used until the 20th century. Even though he became famous for his poems posthumously, Khayyam's poems are celebrated by the people worldwide. It is written in four lines and is published in 'The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam'. As a mathematician, Khayyam is known for his work on the classification and solution of cubic equations. He was the first to give a general method for solving cubic equations. Khayyam also contributed to the understanding of the parallel axiom and at the age of 22, he had already created a name for himself within the field of mathematics. He furthermore wrote a treatise on extracting binomial theorem and the nth root of natural numbers, which has been lost. He died at the age of 83 on December 4, 1131, and was buried in the Khayyam Garden at Nishapur.","

Samsung Galaxy S10 is 'real' 5G compatible device unlike Moto Z3, which needs to attach a mod to get 5G service. As the sale started, Twitter users started showing off the speed of the 5G network. Some journalists posted speed test results on Twitter, which show more than a gigabyte of download speed. George L. Koroneos, a Verizon representative, posted a video, which shows 1,098 Mbps downloading speed with 27-ms ping. George stated in his tweet, ""This is 5G on the brand-new Samsung Galaxy S10 5G in front of my hotel. It's crazy the difference a month makes. #FirstToRealTime"" This is 5G on the brand new Samsung Galaxy S10 5G in front of my hotel. It's crazy the difference a month makes. #FirstToRealTime pic.twitter.com/Syxc7HGrqn Jessica Dolcourt, a CNET reporter, also posted an image with Samsung Galaxy S10 which hit 1,341.15 Mbps download speed. She said, ""Hot damn, this is like a whole different 5G network #Verizon #GalaxyS105G #SpeedTest."" To put things into perspective, Julian Chokkattu from Digital Trends said that It took 26 seconds to download PUBG: Mobile (a 1.86GB~ file) on the S10 5G while it took 2 minutes and 1 second at the 4G network.  He also downloaded a whole season of Sneaky Pete from Amazon Prime Video in 93 seconds on the S10 5G. It's worth pointing out, Verizon's 5G network currently covers only two cities in US – Chicago and Minneapolis. 5G will complement 4G We all know that the 5G network is knocking our doors, which means 'Will 4G network disappear soon like 3G or 2G?' the answer is ""No."" There are a few approaches carriers are using to roll out 5G, but millimetre wave (Ultra-Wideband) is a most common approach that is used by carriers (Verizon and AT&T), which gives super-fast speeds and low latency, but it has poor penetration and low rang. Millimetre wave has trouble going through buildings, blocks, and cars. So, if your locality is receiving 5G network coverage, there might be a chance that you could not get good 5G network in your building. That's why I think, 4G LTE is not going anywhere anytime soon. 5G is meant to complement it for the next couple of years. Currently, the 5G network is still in its infancy and some mobile manufacturers have started to unveil 5G compatible phones. But it is said that India might get the 5G network sometime in 2021.","

400,2019-05-16,17:50:24,technology,internet,Wikipedia blocked in China: Government restricts access to free online encyclopaedia in all languages," China has extended the ban on Wikipedia form the Chinese language to all language. Now, Wikipedia is no more accessible in any language in China. According to a report published by Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI), China started blocking Wikipedia for all languages sometime in April. The Chinese government had already blocked Wikipedia for the Chinese language since 2015. However, Wikimedia Foundation told AFP that it hadn't received any notices regarding the block. The reason behind this block is ill-defined, but the ban comes just weeks before the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests, which culminated in a violent government crackdown. China has blocked the particular web pages referencing the tragedy and the Himalayan region of Tibet, but it is impossible to block particular webpages of Wikipedia, as the site switched to HTTPS. So, a blanket ban would be the only way to preclude people from reading articles, especially since translation is readily available. The Chinese government hasn't been shy about cutting down internet access to people. Earlier this year, one man spent 15 days in a detention centre for posting a tweet, which was about criticising the government. The ban on Wikipedia could be more painful for Chinese people, especially for non-residents, as it cuts off access to a wealth of knowledge. Apart from China, the free community-edited encyclopaedia site was blocked in Turkey and it has been blocked intermittently in Venezuela this year.","

Everybody wants to hide their web habits, app usage, and location data. But Google aims to make its product helpful to the users. And for that, Google needs to know about your web habits and the location where you love to go. So, if you concern about your privacy and also want a helpful Android, then you just have to need to delete your activity manually. This is a very painful and time-consuming task. That changes now. In an official blog post from Google, the internet search titan is talking about a new privacy feature that all the users are going to love. After receiving feedbacks, Google is going to launch a new privacy feature that will help you to auto-delete your location and web activities. Google has confirmed the feature will roll out in the coming weeks. Currently, you just have a feature to control off/on your location and activity history and users can delete your history manually. Google's new auto-delete feature works on a timed system, and users can set the time duration to delete the data. You have two options: 3 months or 18 months. Google will automatically delete your location and activity from your account after the selected time duration. It's certainly a positive step for Google towards privacy. The blog post also hints that the feature will also come soon to other aspects of your Google experience, but it's coming first to location history and your web and app activity. Prior to this, an AP investigation revealed that Google was still steering and storing the location history of users who had turn off the history and search giant used this data for target Ads. This month is very important for the Google as I/O annual conference is going to commence on May 7 and Google is going to launch its budget Pixel 3a and 3a XL devices in the conference.

403,2019-03-26,15:04:30,technology,internet,"Special Event March 2019 highlights: Apple TV+, Arcade, News+ and Apple Card announced"," American technology major Apple hosted the Special Event Spring 2019 at the prestigious Steve Jobs Theater announcing several value-added services to not just people owning Apple devices, but also other brands. Apple Event March 2019: Highlights After watching the two hour Apple Spring event 2019, I finally get it why the company unveiled all the hardware products a week before the D-Day. Apple wanted this to be all about the services and boy, it had a lot of announcements; with big Hollywood celebrities on stage describing their shows coming to the brand new Apple TV+ service, made it even larger. Let's get started... Apple Card Apple Pay, which has become a ubiquitous transaction method in several developed markets, will now be paired with the Mastercard-powered Apple Card. It will be available as an app similar to Apple Wallet and also in physical titanium card. Consumers can register for Apple Card and get going in just a few minutes. ""Apple Card transforms the entire credit card experience by simplifying the application process, eliminating fees, encouraging customers to pay less interest and providing a new level of privacy and security,"" the company says. A notable aspect of Apple Card is the reward system; It is clearer and more compelling rewards program than other credit cards with Daily Cash, which gives back a percentage of every purchase as cash on customers' Apple Cash card each day. For instance, if you make a purchase on any third-party store, you stand to get 2% cashback and in Apple Store, you are entitled to get back 3% of the purchase amount. And, if you happen own physical Apple Card, then you can claim 1% cash back. It can be noted that the cashback will be instantly credited to the customers soon after the completion of the transaction. Another interesting aspect of the Apple Card is that there will be no service fees be it annual maintenance, international transaction, no penalty on late payment or over-the-limit fees. ""To help customers make informed choices, Apple Card shows a range of payment options and calculates the interest cost on different payment amounts in real time. As a way to pay less interest, Apple Card will also suggest paying a bit more every month and offers the flexibility to schedule more frequent payments."" For the Apple Card, the Cupertino-based company is partnering with Goldman Sachs and Mastercard to provide the support of an issuing bank and global payments network. ""Goldman Sachs is creating a different credit card experience centred around the customer, which includes never sharing or selling data to third parties for marketing and advertising. Mastercard will provide cardholders with the ability to shop at merchants around the globe,"" Apple noted. Apple Arcade Apple's App Store is already a home to more than 300,000 paid and free games, but with the new Arcade game subscription service, the user will have exclusive access to over 100 new games, including original releases from renowned creators Hironobu Sakaguchi, Ken Wong, Will Wright, Annapurna Interactive, Bossa Studios, Cartoon Network, Finji, Giant Squid, Klei Entertainment, Konami, LEGO, Mistwalker Corporation, SEGA, Snowman, ustwo games and dozens more. What's more interesting is that the gamers need not have to make any in-app purchases on Arcade subscription. All games are curated based on originality, quality, creativity, fun and their appeal to players of all ages. It will give customers the freedom to try any game from its handpicked collection of titles that are all-you-can-play, have no ads, ad tracking or additional purchases, and respect user privacy. Apple News+ Prior to the announcement, Apple News was available only in the US and now in its new avatar—'Apple News+'-- the company will expand its service to Canada and to the UK, Australia later in the year. With this, customers get access to world's top magazine subscriptions such as The Atlantic, Better Homes & Gardens, Bon Appétit, Condé Nast Traveler, ELLE, Entertainment Weekly, ESPN The Magazine, Esquire, Food & Wine, Good Housekeeping, GQ, Health, InStyle, Martha Stewart Living, National Geographic, New York Magazine, The New Yorker, O, The Oprah Magazine, Parents, People, Real Simple, Rolling Stone, Runner's World, Sports Illustrated, TIME, Travel + Leisure, Vanity Fair, Vogue, WIRED and Woman's Day. Besides them, Apple New+ most importantly give you access to leading newspapers which uphold journalist ethics high and doesn't stoop to click bait headlines. You will be able to read The Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times and Toronto Star, Canada's largest daily newspaper. Apple News+ also provides access to premium online publications such as theSkimm, The Highlight by Vox, New York Magazine's sites Vulture, The Cut and Grub Street, and Extra Crunch from Verizon Media's TechCrunch on all of your Apple devices and even your family too, get access to them. Currently, Apple News+ offers a little 300 newspapers and magazines in digital, which may cost you more than $8000 per year if you subscribe individually, but with the former, you have to pay just $9.99 per month in the US and $12.99 in Canada. Apple TV+ The main highlight of the Apple Event was the Apple TV+. The Cupertino-based company has roped in Hollywood's biggest artists, directors and personalities including Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg, Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, Octavia Spencer, J.J. Abrams, Jason Momoa, M. Night Shyamalan, Jon M. Chu and more for creating contents for Apple TV+ services. Personally, I feel Apple TV+ has a long way to catch up with the leaders Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, among other rivals, but going by the talents Apple has been successfully signed in for the TV+ is really promising. In the event, we were shown a glimpse of what in store for fans when the Apple TV+ finally goes live in the fall this year. Spielberg has confirmed to be making short movies on his childhood favourite Amazing Stories anthology, while Abrams is doing Little Voice TV series, Also, Reese Witherspoon will be acting beside Jennifer Aniston and Steve Caroll in The Morning Show and the big star Winfrey Oprah will be bringing multi-part documentaries on important global issues such as workplace harassment and mental health (depression). Apple says that these are just a few, there are several others in the pipeline will all go live subsequently later in the year and plans to add new TV shows every month starting this fall. The company has not announced the tariff of the subscription just ye and it looks like, we have to wait a few months to know. Besides the TV+, Apple also launched the all-new Apple TV app and Apple TV channels coming in May 2019. The all-new Apple TV app offers new shows, movies, sports, news and more in one app across iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Mac, smart TVs and streaming devices. Users can subscribe to and watch new Apple TV channels — paying for only services they want, like HBO, SHOWTIME and Starz — all on demand, available on and offline, with incredible picture quality and sound; consumers can enjoy sports, news and network TV from cable and satellite providers as well as purchase or rent iTunes movies and TV shows all within the new, personalized Apple TV app. Beginning in May, customers can subscribe to Apple TV channels à la carte and watch them in the Apple TV app, with no additional apps, accounts or passwords required. Apple TV channels include popular services such as HBO, Starz, SHOWTIME, CBS All Access, Smithsonian Channel, EPIX, Tastemade, Noggin and new services like MTV Hits, with more to be added over time around the world.","

404,2019-02-24,13:52:30,technology,internet,E-commerce policy: Chinese firms on crosshairs; stress on local data storage," A draft report on regulating e-commerce in the country flags Chinese e-commerce for their apparent security risk to the sector that is expected to grow to $200 billion by 2026 and the need to regulate them. The report prepared by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) lays stress on local storage for protection of consumer data and proposes to grant the industry a three-year window for enforcing that shift. However, the report rules out the need for an authority like the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) to regulate the industry, which was valued at $38.5 billion in 2017 (This estimate excludes travel and tourism business and business-to-business (B2B) commerce). Instead, the draft released for discussion among all stakeholders, recognizes a standing group of government secretaries as the primary industry regulatory body, unlike a body of technocrats like Trai. However, the report accepts the need for dedicated technology wings that would work with the regulators in view of the extreme specializations like artificial intelligence (AI), big data and deep learning that the e-commerce industry employs. ''This would help them understand and analyze transactions in a proper light,"" the draft says. The draft policy wants the government to be able to access source code and algorithms of AI-based systems.""There is a need to strike a balance between commercial interests and consumer protection issues, as well as issues of larger public concern, like preventing racial profiling and maintaining constitutionally mandated rights, such as the right to equality,"" the document says. Sources say the 41-page policy document is soft on companies like Amazon and Walmart, which owns Flipkart, perhaps considering the recent harsh policy changes that have hit them adversely. ""Data of companies like Amazon and Walmart are stored in India and they will not require many changes,"" an industry source said. ""Most of the what the draft talks about are under different stages of implementation,"" he said, according to a media report. With a tagline 'India's data for India's development', the report focuses particularly on the use of targeted marketing using AI to track consumer behaviour. The report seeks to regulate the use of AI bots that gather information on the frequency of website visits to search results to the time a user spends on a webpage. ''By tracking the search and browsing histories, online retail websites are able to target consumers with tailor-made marketing content,"" according to the draft report. ""Among the most prominent features of the draft e-commerce policy is its emphasis on data protection, including data collected by users in India and restrictions on sharing of such data, even if it is stored outside the country, even if a customer consents to such data storage,"" Atul Pandey, partner at Khaitan & Co, told the Business Standard website. ""It remains to be seen as to how the stringent EU General Data Protection Regulation interplays with such strict conditions on data sharing provided in the draft e-commerce policy."" The draft also proposes to regulate advertising charges on e-commerce websites. It specifically mentions small enterprises and start-ups for protection from the high tariff. ","

405,2019-02-12,18:58:50,technology,internet,When is Jio GigaFiber 100Mbps FTTH broadband rolling out after all? Disappointment looms," The anticipation for Reliance Jio's 100Mbps FTTH broadband, Jio GigaFiber, continues to grow among subscribers, but there's no word on when exactly the high-speed internet service will arrive for everyone. Reliance Jio has been testing Jio GigaFiber with a limited number of users in select cities for almost a year now, and it now appears the testing could go on longer.  Jio GigaFiber broadband rollout was initially expected to happen around Diwali last year, but that never happened citing some connectivity issues. Later, the commercial rollout was expected to begin in March this year, but it appears those reports might also not be true. According to the latest reports, Jio GigaFiber might be experiencing some issues that may result in further delay of a formal launch. The company had planned to go live with 1,100 towns in the first phase of GigaFiber's commercial rollout, but there seems to be some problem with last mile connectivity to small towns contributing towards the delay. The reports suggest Reliance Jio is currently at a phase called ""Area Ready for Sale"" rollout, where Jio executives reach out to Multiple Dwelling Unit (MDU) like high-rise societies with a proposal to try out Jio GigaFiber and then approach Single Dwelling Unit (SDU) like individual homes with the service. At this pace, customers waiting for Jio GigaFiber still have a couple of months at hand before the commercial rollout commences. The best guess is that the company will make the big announcement at its 42nd Annual General Meeting (AGM) in July this year. Based on what we know so far about Jio GigaFiber, it is expected to bring disruption to the broadband space as the company did in the telecom market. Early adopters of the service are being offered free service for 90 days, which gives them 1,110GB data per month with up to 100Mbps speed. The test run of Jio GigaFiber is currently limited to Delhi, Mumbai, and Ahmedabad and more cities are likely to be added soon. Early testers of Jio GigaFiber must pay Rs 4,500 refundable deposit towards installation and device costs. If the users choose to discontinue the service after the preview offer has ended, the full amount will be refunded. Reliance Jio is also tight-lipped about the price plans, which some reports suggest could start as low as Rs 500 a month for 300GB data at 50Mbps speed. The next tier will be Rs 750 a month for 450GB data at 50Mbps speeds. The telco will also offer two mid-level plans at Rs 999 and Rs 1,299, which will give 600GB and 750GB of data at 100Mbps, respectively. The top-end package will come at Rs 1,500 that will give 900GB at maximum speed. We are already seeing incumbents adjust their plans to prepare for the Jio GigaFiber's arrival. It will be interesting to see how the broadband market will transform when Jio officially hits the market. ","

406,2019-02-04,19:19:38,technology,internet,Can't get Jio GigaFiber yet? BSNL has an offer you cannot refuse," Reliance Jio's GigaFiber high-speed FTTH broadband still hasn't been rolled out commercially, leaving several Indians in anticipation of the disruptive service. The company, which is credited with bringing the much-needed change to the telecom sector, is expected to bring the same level of disruption to the home broadband market, making Jio GigaFiber one of the most anticipated launches this year. While thousands of Indians eagerly wait for Jio GigaFiber's release, incumbents are fearful of how to prevent another telecom-debacle, which resulted in rivals losing millions of users to Reliance Jio. As a result, we've seen Airtel, ACT Fibernet and even BSNL revisit their broadband plans and packages to offer better value to users and a new plan from the state-run provider, BSNL, is targeting data hoggers of the country. BSNL's Bharat Fiber programme, which was introduced a few days ago to rival Jio GigaFiber, welcomed a new offer that users cannot refuse. BSNL is offering 40GB daily data limit at 100Mbps speeds for a whole month at an attractive price point of Rs 2,499. If the user exhausts the 40GB limit in a day, the speed will be throttled to 2Mbps under fair usage policy. In addition to that, BSNL is running an offer to those who choose this plan for a period of 6 or 12 months. There is a 25 percent cashback scheme on the new broadband plan and it is valid only till February 28. If the customer choose to pay for 6 months, the total cashback will be around Rs 3,700 and for 12 months, the savings will be Rs 7,400. This is quite a deal for those who want a long-term broadband plan and a good way for BSNL to keep its users on the network without losing to rivals. Both the daily data limits and attractive price plans are compelling enough reasons for you to upgrade, but make sure your usage is as high as 40GB to make this plan worthwhile. Some plans come with 40GB monthly data limit and the fact that BSNL is offering it every day for 30 days means it is for serious data hoggers. Meanwhile, Reliance Jio is also on the brisk of rolling out its GigaFiber service across India. Reports put the commercial launch of Jio GigaFiber somewhere in March, so if you are planning to switch from BSNL to Jio in the future, the long-term plan, as benefitting as it may be, might not be such a good idea. ","

407,2019-02-01,16:14:06,technology,internet,Is Spotify coming to India or not? Everything you need to know," Spotify was widely expected to be launched in India on January 31, with hundreds of users eagerly waiting for the arrival of one of the most popular music streaming services in the world. But the due date of the impending launch passed and there was no word from Spotify on plans to launch its service in India, disappointing many in the process. If you've been one of those waiting to use Spotify in India without the help of VPN services and wondering what went wrong, here are some probable factors. But it must be noted that Spotify is indeed coming to India, it's just that the official launch date hasn't been finalised yet. If the latest reports are to be believed, Spotify is considering its debut in India sometime in March. But the same sources infer that nothing is concrete as of now. While potential subscribers await Spotify's release in India, here's everything you need to know – from reasons behind the delay, expected pricing and launch offers. Why did Spotify miss Jan. 31 launch date for India? Firstly, Spotify never publicly announced that it will be launching its service in India on January 31. The launch date was revealed by informed sources, which aren't 100 percent accurate all the time. Spotify might have had plans but seeing some challenges the service faces in India, it seems wise to delay the much-awaited launch. Spotify has signed a deal with renowned Indian label, T-Series, which has the world's second-biggest YouTube channel. The partnership makes sense for Spotify India as T-Series is home to 160,000 Bollywood songs. But Spotify hasn't been able to convince other major labels, Sony, Universal and Warner, to get on board with its India plans. While initial reports suggested Spotify would launch in India without them, the delayed launch could only mean the music streaming service is trying to ink a deal with these three music labels before its big debut in India. So, it's safe to assume Spotify will launch its services in India as soon as it completes its deals with Sony, Universal and Warner. In addition to that, Spotify is currently available in English only, which may be the case until the launch. But the popular streaming service could add music in five languages, including Punjabi, Malayalam, Bengali, Tamil and Telugu, shortly after launch. This is essential for Spotify to attract the masses in India with regional content and its global strategy won't reap as many benefits in India as it does internationally due to stiff competition from major services like JioSaavn and Gaana. Even then, Spotify will fall short in terms of local content library as JioSaavn has 45 million songs in 15 languages with expansion plans in the offing. Free trial and subscription plans Like most services, Spotify will also offer a free trial post its launch in India. But if the reports are to be believed, Spotify's free trial will extend beyond 30 days – a standard for a free trial for most services. Once the free trial ends, Spotify's subscription plans will kick in. According to reports, users will have to pay Rs 140 per month to continue using the service. As compared to Spotify's international plans, where it costs $9.99 per month, the subscription plan in India seems reasonable. Spotify could offer other tiers for paying subscribers, but the details remain to be seen. Even then, Spotify faces stiff competition from JioSaavn, which is offering 90-day free trial followed by Rs 99 a month plan. For a full year, JioSaavn charges Rs 999, which works out at Rs 83 a month. Similarly, Apple Music charges users Rs 120 a month in India, while another major rival for Spotify in India is Amazon Prime Music, which is a part of Rs 999-worth Prime loyalty programme. Will Spotify emerge as a winner despite stiff competition in India? We just have to wait and watch.","

409,2019-01-11,18:41:28,technology,internet,"How to get 1000GB free data with Airtel broadband in Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and other cities"," Airtel and Reliance Jio have been in a tug-of-war ever since the latter made its entry into the telecom space and changed the face of the industry. After making mobile internet packages extremely affordable, which led to a spike in the country's data consumption, Reliance Jio is now entering the broadband space with Jio GigaFiber. To avoid history to repeat itself, incumbents like Airtel have been ramping up their efforts to stay on top of their game in the high-speed fiber broadband category. Reliance Jio's GigaFiber commercial launch is slated for March 2019, but Airtel has come up with some attractive offers that could be hard even for Jio to top. In addition to offering discounts on annual and bi-annual broadband plans, Airtel has removed FUP limits in select circles. But that's not even the best part. Airtel is offering bonus data up to 1TB (1000GB) for its broadband customers in select circles. Since Airtel V-Fiber plans change from one circle to another, the bonus data allotment varies as well. Customers in Hyderabad have no bonus data offer, which makes sense as all plans come with unlimited GBs of data. In Delhi, Gurgaon, Noida, Faridabad and Ghaziabad circles, customers get 500GB bonus data on the Rs 799 monthly broadband package, which usually gives 100GB data at 40Mbps speed. Those on higher packages, including Rs 999, Rs 1,299 and Rs 1,999 with 100Mbps speed, get 1000GB bonus data. These plans also get the benefit of data rollover and free Netflix and Amazon Prime subscription. In Bengaluru, the 40Mbps broadband plan worth Rs 799 with 50GB monthly data gets 500GB bonus data, while Rs 999 plan with 40Mbps speed and 100GB data limit gets 750GB additional data with rollover benefit and Netflix and Amazon Prime subscription. The higher-end packages with a monthly rental of Rs 1,299 and Rs 2,099 that offer up to 100Mbps speeds get 1000GB bonus data on top of 175GB and 350GB monthly data allotment, respectively. Both these plans also get rollover data benefit and Netflix, Amazon Prime subscription for free. Airtel V-Fiber customers can check for bonus data offer in their individual circles by visiting Airtel's official website. It must be noted that the bonus data offer is valid till March 31, 2019, and it is applicable to half-year and annual packages, which saves 15-20 percent on monthly rentals. These offers are exceptional and a power play by India's biggest telecom provider ahead of Jio GigaFiber's arrival. Reliance Jio hasn't revealed its plans for GigaFiber broadband in India, but they are expected to be cheaper than current standards. Reliance Jio is also offering free service to select users in Delhi and Mumbai circles as a part of its testing before a wider rollout. It won't be surprising if the free preview offer extends to the general public for the initial months. But Airtel's efforts to make sure its customers get the maximum value out of its broadband packages indicates a touch crack for Jio. Stay tuned for updates. ","

If that hasn't worked out for you, there might finally be some good news. India Today is reporting that Reliance Jio GigaFiber services will start in major cities by March 2019. There's no exact launch date, but GigaFiber is said to enter tier II and tier III cities as well. Currently, Jio GigaFiber is available for limited users in Mumbai and Delhi. Reliance Jio boasts of executing largest greenfield fixed-line broadband rollout anywhere in the world with its GigaFiber service rolling out in 1,100 cities simultaneously. This is only the first phase of the rollout, which will include cities like Agra, Bengaluru, Chennai, Chandigarh, Ranchi, Patna, Allahabad, Raipur, Nagpur, Ghaziabad, Pune, Indore, Thane, Bhopal, Lucknow, Ludhiana, Madurai, Nashik, and Guwahati among others. Anticipating users can expect to hear more on the commercial rollout in March. Reliance Jio also hasn't shared details of its plans, including the prices. But there's a Jio GigaFiber preview offer that's being offered to early adopters. Under the GigaFiber preview offer, users must pay a refundable deposit of Rs 4,500 towards the GigaFiber router and GigaTV set-top-box. Then, users will get 100GB data with up to 100Mbps speed for 90 days for free. If you exhaust the allotted data, there's an option to top up 40GB data via MyJio app or Jio.com, although pricing on the same is still unknown. Going by some reports, Jio GigaFiber plans are expected to for start as low as Rs 500 a month, where users get 300GB data at 50Mbps speeds. The next tier will be Rs 750 a month for 450GB data at 50Mbps speeds. The telco will also offer two mid-level plans at Rs 999 and Rs 1,299, which will give 600GB and 750GB of data at 100Mbps, respectively. The top-end package will come at Rs 1,500 that will give 900GB at speeds up to 150Mbps. At these rates, Reliance Jio will give tough competition to the existing telcos, including Airtel, BSNL and ACT Fibernet. Besides offering internet at high speeds, Reliance Jio could offer landline, IPTV and smart home solutions, but at a later point. ","

411,2019-01-04,19:31:00,technology,internet,"CastHack: Here's how to protect Wi-Fi router from hackers taking over Chromecast, smart TV"," Earlier in the week, three ethical hackers, in their bid to check the security of the Chromecast, hacked the media streaming device to play PewDiePie videos and also took control of Google Home smart speakers and smart TVs. Initially, Google was falsely blamed for failing to fix the CastHack bug, which was first noticed by Petro, a senior security analyst at the consultancy Bishop Fox in 2014, just a year after the Chromecast's debut. He made a remote using Raspberry Pi computer chip, two wireless card, a touchscreen and all assembled in a 3D-printed plastic enclosure. With the home-made gadget, he was able to send a 'Deauth' command to Chromecast to disconnect from the Wi-Fi network. When the Chromecast reboots, it gets in reconfiguration mode by turning itself into a Wi-Fi hotspot and waits for local computer or any nearby internet connected device for commands. Then the hacker can control the Chromecast thereby play any content on the TV. It was Petro's method to prank his friends. It can be noted that to send 'Deauth' command, the hacker has to be in physical proximity of the Chromecast (at least 100 feet) and have an AP (Application Programm) installed to re-direct the Chromecast. Most importantly, network passwords are not exposed in either case. Google spokesperson has confirmed to International Business Times India Edition, that it is working on an update to prevent deauth attacks. So, consumers are advised not to be apprehensive in using or buying the Chromecast. So, how the hackers (TheHackerGiraffe, j3ws3r and @friendlyh4xx0r) took control of the Chromecast, earlier this week? Well, it has now come to light that they actually made use of security loophole in Wi-Fi routers, which the Chromecast connects wirelessly via Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) protocol. There is a solution to protect Chromecast from such attacks. To restrict the ability for external videos to be played on devices, users can turn off Universal Plug and Play (UPnP). It can be noted that turning off UPnP may disable some devices (e.g. printers, game consoles, etc.) that depend on it for local device discovery. Step 1: Access the router's web-based setup page. For instructions, click here. NOTE: If you are using a Mac computer, click here. Step 2: On the web-based setup page, click Administration. Step 3: Select your desired setting for UPnP (To protect Chromecast, tap disable).","

413,2018-12-25,18:45:00,technology,internet,Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K review: Best media streaming device gets better," Amazon opened the pre-order service for Fire TV Stick 4K in India in October 2018 and was made available for purchase from 14 November onwards for Rs 5,999. The new media streaming device comes with several upgrades in both the Fire TV Stick 4K module and the smart remote controller over the predecessor. I have been using the new model for close to a month and here is my take on the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K. Design: The new Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K comes with familiar design including the main module with protruding HDMI jack, power cable, Alexa-powered remote and the retail package also comes with extended HDMI adaptor, which comes very handy when docking the TV Stick at the backend of the TV in tight spaces. I have a fixed mount TV on the wall and had very less space to put the device into the HDMI port on the back, but this accessory was really helpful. As far as the remote is concerned, it comes with 11 buttons and thanks to ergonomic design, my fingers of puny hand was able to reach all of them easily. The keys are placed aptly in the right places for the thumb to reach the most commonly used controls. Even the existing Fire TV Stick users can buy Alexa Voice Remote for Rs 1,999 on Amazon. User-interface: It is one of the simplest interfaces to understand and I hardly took 15 minutes to set up including connecting Fire TV Stick 4K to the TV's HDMI port and login into the Amazon Prime Video account and was good to use in no time. Now that the remote support Alexa and can control TV's volume directly, it felt effortless for me to browse the Prime Video contents. But, have to say, I enjoyed more controlling the TV using the Amazon Echo smart speaker. The icing on the cake was, the latter was intuitive enough to directly perform actions without asking questions. I never had to complete the command with 'on Fire TV'. It automatically fetches the movie or TV show title on the television. For instance, I just called 'Alexa, open The Dark Knight', it fetched the title and said Alexa play the movie. It started playing. I have been told that Amazon Echo will also be able to perform for many apps not just Amazon Prime Video on Fire TV Stick. Final thoughts: Having used the predecessor for several months, I noticed marked improvements in the new Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K, the speed of response to the remote control and also the swiftness in recognising the voice via Alexa-powered voice command button on the remote is impressive. To top it off, the ease of use with Echo Spot in the living room has brought in more convenience than ever before. I have to admit, Fire TV Stick 4K has made me lazy; I no longer waste time if don't find the remote, I just switch the HMDI on my main TV remote and just ask the Echo Spot to browse for TV shows and control volume. Though Fire TV Stick 4K needs higher internet bandwidth of minimum 10mbps speed, it's not a deal breaker, as the video and audio quality is so much good and all these capabilities for Rs 5,999, is just unbelievable. If you want to get more out of your high resolution LED TV, Amazon TV Stick 4K is the best media streaming device to buy and will serve you well. Pros: Cons:","

414,2018-12-24,11:28:44,technology,internet,Huawei hopes to untangle 5G mess by surrendering source code," Chinese telecom equipment maker Huawei's willingness to make available the source code may ease the path for its participation in Indian 5G trials amid continuing US security worries, reports say. Huawei has expressed willingness to place the source code in escrow with New Delhi to allay security fears. The US government has warned Huawei equipment users worldwide of the suspected presence of embedded spyware that could make possible Chinese surveillance of networks. Australia and New Zealand have acted on the advice by banning Huawei on the heels of US action against the telecommunication giant. Huawei has also been facing US investigation over helping Iran violate sanctions. A full-fledged diplomatic row has erupted involving the US, Canada, and China after Ottawa arrested a senior Huawei official and founder's daughter Meng Wanzhou, who has since been released on bail. Huawei CEO Jay Chen has said his company was the only one to make available the source code in 2010 to India, a report said. ""In 2010, we were the only equipment company which offered to place the software code of the equipment in an escrow to the Indian government, when similar questions on security were raised. We are willing to do the same again for 5G so that there are no apprehensions,"" a report in Business Standard quoted Chen as saying. Telecom experts are of the view that the control over the software codes will enable the government to check for security breaches in the network at any time or ascertain any spyware activity. The reference Chen made to 2010 was about the time when the company faced a ban from telecom projects on bidding for BSNL projects in sensitive areas like international borders. The authorities withdrew the restriction after a few months. Indian trade bodies have taken different positions regarding the controversy. India's Telecom Equipment and Services Export Promotion Council, which represents domestic Indian manufacturers, have also expressed reservations over Huawei's security record. It wrote to National Security Adviser Ajit Doval seeking restrictions on the use of telecom equipment made by all Chinese manufacturers including Huawei and ZTE. But, the Cellular Operators Association of India has urged the government not to make any hasty decision banning Huawei. Reports say Chen has clarified that the company was ready to comply with any other conditions the government might set for the 5G rollout. Huawei has also been facing US investigation over helping Iran violate sanctions. A full-fledged diplomatic row has erupted involving the US, China and Canada after Ottawa arrested a senior Huawei official and founder's daughter Meng Wanzhou, who has since been released on bail.","

416,2018-11-30,14:15:11,technology,internet,Chinese firm's plan for free Wi-Fi worldwide may trigger security concerns," A Chinese technology firm's plan to provide free Wi-Fi service worldwide through an ambitious constellation of satellites has the potential to trigger security concerns in many countries. Shanghai-based LinkSure Network, which specialises in mobile internet connectivity, unveiled the first of the 272 satellites that it plans to send to space earlier this week. Wi-Fi is a highly sought after service, especially in the developing world that suffers from weak mobile phone networks and high data charges. The offer of free Wi-Fi unless nationally monitored could have serious security implications, some experts suggest. The US has already sounded a security alert regarding some Chinese mobile phones including those made by Huawei. The security concerns from free Wi-Fi plan are heightened by China's plans to put in place a navigational satellite system rivalling US GPS. LinkSure Network will launch the first satellite next year from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in Northwest China's Gansu province, and plans another 10 satellites by 2020, state newspaper China Daily said on Thursday. The constellation will be complete by 2026. People can use the free connectivity even in areas that do not get the mobile phone signals, the report said. According to Wang Jingying, CEO of LinkSure Network, the estimated project cost is $431.4 million. The company hopes to recover the investment over an undisclosed period of time without giving details of the likely revenue streams. United Nations estimates show there were 3.9 billion people not connected to the internet by the end of 2017. Satellites are seen as the alternative to installing terrestrial infrastructure in areas where the topography is difficult. Some global technology giants like Google, SpaceX, OneWeb and Telesat have already announced similar projects to use satellites to provide free internet access. But LinkSure Network's plans gain significance in the backdrop of the plans of China's plans to build a satellite navigation system rivalling theUS Global Positioning System (GPS) used widely around the globe. The BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS hopes to be the fourth global satellite navigation system after the US GPS system, Russia's GLONASS and the European Union's Galileo. India has built its own regional satellite navigation system called Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS). The Indian Space Research Organisation website says the system known as Navic has a constellation of seven satellites on the orbit that provides a coverage of the whole of the Indian subcontinent up to a distance of 1,500km from the national borders. India has kept more satellites on the standby mode on the ground, completing the network as of April 2018.","

Internet security firm ThousandEyes, which is a client of Google service noticed that Google search and also related G Suite for enterprises were disrupted between 1:00 pm PST (2:30 am IST) and 2:23 pm PST (3:53 am IST). ""The outage not only affected G Suite but also Google Search as well as Google Analytics. What caught our attention was that traffic to Google was getting dropped at China Telecom. Why would traffic from a San Francisco office traversing to Google go all the way to China? We also noticed a Russian ISP in the traffic path, which definitely sparked some concerns,"" noted ThousandEyes on its blog post. Also, the search traffic was also diverted to Nigeria-based Internet Service Provider (ISP). Experts are hinting that there might be involvement of state-sponsored cyber teams, as China Telecom, TransTelecom and ISP MainOne are all controlled by governments of China, Russia and Nigeria, respectively. It is believed that the cybercriminals used Border Gate Protocol (BGR) hijack techniques for an illegitimate takeover of groups of IP addresses by corrupting Internet routing tables and apparently diverted the search and also interrupted business causing the denial of service responses on G Suite. This technique can be used for espionage and financial theft. Also, ThousandEyes also noted that search traffic diversion was primarily propagated by business-grade transit providers and did not impact consumer ISP networks as much. But, more serious things can happen in future if Google or any technology company don't act now to fix loopholes in internet security. Recent search diversion was just ""a war-game experiment"" The Washington Times quoted, Henthorn-Iwane, security expert, as saying. Google has not made any official comment on the disruption of G Suite service, just yet.","

He was speaking at the India Mobile Congress (IMC), one of the biggest marquee Mobile, Internet, and Technology event for South and South-East Asia. The move is part of the infrastructure called Bharat Wi-Fi, and is believed to be a fresh step in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Digital India initiative. According to an official statement from the Ministry of Communications, Bharat Wi-Fi is ""a country-wide common inter-operable platform of one million Wi-Fi Hotspots, owned and operated by telecom service providers, internet service providers and virtual network operators."" It added: ""This initiative allows consumers to access Wi-Fi Hotspots of any of the partnering operators."" While more details on Bharat Wi-Fi are awaited, it is believed that it will help generate 5 lakh employment opportunities. Both the hotspots and employment opportunities may help boost Modi's chances of returning to power in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. For one, if everything goes as per plan, Wi-Fi hotspots at many places across the country will help the prime minister tout the success of the Digital India initiative. Also, the extra jobs created will help him counter the Opposition's charges on unemployment and lack of employment opportunities in India, which should give the BJP some much-needed political mileage on that front. Meanwhile, Sinha also unveiled the National Frequency Allocation Plan 2018 (NFAP) at the event. The NFAP, according to the ministry statement, ""released a quantum of 605 MHz licence exempt spectrum in 5GHz band for Wireless Access Services and Radio Local Area Networks in outdoor, to meet the ever-growing appetite for data (from a current figure of 50 MHz since 2007).""","

429,2021-01-04,20:15:51,technology,games,Father proud of his 3-year-old daughter playing M-rated GTA game; it's inspirational," Grand Theft Auto is a matured-rated game suited for teens and adults for the violent and gory content that it brings. From murder to theft and prostitution to drugs, the GTA series has it all. No parents in their sanity would want their young kids playing the game. But little did anyone know how a game like GTA could actually be good even for 3-year-olds. Yes, you read that right. A father-daughter duo from Japan has redefined the entire nature of the GTA game, making it suitable even for young, really young kids. A Japanese Twitter user learned about this 3-year-old playing the M-rated game and her father allowing it and as anyone would react, he was surprised. After seeing how the young Japanese girl was playing GTA under the supervision of her father, he couldn't believe to have seen such a side of the popular game even exists. A good Samaritan In a viral tweet, Twitter user sakai0129 said: ""When my friend told me, 'My three-year-old daughter has been playing Grand Theft Auto' I thought he was crazy. But then he explained, 'She never steals cars, and waits at intersections for the light to turn green, just like you're supposed to in real life. She takes the helicopters for peaceful sightseeing flights and rides the trains.'"" If you take a second to think and reflect, it is actually possible. All that violence, theft is all optional. The smart father was able to turn the game, which is suitable for adults for its content, into an educational tool and no one saw that coming. Netizens laud, advise caution Several users reacted positively, lauding the father and daughter for turning GTA into an educational tool. However, there must be great responsibility as the GTA is designed in such a way that even the slightest wrong action could have repercussions like bumping into a random civilian could trigger them to hit you or even start shooting at you. This is something a 3-year-old shouldn't learn. But the Twitter user clarified that his friend supervises his daughter while playing the game, ensuring she doesn't trigger any aggression, walk into violent heists or strip clubs in the game.","

PUBG Corp is launching a new version of the game just for India and calling it ""PUBG Mobile India"" that will have a legal route into the Indian shores without the China-connection. PUBG Mobile India is going to maximise data security and even cater to local preferences. Mobile tipster Ishan Agarwal revealed that PUBG Corp is going to invest $100 million for the Indian subsidiary that will boost the Indian eSports arena and IT industry. This is just one of the few careful steps PUBG took to make sure it can distance itself from China's Tencent to make its way back into India. Besides a generous investment, PUBG Mobile India is going to use Microsoft Azure for data management. By showing Tencent the door, Krafton and PUBG Corp. will be running the show here in India and already plans to hire 100 employees for the job. Above all, PUBG Mobile India will comply with all norms of the Indian IT Ministry for data security, which was the primary reason behind the ban of the game in India in the first place. Going by this four-pronged strategy, it looks like PUBG Mobile is off to another good start. PUBG Mobile for India will be customised further. The company said: ""To build and foster a healthy gameplay environment, in-game content will be improved and tailored to reflect local needs. Various aspects of the game will be customized for Indian gamers, such as the game now being set in a virtual simulation training ground, new characters automatically starting clothed, and green hit effects to reflect the virtual nature of the game. More importantly, the company will include a feature that places restrictions on game time to promote healthy gameplay habits for younger players."" Excitement is still there With Diwali just around the corner, PUBG Mobile's unban in India is going to be the ideal gift for all the eSports champions and players alike. The excitement of the game getting unbanned in India has already set the right spirit on Twitter with cheering echoes. TSM famous players Jonathan and Abhijeet Andhare have hinted at the game's return to India. Similarly, popular PUBG streamer Scout said he will be grinding PUBG from the coming week and he will stream for 2 hours a day. India's big esports influencer Ocean Sharma hinted about something good cooking up, while Rishab Karanwal, member of Rakazone Gaming was more direct to say PUBG Mobile is back. Finally, Dynamo also shared his excitement in a tweet - all of which points towards PUBG Mobile's imminent launch in India sooner than later. PUBG Mobile unban in India Although the news of PUBG's unban in India is exciting, we cannot say it is entirely surprising. PUBG Corp has been finding different ways to overcome the ban. It was recently reported that PUBG was reportedly in talks with global cloud service providers to offer support by storing Indian users' data within the country, complying with the government's guidelines. The decision to go with a global reputed brand like Microsoft Azure is sure to remove some red flags. A marketing campaign for PUBG's return in India was expected to happen around Diwali an we already see major streamers talk about the game, so that's another point off the checklist. ","

Over the recent weeks, there have been reports that PUBG Corp has been distancing itself from China's Tencent to make its way back to lost fame and glory in India. PUBG Mobile, among other Chinese apps, was removed from Google Play Store and Apple App Store soon after the ban was announced by the Indian govt in September to preserve the country's sovereignty and integrity. But the game itself continued to work on phones it was already downloaded on to, but that too ended last month when Tencent Games turned off the servers and stopped their support in India. Will PUBG Mobile return? Not all hope is lost for the return of PUBG Mobile to India. TechCrunch, citing its sources, revealed in a new report that PUBG Mobile will be back in India before the end of this year. PUBG Corp is reportedly conducting talks with global cloud service providers to offer support by storing Indian users' data within the country, complying with the government's guidelines. If the ongoing efforts pull through, PUBG Mobile might finally be back and sources revealed that an announcement might come as early as this week. ""It also plans to run a marketing campaign in the country during the festival of Diwali next week, one of the sources said."" PUBG fans could be in for the biggest Diwali surprise this year. An official statement on the matter hasn't been revealed, so we'd advise you to take this bit of information with a pinch of salt unless otherwise confirmed.","

Tencent Games, which owns the mobile game, said on Facebook that it ""deeply regrets this outcome"" and thanked PUBG Mobile and PUBG Mobile Lite fans for their support in India. The company said on Thursday that ""protecting user data has always been a top priority and we have always complied with applicable data protection laws and regulations in India. All users' gameplay information is processed in a transparent manner as disclosed in our privacy policy"". The announcement came on the back of the Indian government's decision to ban PUBG Mobile and PUBG Mobile Lite on September 2. The game was banned under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act. PUBG in India PUBG Corporation recently announced that they are withdrawing their partnership with Tencent, and that they will work with the Indian government to look for a quick resolution. PUBG game, which has more than 600 million downloads and 50 million active players globally, has nearly 33 million users in India. PUBG Mobile saw a global revenue gain of $1.3 billion (roughly Rs 9,731 crore) in the first half of this year, bringing its lifetime collection to $3 billion (nearly Rs 22,457 crore) with the highest number of downloads in India which ranks at the top with 175 million installs as people stayed home owing to the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdowns.

In fact, Indians seem to have found a loophole to bypass the ban and be able to download and play PUBG Mobile. But all those extra steps and efforts won't be necessary as PUBG Mobile's return to India is imminent. It's a matter of when rather than if. After PUBG Corporation cut ties with Tencent for its popular mobile game in September, there was a ray of hope for players. Now, there's another prominent hint about the game's return to India after the government banned hundred other Chinese apps in order to preserve the country's sovereignty and integrity. Shortly after, PUBG Mobile was removed from Play Store and App Store, with no official way to download the app legally. Using VPN and other means is a whole another story. PUBG Mobile is coming back PUBG Corp has posted a job listing on LinkedIn for a Corporate Development Division Manager in the country. The job requirement is for an individual to support the setup process of PUBG India with guidance from Krafton Inc, developing and monitoring the pipeline of potential M&A, investments and strategic partnership opportunities in gaming and related sectors in India, and more. Whatever be the case, players of the game haven't been deprived of access to PUBG Mobile as the servers are still working as before. But the official lifting of the ban would mean players won't have to use VPN or download the game from third-party stores.","

But even after the decision, players are at ease that they can still play the game even after Google Play Store and Apple App Store removed PUBG Mobile.

PUBG Mobile working after ban If you are excited about PUBG Mobile still working despite being banned in India, don't be so sure. The reason PUBG Mobile is still working for players who already have it on their phone is because the servers are still active. Once the government blocks the servers, you will no longer be able to play the game. But this suspense can be intimidating as any moment now the servers will be blocked and PUBG Mobile will be completely banned. Now, there are other ways to play the game despite the ban, which is by using a VPN.

The game was so engaging that at one point health experts warned of addiction and it was close to getting banned. But it didn't. That changed on Wednesday as the Indian government announced that it is banning PUBG Mobile and 117 other apps of Chinese origin. With PUBG Mobile gone, hundreds and thousands of players will be flocking to other titles, which is where games like Call of Duty: Mobile, Fortnite and others gain traction. But the ban itself has crushed many Indian youngsters who would spend hours roaming the empty roads of Erangel and snipe the enemies camouflaged in a gillie suit. Many hearts crushed, but the love for nation keeps the spirits alive. PUBG Mobile ban, like the TikTok ban, won't be the end of the world for many, but it certainly leaves a void.

Its early success is legit proof that people loved the game. Over the years, the title witnessed a fair share of ups and downs. On one hand, concerns were raised on the addiction to the game and on the other, gamers loved the frequent updates to the game that kept them hooked to their phone screens. But in a major blow yet to the free-to-play title, PUBG Mobile has been banned in India. This is part of the Indian government's ongoing effort to ban Chinese apps in the country and it comes at a crucial time when both countries are in the midst of escalating border conflicts. With PUBG Mobile gone, millions of players in India would be lost in the real world, trying to get back into the virtual gaming space. Luckily, the ban on PUBG Mobile in India paves way for other games from a similar genre to get in the spotlight. PUBG Mobile alternatives Call of Duty Mobile: This is by far the closest thing to PUBG Mobile. Be it terms of gameplay, graphics and more. Call of Duty: Mobile joined the race much later than PUBG Mobile, but it grew in popularity given the title's fame in the non-mobile space. Call of Duty: Mobile is published under the banner of Activision, an American company, and developed by a subsidiary of Tencent Games, TiMi Studios. COD Mobile brings fast-paced gameplay and players can choose from Battle Royale or Multiplayer. Much like PUBG Mobile, 100 players combat to survive in the end, but players must choose the operator class, which makes it more engaging. COD Mobile is available for free on Android as well as on iOS platforms. Fortnite: Another game developed by an American company, Epic Games. Fortnite's popularity is incredible on PC and consoles and the fact that it is available on mobile platforms gives it an edge against rivals. The graphics are not like PUBG Mobile, but Fortnite's cartoonish graphics are in line with the title. The gameplay involves 100 players dropped off on an island, where they use resources and weapons to eliminate others. Fortnite is not PUBG or COD, but it has a nice and unique touch, which many would love and definitely worth a shot if you're moving away from PUBG Mobile in India. It is available for free on both Android and iOS platforms. Free-Fire: Free-Fire is a PUBG Mobile clone. It is more like a lite version of the PUBG Mobile, which pits 50 players against one another. The graphics are sub-par, but it supports low-end phones, so we know where its target audience is. Free Fire is available for free on Android and iOS platforms and it is developed by Garena, a Singapore based publisher. Battlelands Royale: And if you like even lower graphics, a 32-bit Royale game developed by Finnish developer Futureplay is worth a shot. It's completely different from PUBG and COD, but let's just call it a unique take on battle-royale for someone who doesn't want to get too involved with the mobile gaming.","

The popular game has amassed a huge following of 350 million players and is available on multiple platforms. It was initially launched for the Android platform last year in partnership with Samsung. Samsung said its Galaxy Store enables users to navigate through an exhaustive catalogue of apps in 12 Indian languages, in addition to English. Soon after Apple removed the popular video game Fortnite from its App Store for allegedly violating in-app payment guidelines, Epic Games has announced a free Fortnite tournament on August 23 where players can compete to win anti-Apple prizes. ""All of your friends. Fabulous prizes. And one bad apple. We're dropping the #FreeFortnite Cup on August 23,"" the company said in a tweet. Epic also reminded iOS players that they won't be able to play the next season of Fortnite and also suggested iOS players migrate to other platforms like Android where Fortnite is available before the next season begins.","

453,2020-08-14,01:48:07,technology,games,Epic Games sues Apple over Fortnite's removal from App Store," Epic Games, the renowned game publisher and developer, is retaliating against Apple's decision to kick off Fortnite from App Store - preventing downloads on iPhones and iPads. The iPhone maker removed the popular battle royale title from its app marketplace after the developer implemented its own in-app payment system that bypassed Apple's 30 percent cut for the listing, The Verge reported. Now, Epic Games, through its lawsuit, is trying to establish Apple's monopoly and seeks to allow fair competition in mobile app distribution for third-party app developers. Epic Games is not seeking monetary compensation nor favorable treatment towards a single company. ""Epic brings this suit to end Apple's unfair and anti-competitive actions that Apple undertakes to unlawfully maintain its monopoly in two distinct, multibillion-dollar markets: (i) the iOS App Distribution Market, and (ii) the iOS In-App Payment Processing Market(each as defined below),"" the complaint reads. Apple vs Epic Games feud Apple said Epic Games violated the App Store guidelines by pushing its own in-app payment system, which wasn't reviewed or approved by Apple. Epic argues that it's unfair Apple requires developers to use its payment methods, which gives Apple 30 percent of all in-app revenue. Apple says Epic's apps have been on the App Store for a decade and have also benefitted from it - be its tools, testing distribution that all developers get. In fact, Apple said it was making ""every effort to work with Epic to resolve these violations so they can return Fortnite to the App Store."" It's not clear how the lawsuit changes those peace talks. But it's definitely not a sign of Fortnite's return to the App Store - at least for the time being. And, for those unaware, Epic has its own payment system in the Android version of Fortnite and Google is yet to take any action","

A warm welcome Shroud fired up Riot's new tactical shooter Valorant as he began streaming on Twitch after over a year. He did hit a snag, which caused some delay in starting his stream on time, but the followers didn't mind. He's been maintaining 400,000 to 475,000 active viewers. Shroud was able to retain his original Twitch account, which commanded a 7.3 million strong follower base.

455,2020-08-07,01:00:43,technology,games,PUBG Mobile players must drop everything and do this before next match," There's some exciting news for PUBG Mobile players - with a big catch. After much anticipation, PUBG Mobile players finally get a chance to play their favourite game in a much smoother setting. For those who haven't guessed, the most-requested feature of PUBG Mobile in 90fps has finally arrived for select phones for a limited period. PUBG Mobile at 90fps PUBG Mobile players will be able to play the game at 90fps provided they have a OnePlus smartphone. The new setting is available on select OnePlus phones, including OnePlus 8 series, OnePlus 7T series and OnePlus 7 Pro. Despite having a capable display, PUBG Mobile won't be available at 90fps on OnePlus Nord, which seems like a natural decision considering the Snapdragon 765G processor. ""With PUBG MOBILE being one of the world's most popular mobile games over the past two years running, we would like to pursue the gameplay performance to a higher level. OnePlus's cutting-edge mobile technology is delivering the faster and smoother experience to global users. We are happy to start the 90 FPS exclusivity with OnePlus. Today's transition to 90 FPS is a great step towards PUBG MOBILE's exhilarating gameplay,"" PUBG Mobile spokesperson said in a statement. There's another catch While OnePlus users have this exclusive feature to boast about, it's not permanent. PUBG Mobile at 90fps is available for OnePlus users for a limited preview period of one month from August 6 till September 6, 2020. But it's only a matter of time before PUBG Mobile brings the much-awaited feature to the masses.","

The character will only come to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. ""Watching Spider-Man adapt to new surroundings was such a great contrast to his status quo. That tone is exactly what we want to capture for him in Marvel's Avengers. A familiar but fresh Spider-Man who needs to evolve to take on global threats alongside Earth's Mightiest Heroes."" That being said, even if players buy the latest Avengers video game, they won't be able to play as Spider-Man right away. It's been confirmed that Spider-Man's character will be added as a DLC in early 2021 and players can download the content for free. ""When he's arcing through the air on his web line, we want you to feel graceful and light, and be able to utilize a variety of web configurations and gadgets to enhance your traversal. Spider-Man's impressive acrobatic abilities will complement the experience, allowing you to seamlessly transition from navigation to combat,"" Adams further wrote in the blog. Marvel's Avengers video game plot: Just like MCU, the upcoming Marvel's Avengers video game will show all the superheroes joining hands to defeat the enemy that has put the lives of people of Earth in jeopardy. The game will be played in a third-person and would combine a cinematic story with single-player gameplay. Unlike the recently released games like Red Red Redemption II and The Last of Us Part II, Avengers video game would be narrative-driven but it won't have ""open-world"" features to it. That means that the players will have to follow the presented storyline and there won't be other stuff they can do when they are following the missions. Marvel's Avengers video game is set to be released for Stadia, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on September 4, 2020.","

459,2020-07-01,22:19:53,technology,games,"PUBG Mobile, Call of Duty not banned in India; here's why"," The Government of India recently banned 59 Chinese apps on concerns over the safety and security of user data and privacy of Indians. However, the biggest doubt on everyone's mind is, why the PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds or PUBG or the Call of Duty Mobile battle royale game did not find any mention in the list of banned apps? After PUBG became popular, Tencent -- a Chinese conglomerate -- joined hands with Bluehole to market the product in China and started handling a large portion of its distribution. The game is distributed in India by Tencent Holdings. The game did not feature in the banned list due to its mixed ownership, since it's not entirely Chinese. The Call of Duty Mobile, even though owned by Tencent Games, has still not been banned in India and users can continue to play the game on Android and iOS. Call of Duty Mobile is the mobile version of the famous video game series 'Call of Duty'. The game received massive response during beta testing, as well as when it was released. COD Mobile, which is one of the most loved mobile gaming apps, is developed by an American tech company called Activision Blizzard in partnership with Tencent Game, the company behind PUBG Mobile and Timi. Tencent Holdings also has 5 per cent ownership in Activision Blizzard. While one cannot dismiss the game's Chinese links, its mixed-ownership could have played a role in the government's decision to not omit COD from its list of banned apps. (With inputs from IANS)","

Besides all that, one particular picture of the PS5 went viral, depicting the massiveness of the next-gen gaming console. Since the official dimensions of the console haven't been revealed by Sony, people were convinced the PS5 is a giant block. In the picture, the PS5 sits besides Xbox Series X, making the latter look like a dwarf. At first glance, it sure looks like the case, but upon closer inspection, there are some discrepancies. Fact check By deciphering the picture of the giant PS5, we can deduce that the image is fake. The PS5 is definitely bigger than other consoles in the market and bigger than its own older versions, but definitely not as big as portrayed in the image. Looking closely at both the consoles, specifically their front-facing USB ports as reference points, will show the size discrepancies. Both the consoles have been photoshopped into one image, but in doing so the PlayStation 5 appears to be slightly magnified. Forbes further identified other details such as the inconsistencies in the way shadows of both the consoles fall on the table. This confirms that the viral image is a photoshop Even so, we are still awaiting details on Sony PS5's dimensions.","

A Rockstar leaker has now confirmed that the story of the upcoming GTA is already finished and the gaming studio will soon enter into the development. As per a report by ScreenRant, the story of GTA 6 is apparently finished. User Liberty93 from Rockstar Mag (a French fansite dedicated to games developed by Rockstar) recently claimed that the story of Grand Theft Auto 6 was wrapped up prior to the departure of Rockstar's head writer, Dan Houser. The user went on to claim that the upcoming game will have the soul of the original series. This should be noted here that the story goes on to several changes when the game enters the development stage. The same happened with Rockstar's Red Dead Redemption 2 — the game's story was completed way back in 2012 but it went on multiple changes and it was then released for public in October 2018. So, if we follow Rockstar's previous development cycle and believe that the story of GTA 6 is indeed completed then we will have the game with us in 2026. That is a long wait to play the game but given the Rockstar's history, the game that we will get would surpass the popularity of all the previous games. What to expect from GTA 6? There have been several reports as to what gamers can expect from Grand Theft Auto 6. After the fantastic storyline and gameplay in GTA V, gamers are expecting to see the more open world and some great missions. There were several reports that GTA 6 will begin in London and will also have a female lead this time. In all the previous GTA series, there was not a single female lead and it would be amazing to see what Rockstar does with a female character as there is a lot of potential. As of now, there is no confirmation to when the next edition of GTA will release but since Rockstar released Red Dead Redemption 2 two years ago only and is still focused on the GTA V online missions and campaigns, it will probably take a couple of years to hear some substantial news from the studio.","

The move comes after Epic Games' objection to paying 30 percent royalties to Google for listing the game on Play Store.  ""Fortnite is now available on the Google Play Store,"" the company said in an official tweet. Fortnite was launched for Android 10 in mid-2019. However, Epic Games decided not to include the game in Google Play Store to do away with the 30 percent cut.  Fortnite saga Epic Games decided to launch the game for the Android platform last year in partnership with Samsung. However, the game was initially limited to some Samsung Galaxy smartphones, but later on, it was made available to other Android devices but via Epic Games' own app store. Epic Games said that it is now going to release the game through an official Android channel, which means the company will now pay Google the 30 percent cut mandated by the Play Store for all in-app purchases. Earlier, Epic tried to get an exemption to the 30 percent cut, calling the fee ""illegal"" for platforms with more than 50 percent market share. With this move, Fortnite will be able to cater to a larger audience who can now directly download the game from Play Store instead of having to go through an alternate source. PUBG Mobile, which has been available on Play Store from the start, could feel the heat of this move, but it remains to be seen how players will flock to Fortnite.  (With inputs from IANS)","

466,2020-04-14,20:09:49,technology,games,"Avoid these 'noob' mistakes in PUBG Mobile: Tips on camouflage, navigating, and more"," PUBG Mobile recently completed two years since its debut and the game is at its best form. The recent updates have made the gameplay more interesting than ever as millions of players enjoy the free-to-play battle-royale title. If you've been playing the game for a while, you would be well aware of the best practices to stay clear of enemy eyes and be able to take out a full squad with sheer planning. But if you're still trying to find your way around the game, these tips are going to come in handy. Camouflage You get spotted first, you get shot at first- this pretty much sums up the gameplay on any map in PUBG MOBILE. While loading up, the right kind of guns and ammo is important, but what's also critical is to stay low and out of the enemy's line of sight for as long as you can. So camouflaging could actually be your key to earn that majestic Chicken Dinner! The best trick for players is to select their outfit depending on the map. For Erangel and Sanhok it might be green or any dark colour while Miramar would require something brown and faded. Finally, you can go full white or any light shade attire for Vikendi ""Get to the safe zone"" Players once jump off the plane tend to get busy with the entire looting process. There are times when you don't get enough loot and houses are yet to be visited. A pro would always keep a car ready on the ground and keep looking at the map and the time. Once the blue zone comes closer you should call your team members to get in the car and run. A smart player would not want to pick a fight with an opponent while having low health. The navigator Unclear communications can lead to multiple confusions and once you're in the game you want things to be smooth and clear. A squad should only have one marksman who would mark locations on the map for others to follow. Multiple pins on the map can sometimes result in massive confusions and can be a reason for your defeat. Imagine a situation where your squad wants to go to Mylta and the pin is on Mylta Power. A little chivalry Even professional players lack these basic manners of closing the door. 100 people land on a map and there are chances a clan might have landed in a neighbouring town that is visible from the place your squad is looting. All it takes is a pro player with an 8X or 6X scope to notice the open doors and before your squad realises you're under attack. Lack of basic manners can sometimes compromise your squads' position. So guys, shut the door behind you. Reload Unlike old generation action games PUBG MOBILE does not notify users to reload their gun if they are on low Ammo. Another popular mistake players make, is after an action packed fight, they forget to reload their gun. What happens next is they spot an enemy and straight up indulge in a fight only to realize they don't have bullets in their gun to retaliate. A popular streamer once died because he did not reload.","

Cleavage, however, is unrestricted.  Twitch's new guidelines on nudity & attire Streamers must follow the updated Twitch guidelines: Sexual harassment on Twitch While Twitch, like any social platform, would want its streamers to have a clean feed without any sexually suggestive material, there haven't been stricter guidelines for viewers who harass female streamers on their clothing. Noted streamers like ExoHydraX and Forkgirl, were banned from the platform after being reported for their ""suggestive"" attire. The new guidelines certainly shed more light on what's permitted and what's not, there's another side to this story and it affects the female streamers. At the same time, the platform needs better tools to monitor and address gender-based harassment on its platform as there are several instances of female streamers who consider harassment as the ""biggest obstacle"" on Twitch. Just like streamers, the viewers are subject to pretty stringent guidelines hateful conduct, harassment. ""Harassment is any content or activity that attempts to intimidate, degrade, abuse, or bully others, or creates a hostile environment for others, and is prohibited. Depending on the severity of the offense, your account may be indefinitely suspended on the first violation. We prohibit using Twitch to facilitate hateful conduct or harassment, whether the targets are on or off Twitch."" Shockingly, female streamers are routinely harassed in the game and more often than not for the way they dress during IRL. It remains to be seen if these new guidelines will shut the misogynistic knuckleheads from sharing their opinions on one's attire (well within the Twitch guidelines) or give them more power to police around female streamers.","

The controller features all new colour theme and also has some added functionality both inside and outside. There is also an integrated microphone, a first for Sony's controllers, along with a USB-C port and an overhauled design.

The DualShock 4's share button, which allowed PlayStation 4 owners to quickly post screenshots and videos of their games, has been retained, but is now called the create button. Sony says the new button will operate in the same way but will have more functions that it will reveal in the future. Design-wise, the 'DualSense' has seen some notable changes. The two handles are less rectangular in shape and have a slight curve along the outer edge. The touchpad is also no longer rectangular, and appears to be a bit bigger overall. Both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X are slated to be launched in November, though things could change in the light of the coronavirus global pandemic.","

PUBG Mobile 0.17.0 marks the title's 2nd release anniversary and the beginning of its 12th season. According to most reports, it will be available by March 4th. PUBG Mobile 0.17.0 is a major update and brings along a wide range of features that players are going to enjoy. From a new game mode to upgraded weapon arsenal and more, PUBG's new update will keep its players hooked to their mobile phones longer. PUBG Mobile 0.17.0: What's new? Cold mode: Players can now play a cold survival mode in PUBG Mobile where they would have to survive by gathering firewood and burning it. They can even kill animals to eat during the 'extreme cold waves'. A timer will notify the starting of the cold waves and players must look for shelter. New markers: 8 different types of markers exist now, which are used to mark an attack point, ask for ammunition or to identify enemies and positions. Earlier there was only one strategic marker. Weapons: A new gun, DBS, will be seen in the new update. It is a double barrel pump-action shotgun best suited for close combats of up to 100 meters. DBS can have holographic, red-dot sight, 2x and 6x scopes attached to it. Also, the UZI will be revamped with a holographic and a red-dot sight, which will be really useful in close combats. New outfits: The update will feature new skins (outfits) like the robotic skin, TV man skin, a catgirl and a joker skin. Since new weapon skins are added in every new PUBG season, one can expect them in this 12th season too. Watch how you died: The 'death replay' existed only in the PC version. The new update brings it to the mobile version too and through it, players can see how they died. Colour-blind mode: This is the first time PUBG will be having a colour-blind mode which Tencent, the game's creator, had talked of adding it in 2020.

471,2020-02-27,15:30:08,technology,games,Official PlayStation Forum is shutting down: Marks 'end of an era'," A few days ago, Sony announced that the official PlayStation forum would be closing for good. The tech giant also remarked the event as an ""end of an era."" The forum has been helpful to the PlayStation community for many years. It was a one-stop resource for helpful content and also gave a sense of community for all PlayStation fans. However, the beloved forum is coming to a close today. The PlayStation forum was the first place where players of the PlayStation 2 era would go looking for help, ask questions, and discuss games. Over the past decade, the official forum also ended up building a huge database of questions and answers. Users that heard this sad news expressed their fond memories of being a long-time forum member, some even described it as a social meeting place for PlayStation fans. Besides announcing that the official forum is coming to close, Sony is yet to provide a reason behind this decision. When the company revealed the official PS5 logo on the forum, many gamers thought that it would stick to the 'traditional' ways of doing things for the upcoming next-gen console. However, the decision of shutting down the forum seems to tell a different story. Where can PlayStation fans connect now? Following the announcement, Sony has also encouraged PlayStation fans to continue conversations on the PlayStation.blog, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. And we aren't sure if these blogs or social media platforms will satisfy the same needs that members of the forum yearn. Since comments in blog posts are typically locked to specific posts and social media websites aren't great options for full-fledged human conversations, we are yet to see if this move works out in favour of the community. If you were a regular visitor to the PlayStation forum, it is understandable if this news could have been a hard pill to swallow. It is understandable that with changing times, things have to be adapted and reformed, but this news is still saddening. With the forum officially shutting down, we won't be getting the same support and collection of knowledge from anywhere else. Good 'ol memories!","

472,2020-01-09,17:44:42,technology,games,Unraveling Xbox Series X mystery: A look at the real ports?," Details about Xbox Series X have been scanty and fans are on the edge of their seat to know more about the next-gen console. Even Xbox Series X Director David Prien's ""why do people want to know specs of anything so far in advance?"" remark didn't help much in putting out people's curiosity. While the specs of the Xbox Series X remain a mystery, the console's rear ports might have just been revealed. After AMD showed an Xbox Series X imagery during a CES 2020 keynote, revealing the console's connectivity ports. But a clarification was issued later saying the image of Xbox Series X ""does not accurately represent the design or features of the upcoming console."" But that got people wondering what the setup is on the back of the next-gen gaming console. Lucky for you all, Thurrot's report spilt some beans. The mystery of ports in Xbox Series X According to the report, Xbox Series X features two USB-A ports in addition to the one on the front, an HDMI-out for your TV, an Ethernet port for the internet, optical audio and a power socket. There's another port on the back, which is suggested to be used for debugging and won't be seen on the production units. All the ports are arranged parallel in a vertical orientation, between two large air intake vents. Almost two-thirds of the rear panel is a plain black cover, much in line with the Xbox Series X overall design. If this is accurate, Microsoft isn't going with HDMI-in port and IR Blaster, suggesting TV integration features might get a miss in the upcoming generation of Xbox. But it is likely to affect the masses as very few might actually use HDMI-in. But what's surprising is that Microsoft hasn't tried to replace the USB-A with UBS Type-C port, which is slowly becoming a standard across all mobile devices. It's time gaming consoles match the trend. Microsoft hasn't announced the launch date for Xbox Series X, but it will likely be ready in time for the holidays this year. Xbox Series X could easily be on top of your Christmas shopping list later this year.","

473,2020-01-08,16:07:02,technology,games,PUBG Mobile 0.17.0 update: How to get unreleased version before anyone else?," PUBG Mobile players are being treated with frequent updates of late, introducing new features, weapons and game modes to enhance the gaming experience. Now, the developers of the popular battle-royale mobile title want some of its players to see what's to come before anyone else. This is made possible by recruiting beta testers. Majority of PUBG Mobile players are currently on 0.16.0 update and soon to receive 0.16.5 update with Season 11 changes among other new features. But some users have the opportunity to get selected as a beta tester, which will give them access to unreleased features in the game before the world sees them. How to become PUBG Mobile beta tester? PUBG Mobile has opted an unconventional method for its beta testing program. Instead of using the native beta program on App Store called TestFlight or on Play Store, PUBG Mobile is recruiting who can be a part of its exclusive beta club. While anyone can apply to become a PUBG Mobile beta tester, the PUBG Mobile team has the final say. PUBG Mobile players can apply for beta tester program by filling out a survey form [HERE] and confirming the age. PUBG Mobile beta test form requires players to answer questions like current account level, in-game user ID, highest rank, season and more. Players are also asked which platform they are playing the game in, iOS or Android. If it is the former, then the player must select the iPhone model and in case of Android then the processor must be selected. After filling out the form, when the player hits the submit option, PUBG Mobile team will receive the application. If selected, the player will be contacted via email. PUBG Mobile 0.17.0: Expected features PUBG Mobile 0.17.0 update is a big one and bound to bring several new features, including weapons, maps and more. The upcoming update in the game is expected to bring new features like a lantern to help in day/night mode, drone inside a Super Box to spy on enemies, cold weather, animals such as deer and hen, pain killer dispenser and the ability to throw pan and crowbar. Once we get access to PUBG Mobile beta program, we'll be sure to test it and report our findings. Word of caution Before signing up as a beta tester, players must remember two things. PUBG Mobile beta versions are buggy compared to the stable version. Unless you have a secondary account or keenness to see PUBG Mobile's new features, it's not such a good idea to enrol for the beta. Besides occasional bugs, you won't be able to play with your friends on a lower version of the game. Teaming up as a squad or duo in PUBG Mobile requires all players to be on the same version. But it is likely that players will get a separate beta app for testing, so the regular gameplay won't be affected. Only thing is you'd end up with two PUBG Mobile files on the phone, using up your precious storage.","

475,2019-12-20,16:26:34,technology,games,PUBG Mobile Lite update brings exciting mode we've all been waiting for," Following the success of PUBG Mobile, Tencent Games brought the popular battle-royale title to the masses with the launch of PUBG Mobile Lite. It has been a raging success in India as it caters to the people with budget, low-configuration smartphones. Now, there's something far more exciting in the latest update to the game. PUBG Mobile Lite received an important update, version 0.15.0, which brings an exciting mode we've all been waiting. PUBG Mobile Lite players can enjoy the title's critically-acclaimed 4x4 Team Deathmatch (TDM) mode, which received a lot of praise and engagement in PUBG Mobile. 4x4 TDM in PUBG Mobile Lite PUBG Mobile Lite 0.15.0 update brings the challenging 4x4 TDM mode for its Android users. If you've played or watched the gameplay of TDM, you would know it is all about quick thinking and acting. Unlike in regular matches, players have to come up with new strategies almost instantly to prevent the opposite team from winning. Here's how 4x4 Team Deathmatch works: Players will be divided into two teams and dropped in a tiny warehouse map. Players can choose their weapons like M416, SCAR-L and Kar98 at the spawn point, but there are high-level equipment such as Level Three armor and helmets, M249 light machine guns and RPG-7 rocket launchers strategically placed across the map. This special mode comes with unlimited spawns, but every time you die, the enemy earns a point and inches closer to victory. There's a timer for each match, within which players must beat the opponent's score. There's more… The highlight of PUBG Mobile Lite update is clearly TDM mode, but there's more for its players. For instance, there are new weapons and attachments to make the gameplay exciting. Players get MK47 marksman rifle, which uses 7.62 ammo with 20 rounds, and Skorpion 9mm pistol with 20 rounds. There are two new scopes, 3x and 6x to be equipped on most weapons. Other changes in PUBG Mobile Lite update include new winter-themed in-game skins, advertisement rewards, Arcade Spin event, Lucky Air Drops as a part of Winner Pass, holiday theme for main menu and bug fixes. Players can also see teammate's real-time status during the gameplay to get useful intel during combat.","

Following the success of PlayerUnknown's Battleground, the infamous ""PlayerUnknown"" Brendan Greene decided announced moving to a new role away from PUBG. Now we finally have a clue about what Greene was up to all these months. PUBG Special Projects was formed by Greene, away from PUBG's Seoul studio in Amsterdam, to focus on ""research and game development."" It wasn't clear what this new team was meant for at the time of the announcement in March this year, but we are starting to learn the special team's intentions. Practically nothing much has changed between March and now, except for a mysterious trailer for what appears to be PlayerUnknown's next project called Prologue. The short trailer doesn't give away anything except the scene where the new game would be set. The game's trailer shows a forest setting, rocks, a dirt trail and loud thunder cracks amidst the heavy downpour. Then the camera moves, showing first-person view, to show the forest a bit more. A dog bark is heard in the background and the camera moves sharply, trying to locate its origin. Then a black screen is shown and then credits. The game also has a webpage, playprologue.com, which currently has the trailer and a brief introduction to the project. ""Prologue is an exploration of new technologies and gameplay. Our aim with this game is to give players unique and memorable experiences, each and every time they play,"" reads the website. There's nothing more to go by at this moment, but this could just be a beginning of something fresh for PUBG's Special Projects team and we are finally starting to hear about it.

PUBG Mobile 0.16.0 update is finally here, offering players a plethora of features to intensify the gameplay. PUBG Mobile 0.16.0 update will be rolled out on Wednesday. Unlike previous big updates, the latest one doesn't take the game servers offline, but players would need to update the game in order to invite other players. PUBG Mobile 0.16.0 update release date and download instructions Since the PUBG Mobile 0.16.0 update is a big one, players need to ensure they have up to 2GB storage space freely available. Android users are required to have 1.57GB storage space while iOS users need 1.97GB free space. If the players have installed the older version, they only need to download the update contents, which weigh about 673MB. In any case, downloading such heavy files requires a stable and secure Wi-Fi connection or users might risk losing their daily data allowance. Users can update PUBG Mobile from Play Store and App Store or follow the prompts after launching the game. PUBG Mobile 0.16.0 update: What's new? PUBG Mobile 0.16.0 update brings several improvements and additions to the game. Check out all the things that are new in the update: RageGear TDM This special mode looks like it is inspired by Mad Max: Fury Road and adds refreshing material to the game. RearGear in TDM mode will come with heavily armoured vehicles and players will be assigned as drivers and shooters. In a match between two teams, players need to destroy the enemy and the team to achieve the target and score first wins the match. Classic Mode - Snow Paradise This mode is rather fun and perfectly aligns with the snowy winter season. For those who do not get snow can at least reminisce its beauty in the new mode, which has the Spawn Island covered in snow and players can take cable cars on snowy mountains as well as try out freestyle snowboarding. EvoGround - Loadout This new option lets up choose your weapons and items you wish to bring into the TDM match. Players can enter the Armoury system from the TDM Selection screen, choose their weapons before entering the match or loadout again when respawning. Healing while moving in Classic matches This is a welcoming change. Medical items can now be applied while moving, but the movement speed is reduced while using consumables. This applies to Med Kits, Painkillers, Energy drinks, Bandages, Adrenaline syringes and the rest. Interestingly, bandages can now be used continuously to restore health, saving players those few extra taps. No more nasty tricks It is annoying when your own teammate knocks you out to steal your valuable crates. But there's a new feature in the PUBG Mobile update that restricts players who kill you from looting your Death Crate. Players can also report a teammate for friendly fire to stop them from performing further actions during the current match. Take that for karma! Teaming up, AGAIN! There's a new feature that allows solo players to invite their teammates to play another game. If the invitation is accepted, the teammates will return to the Lobby automatically and team up with the player. Weapons reconfigured Some of your popular PUBG Mobile weapons have been reconfigured, either to cause more damage or less. While damage from a lot of weapons, including SMG, Crossbow, S12K, shotguns, and Bolt action sniper rifles has been increased, AWM's damage is lowered from 132 to 120. A lot of improvements Besides these new changes, PUBG Mobile 0.16.0 update brings several in-game improvements to make the gameplay better. Everything from firearm balancing to offering better vantage point while leaning to the left, and reducing lag in TDM and more can surely add to the advantage of the players. It's important you get the update as soon as it is available, solely for the important changes and improvements it brings on board.","

478,2019-12-06,19:29:58,technology,games,"There's great news for PUBG Mobile players, but there's a catch"," Qualcomm Snapdragon Summit has brought some exciting new updates for smartphone enthusiasts, but there's some great news for mobile gamers as well. During the three-day summit, held in Hawaii, Qualcomm demonstrated PUBG Mobile gameplay, which had a special feature gamers have been waiting for a long time. PUBG Mobile gameplay is intense and engaging. One of its strongest features is the graphics, but of late, rumours about higher refresh rate have got players excited. Currently, PUBG Mobile is limited to 60fps, but it could soon change for much smoother graphics. Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 865 chipset has been upgraded with performance, graphics, power efficiency and more. To demonstrate the capability of Snapdragon 865's chipset, Qualcomm worked with PUBG Mobile developers to offer 90fps support for its gamers. But there's little information available on when PUBG Mobile would get 90fps support. Since Qualcomm made it a point to demonstrate this new upgrade at its summit, PUBG Mobile's 90fps could be exclusive to Snapdragon 865-powered smartphones. Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 offers 20 percent faster graphics performance with Adreno 650 GPU. The chipset supports QHD+ screens at 144Hz refresh rates, which could allow companies and developers to take advantage of faster display panels. 2020 is going to be exciting not just for smartphone enthusiasts, but also to mobile gamers. Even though it is great that PUBG Mobile will finally get 90fps support even at a time when phones have already upgraded to 120Hz refresh rate, players will only be able to get those ultra-smooth graphics with the most expensive phones coming out in a few months. In fact, Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 supporting 144Hz displays means PUBG Mobile at 90fps isn't quite in the trend. In addition to higher refresh rate, Qualcomm said PUBG Mobile will get 10-bit HDR support, which means there will be a wider range of colours for immersive visuals in the game.","

480,2022-03-31,09:41:25,sports,indian-premier-league,IPL: Royal Challengers Bangalore win low-scoring thriller by 3 wickets against Kolkata Knight Riders," In a see-saw, low-scoring thriller in IPL 2022, where bowlers called the shots, Royal Challengers Bangalore defeated Kolkata Knight Riders by three wickets at DY Patil Stadium on Wednesday. After bowling out Kolkata for just 128, Bangalore lost their first three batters in power-play. But critical knocks from Sherfane Rutherford (28), David Willey (18), Shahbaz Ahmed (27), Dinesh Karthik (14 not out) and Harshal Patel (10 not out) took Bangalore home with four balls remaining. Kolkata drew first blood on just the third ball as Umesh Yadav cramped Anuj Rawat for room, leaving the youngster to poke at it and the edge was snapped by the keeper flying to his left. Virat Kohli hit Yadav for sweetly-timed boundaries through cover point and mid-wicket to get going. Faf du Plessis slammed Tim Southee over cover. But on the very next ball, du Plessis closed the bat face too early and the leading edge flew to point. Kolkata's roaring start continued as Kohli flirted with a ball outside the off-stump off Yadav and nicked behind to keeper. Rutherford and Willey revived Bangalore's chase after the early strikes. The duo absorbed the pressure and got boundaries when the ball was there to be hit. The 45-run partnership off 53 balls ended when Willey chipped straight to mid-wicket off Narine. Rutherford got a boundary off Chakravarthy while Ahmed smacked Andre Russell with sixes over deep mid-wicket and deep square leg. Ahmed danced down the pitch to hit Chakravarthy over deep mid-wicket. But on the very next ball, Chakravarthy had the last laugh as Ahmed was beaten by flight and turn to be stumped by the keeper. Rutherford's innings ended when Sheldon Jackson grabbed the inside edge by diving to his right and grabbing it with his right hand off Southee's bowling. Wanindu Hasaranga hit a boundary but miscued loft on the next ball to mid-off. Patel scooped a boundary off Venkatesh Iyer and whipped past long-on while Karthik, who survived a run-out chance, pulled Russell over deep square leg and finished off the chase with a gorgeous straight drive to open Bangalore's account in the points table. Earlier, Kolkata's batting order were the masters of their own downfall. In a quest to hit hard against anything coming their way, they fell while attempting to play extravagant strokes instead of adjusting to the match situation. Bangalore's seamers found the perfect length on a tacky pitch: just short of a good length with extra bounce coming to the fore. Kolkata lost openers Venkatesh Iyer and Ajinkya Rahane in power-play. While Iyer tried to nudge a short of length delivery from Akash Deep to the leg-side, only for the top-edge to be pouched by the bowler running to his left, Rahane mistimed the pull on a short ball from Mohammed Siraj straight to deep square leg. Deep's pacy short ball, with some away nip, claimed Nitish Rana as a miscued heave over leg-side was snapped by Willey running back from backward square leg and making a slide to complete the catch in the final over of power-play. Kolkata's troubles increased as Shreyas Iyer holed out to long-on off Hasaranga. Sunil Narine produced some fireworks by smacking Deep for a four over mid-off and six over keeper's head. But an ugly hook to a straight ball saw Narine miscue to backward point off Hasaranga in the ninth over. On the very next ball, Hasaranga castled Sheldon Jackson with a beautiful googly. Russell, though, had other plans. He began by slog-sweeping Hasaranga over deep mid-wicket. Patel struck on the fourth ball of his night, forcing Sam Billings to hit his slower short of length ball straight to long-on. Russell then punished Ahmed with sixes over deep mid-wicket and long-off. But Patel frustrated Russell with four dot balls and on the fifth ball, the pacer had his man as the big-hitting right-hander tried to hit a short ball outside off-stump through off-side, but got an edge behind to Karthik. Hasaranga scalped his fourth wicket as Southee holed out to long-on. Yadav and Chakravarthy got a couple of boundaries to take Kolkata past 120. Yadav smacked Deep for a six and four before the pacer ended the 27-run stand by uprooting his leg-stump with a yorker. Brief Scores: Kolkata Knight Riders 128 all out in 18.5 overs (Andre Russell 25, Umesh Yadav 18; Wanindu Hasaranga 4/20, Akash Deep 3/45) lost to Royal Challengers Bangalore 132/7 in 19.2 overs (Sherfane Rutherford 28, Shahbaz Ahmed 27; Tim Southee 3/20, Umesh Yadav 2/16) by three wickets. Kolkata Knight Riders' skipper Shreyas Iyer felt extremely proud of his team for taking the match against Royal Challengers Bangalore till the final over. In a low-scoring IPL 2022 thriller, Kolkata tried to defend a paltry score of 128 but were unable to do so despite taking three wickets in first six overs as Bangalore completed the chase with four balls to spare. ""I really found this game exciting. Before getting in, I spoke with my boys and told them that this game is going to define our character and attitude on the field no matter we defend or not. The way we fight it on the ground, that is really going to reflect our mentality in the next few games. I am really proud of the way we played this game and took it till the last over,"" said Iyer after the match. Iyer was appreciative of Bangalore strategising their chase very well. ""It was really tough at that moment because I wanted to get my best bowlers up there and get a few wickets early on but it didn't work out really well. Kudos to their batsmen, they played really well out in the middle. They took out the toughest phase as soon as possible."" Asked on why he handed over 19th over duties to Venkatesh Iyer's part-time pace, Iyer explained, ""In the end, I decided to go with Venky because he's also got really good experience bowling at international level and you need to back them especially at the start of the tournament. It's really important they gain confidence as early as possible and this was one of the best games to get that."" Iyer admitted that Kolkata's batting didn't execute the slam-bang style against Bangalore but vowed to come back stronger in the next match.  Iyer signed off by speaking highly of leg-spinner Wanindu Hasaranga's spell of 4/20.

481,2021-04-12,00:21:48,sports,indian-premier-league,KKR vs SRH IPL 2021 highlights : Kolkata Knight Riders win against Sunrisers Hyderabad by 10 runs," KKR has won its first match of the season against SRH. Kolkata Knight Riders delivered a spectacular performance in their season opener match against Sunrisers Hyderabad. KKR won by 10 runs. Riding on the strong batting supported by good bowling in the power play and towards the end, KKR gave a sneak peek into their much balanced side in comparison to the last season. What makes this win even more special is that this was KKR's 100th win in IPL across all the seasons. Highlights After the early dismissal of Shubman Gill; Nitish Rana and Rahul Tripathi displayed some attacking cricket and laid the foundation for a 200 plus score. Owing to this partnership, despite late stutter and wickets falling in heap in the last few overs, KKR ended up with a formidable 187 on the board. The Chennai wicket appeared to be two paced since the beginning of the inning but the dew factor was expected to negate this effect in the second inning. Scoreboard In the second inning, KKR started strongly by keeping the runs under check and also accounting for two early wickets including that of David Warner. David Warner was given a respite in the first over itself when Harbhajan Singh, playing his first match in KKR colours, induced a false drive which ended up in Warner playing it in the air towards Pat Cummins. Cummins, running in from the point area, failed to hold onto the chance. But, this did not cost KKR much as Prasidh Krishna bowled a snorter which made edge to the safe hands of Dinesh Karthik. After the power play, Bairstow and Manish Pandey stitched a good partnership and kept SRH in the contention for victory. Later in the inning, after Bairstow's dismissal off Pat Cummins, the pace of the innings slowed down. The run rate mounted beyond 12 per over. Manish Pandey held one end intact scoring runs at a good pace but kept on losing his partners at the other end. Good last overs from the KKR pacers closed the deal.","

482,2021-04-10,13:58:06,sports,indian-premier-league,RCB beat MI IPL 2021: How did the trends fare at IPL opener [Detailed]," Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) beat Mumbai Indians (MI) by two wickets in the opening match of IPL 2021. Played at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, the match remained a complete thriller till the last ball. Let's take a look at the trends and the predictions and how did it fare. Mumbai Indians loses first IPL match again Continuing their tradition of losing the first match of every IPL since 2013, Mumbai Indians' didn't surprise us this time either. Despite a thrilling finish at the end, RCB came on the top and defeated Mumbai by 2 wickets. Ever since 2013, Mumbai Indians' have been losing their first league match of every IPL. The Chidambaram factor MA Chidambaran has off-late been a happy hunting ground for Mumbai. The MI won their last five matches being played on this ground. And the other hand, the ground had always been a difficult venue for Royal Challengers Bangalore. RCB had set a record of losing back-to-back all the last five matches they played on this ground. Glenn Maxwell Glenn Maxwell has always been an enigma with the bundle-of-talent that he is. However, the Australian cricketer doesn't always translate his cricketing prowess into his performance on the field. Despite playing his first IPL for Delhi in 2012, and since then playing for Mumbai, Punjab and Delhi; the only IPL season where he managed to set the stage on fire was in 2014. In 2014, Maxwell's all-round performance for Punjab took KXIP to the finals which happen to be their only appearance in IPL finals. For the last few seasons, Glenn Maxwell's batting performance deteriorated severely. So much so that Virender Sehwag went on to call him a ""ten crore cheerleader"". However, despite the criticisms coming his way, Maxwell was bought at an astronomical amount of Rs 14.25 crores by RCB. And by teaming up with RCB, he went on to break his own dry spell of not hitting a six for 1079 days in yesterday's match. His humongous 100-m six surprised even the likes of Virat Kohli.","

483,2021-04-10,01:05:03,sports,indian-premier-league,RCB vs MI IPL 2021 highlights: Royal Challengers Bangalore pull off last ball thriller against Mumbai Indians," Seamer Harshal Patel's five-wicket haul (5/27) helped Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) beat Mumbai Indians (MI) by two wickets in a last ball thriller in the opening match of the 2021 Indian Premier League (IPL) season at the MA Chidambaram Stadium here on Friday. Patel ran through MI's middle and lower order to restrict them to 159/9 after they were cruising at 86/1 midway through their innings. RCB were then powered by a 27-ball 48 from AB de Villiers and a 28-ball 39 from Glenn Maxwell even as they made heavy weather of the chase, winning it off the last ball of the match even though they had been set up well by a 52-run third-wicket stand between skipper Virat Kohli (33 off 29) and Maxwell. Earlier, after MI looked set for a big total halfway through their innings, RCB pulled back by getting rid of Suryakumar Yadav (31 off 23) and Chris Lynn (49 off 35) in quick succession. Patel, the right-arm pacer who plays for Haryana in domestic cricket, then ran through the middle-order. He got rid of dangerous hitters Ishan Kishan, Hardik Pandya, Kieron Pollard and Krunal Pandya, besides dismissing tail-ender Marco Jansen to put the brakes on a strong MI batting line-up. RCB vs MI MI batsman Yadav looked set for a big score, but RCB's new recruit Kyle Jamieson forced an edge off his bat that was neatly collected by de Villiers behind the stumps. Washington Sundar then caught Lynn off his own bowling, as he looked to go for a big hit but instead lobbed it high in the air, as MI slid to 105/3 in 12.5 overs. There were still 43 balls left and MI had their power-hitters in the dugout. However, Patel got into the act and ran through the middle and lower order. He deceived Hardik Pandya with a slow full toss, got Ishan Kishan with a yorker, had Krunal Pandya caught at deep mid-wicket and then also had Kieron Pollard caught in the deep. He then bowled IPL debutant South African Marco Jansen to complete a fifer. RCB got off to a flier -- scoring 36 runs in just four overs -- before two quick wickets of opener Washington Sundar and newcomer Rajat Patidar pegged them back. Kohli and Maxwell then took their team to safety but four wickets for 24 runs in the space of four overs saw them struggling at 122/6 in the 17th over. De Villiers then went after the bowling to take them close before he was run out. MI sensed a chance but with just two needed off two balls, they had left it too late. Brief scores: Mumbai Indians 159/9 in 20 overs (C Lynn 49, S Yadav 31, I Kishan 28, H Patel 5/27) vs Royal Challengers Bangalore 160/8 in 20 overs (AB de Villiers 48, G Maxwell 39, V Kohli 33, J Bumrah 2/26, M Jansen 2/28).

484,2020-10-17,01:29:15,sports,indian-premier-league,Dominant MI can't take the foot off the pedal: Rohit," Mumbai Indians skipper Rohit Sharma said that the team is staying guarded against complacency after a facile eight-wicket win over Kolkata Knight Riders on Friday that helped them go back to the top of the table. MI have won every match they have played since losing to Royal Challengers Bangalore in a Super Over on September 28. The matches have mostly been one-sided affairs with them winning by 48 runs against Kings XI Punjab, 34 runs against Sunrisers Hyderabad, 57 runs against Rajasthan Royals and five wickets against the Delhi Capitals who they replaced at the top of the table on Friday when they chased down the target of 149 set by KKR with more than three overs to spare. ""It is important for us to make sure we stay on the money. It is important to not be complacent. This tournament is very funny, can't take the foot off the pedal at any time, we have seen how teams lose at times,"" said Rohit in the post-match presentation ceremony. ""The guys are very hungry, they haven't played cricket for six months and they want to come out here and express themselves. Guys like Krunal (Pandya) or Ishan (Kishan) have not gotten many chances and these guys are very hungry and they want to prove a point."" On Friday, MI restricted KKR to 148/5 before chasing down the target with ease. ""We were clinical with both bat and ball, the expected performance was there. Its always a challenge when you have won four out of four, how you turn up on that particular day. I thought we turned up very well, right from the start,"" he said. ""It's special to chase and win, gives us a lot of confidence. The trend in the first half of the tournament has been that teams chasing have lost games but I guess its changing now. Teams batting second will miss of the games in the second half I feel.""","

485,2020-10-16,05:28:00,sports,indian-premier-league,Need for speed: 16 bowlers exceeded 150.7 kmph 100 times in IPL; see list," Sixteen speedsters have bowled deliveries measuring between 150.7 kmph and 156.22 kmph 100 times in the Indian Premier League (IPL) since its inception in 2008, with Delhi Capitals' (DC) Anrich Nortje bowling the fastest ball in the tournament history on Wednesday against Rajasthan Royals (RR). The official IPL website, www.iplt20.com, displays only the top 100 instances when speed merchants have exceeded 150.7 kmph. South African Nortje exceeded 150 kmph mark four times in an over on Wednesday, with his fastest ball being clocked 156.2 kmph. Apart from Nortje, the other 15 bowlers who qualify for this list are: Dale Steyn, Kasigo Rabada, Pat Cummins, Shaun Tait, Jofra Archer, Navdeep Saini, Lasith Malinga, Lockie Ferguson, Umesh Yadav, Billy Stanlake, Ishant Sharma, Morne Morkel, Mitchell Johnson, Parvinder Awana, and Veer Pratap Singh. Nortje set the speed guns spinning during his fiery opening spell against RR at the Dubai International Stadium on Wednesday. Such was the pace he generated in his first two overs of the day that he relegated Steyn's eight-year old record for fastest ball (154.40 kmph) to number four on the list, taking the top three spots for himself in three consecutive deliveries. Nortje sent in the fifth ball of his first over at 156.22 kmph, thus surpassing the 154.40 kmph delivery that Steyn had bowled for Deccan Chargers in 2012 and thus becoming the fastest in the history of the tournament. While that was incredibly ramped fine for four by RR's Jos Buttler, the England batsman found himself castled on the next ball timed 155.1 kmph, the second fastest ball of all time in the IPL. The South African then sent the first ball of his next over at 154.74 kmph which became the third fastest of all time in the IPL. This is Nortje's first season in the IPL and he has clocked 150 kmph or more 12 times already. Nortje's DC and South Africa teammate Rabada also crossed 150 kmph in the same match once and that was the first time he did so this season. However, it was only an addition to the two times he had done so for DC in 2017 and to the 24 times he had surpassed 150 kmph in 2019. Jofra Archer has been the leading RR's impressive bowling performances that have not quite been matched up by their batsmen this season. Archer has surpassed 150 kmph 15 times this season alone, three more than what Nortje has managed thus far. Kolkata Knight Riders' (KKR) Pat Cummins crossed 150 kmph once this season and is yet to touch or cross the 153.56 kmph he clocked for Delhi Daredevils in 2017. Australia's Tait was dubbed ""The Wild Thing"" at his peak for the searing pace he used to bowl at before injuries hampered his progress. He figures eight times in the list of 100 fastest balls in IPL history on the tournament's official website, with the fastest being 153.43 kmph for RR. Veteran Mumbai Indians fast bowler Malinga is known for his relentless accuracy while bowling yorkers. He has, however, crossed 150 kmph only twice for the four-time champions, according to www.iplt20.com Saini and Yadav are the only two Indians to feature in the top 10 fastest bowlers in the tournament. Saini is yet to do so this season for Royal Challengers Bangalore but did so 14 times last season. Yadav has done it four times -- twice for RCB and thrice for Delhi Daredevils. New Zealand's Lockie Ferguson is yet to feature for KKR this season. He has surpassed 150 kmph thrice for KKR and once for the erstwhile Rising Pune Supergiant. (With inputs from IANS)","

Kohli's Royal Challengers Bangalore is set to open their IPL 13 campaign against SunRisers Hyderabad at the Dubai International Stadium on Monday evening. Scott Styris on Kohli during IPL The 31-year-old batsman last played for India against New Zealand in the Test series in February. The team was scheduled to face South Africa in the ODIs in March but that had to be postponed following the outbreak of novel coronavirus. ""Well, I don't think he (Kohli) will struggle. The reason for that is he is an all-time great player and he's the best batsman in the IPL over the years. So, if he's going to struggle then everybody is going to struggle,"" Styris said while speaking on Star Sports show Game Plan. ""I have no doubt that he is ready to go, like everybody. He will look to get off to a fast start in the tournament just to ease their own nerves. The confidence gets up and then they can go about playing. But I don't think it's going be a problem. He is just far too good for that,"" he added. Speaking about the game, the former Black Caps all-rounder said that he doesn't see Kane Williamson finding a spot in the playing XI for the Hyderabad-based franchise. ""Kane Williamson sits out, I know he is the orange cap holder two years ago when (David)Warner was serving his suspension for the year, but I just think with the balance of that side, they have got a proven Warner. ""He, along with Kohli, have been the two-best batsman in this competition for many years now. His leadership is terrific. I think he really buys into as well the culture and the group of SRH. So, I think (Jonny) Bairstow's performance last year and the relationship he has with Warner at the top. They just seem to gel and sink nicely,"" he said. The 45-year-old further opined that Afghanistan's Rashid Khan and Mohammad Nabi will occupy the remaining two foreign players spot in the SRH XI.","

The 13th edition of the tournament will be played across three bio-secure venues in the (UAE) -- Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Sharjah -- with the opening game pitting defending champions Mumbai Indians against last year's runners-up Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in Abu Dhabi. Ricky Ponting on the early stages of IPL Slow bowlers and spinners have been widely expected to take centre stage due to the conditions traditionally on offer in the UAE. And Ponting expects the wickets to slow down as the tournament goes on. ""I think the conditions might change quite a bit through the tournament with only three venues being used,"" Ponting said in a virtual press conference. ""Here in Dubai, we have 24 games. Speaking to the groundsman the other day, he has only four wickets that he can use so he's going to have five or more games on each pitch. So, we trained at the main ground a couple of days ago, there was a lot of green grass on the wicket. But I think by the time the game comes around tomorrow, there might be a little bit of that grass cut out,"" he said. ""But I think in the initial bit of the tournament, we'll see the seam bowlers having an impact but as the tournament goes on the wickets will slow down and probably start to spin a lot more,"" he felt. Ponting, however, said that the team would get a better idea of the conditions only when they start playing. DC's first match is against Kings XI Punjab on Sunday. ""That's been our reading of the conditions so far, but we'll get a better idea once we get to the ground tomorrow. But I'm expecting that certainly in the first part there won't be a lot of spin on offer, certainly in Dubai, anyway,"" he said.","

493,2020-09-19,19:07:11,sports,indian-premier-league,IPL 13: Here's what fans can look forward to from CSK and Dhoni," The 2020 edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) is all set for a blockbuster opening with defending champions Mumbai Indians resuming their long-standing fabled rivalry with seasoned favourites Chennai Super Kings on Saturday evening at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium. Both sides have played a total of 29 matches against each other, but MI have dominated the head-to-head record with 17 wins. More than an 'El Clasico of IPL', fans are eagerly awaiting the return of MS Dhoni, who returns after an year. Three titles, eight appearances in the finals and a staggering 100 per cent qualification record to the tournament play-offs -- CSK's overall record in the IPL has been phenomenal. Ahead of the tournament opener which airs on the Star Sports network and Disney+ Hotstar, CSK would be keen to avenge their 2019 IPL final loss against the Rohit Sharma-led brigade. Following are the things which fans can look forward to from CSK in this IPL season: Dhoni's grand comeback Dhoni and Chennai Super Kings have been synonymous to each other in the IPL, forming a relationship unlike no other in franchise cricket. The veteran leader's contribution to CSK has been no less than heroic, with 871 runs at average of 79.18 during the last two seasons. Dhoni, who announced his international retirement on Independence Day this year, has not played competitive cricket since India's semi-final exit against New Zealand at the 2019 World Cup. So, Dhoni would surely be the cynosure of all eyes. CSK's mighty spin attack Since his debut as a captain in 2007, Dhoni has heavily relied on spinners. This time too, CSK head into the 2020 edition of the IPL with a strong spin bowling unit. With the likes of Mitchell Santner, Piyush Chawla, Ravindra Jadeja, Imran Tahir and Karn Sharma in their ranks, CSK can be a real threat considering the dry surfaces of the UAE. The surfaces of the Chepauk and Abu Dhabi/Dubai are expected to be similar in many ways and teams can expect a whirlwind of spin during the tournament. Records Dhoni can smash in IPL 13 As Dhoni returns to the playing field, with the wicketkeeper's gloves, there are a few records which he could break in the tournament: The CSK captain currently tops the charts for most dismissals in the IPL. But he can go a step further. Dhoni, with 133 dismissals to his name, needs 17 more to reach the landmark of 150 dismissals. The 39-year-old can look at breaking the record for the most dismissals in a single season. With 24 dismissals in 16 matches during IPL 12, the record is currently held by Delhi Capitals' Rishabh Pant. Going by news about Dhoni's form with word from the camp suggesting that he is sharp and fit, this should be a cakewalk for the three-time IPL champion.","

Scott Styris on adjustment to playing without crowds ""I don't think there will be too much of an adjustment for the overseas players. A lot of the overseas players play in front of small crowds or even empty grounds on a regular basis, so they will be used to that,"" said Styris while speaking on Star Sports show Cricket Connected show. ""But you are right, Indian players, I can't remember. I mean (Virat) Kohli, 10 years ago, most of those players have been around long enough now.

The IPL was moved to the UAE due to rising COVID-19 cases in India. The cities of Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah -- which will host the league -- are expected to experience temperatures of around 35-40 degree celsius during the tournament. Mohammad Shami on UAE temperatures ""Temperature is much higher compared to India. There are chances of getting dehydrated. There will be chances of cramps. So we will have to keep those things in mind,"" Shami told IANS in an interview from Dubai on Tuesday. ""It will be difficult as the wickets here are also different. So workload management is important. But it is not that difficult that it can't be managed. It depends on us how we manage our workload,"" added the 30-year-old, rated as one of the best pacers in the World at the moment. ""It felt great getting out of home and coming to Dubai. We are all grateful to play the game which we all love. So the feeling cannot be compared. The best part is that everyone is on the field and training. In India, IPL should bring smiles to the faces of all,"" he said. Shami will lead the pace attack for the KL Rahul-led side, which is yet to win the IPL trophy. Asked if there will be added pressure on his shoulders, Shami said, ""I don't take pressure of being a senior in the side. You should believe in your skill and back yourself. ""I always try to share my knowledge with all my teammates at any level. It can be IPL, while playing for India or even at the club level. I like to talk about the team rather than myself."" Shami will once again share the dressing room with Chris Gayle. Quizzed about how a bowler should approach players like Gayle and Andre Russell, he said, ""There is no batsman in the game against whom you cannot plan. You have to plan. I have played against Gayle. It is not possible that a batsman does not have weakness."" A veteran of 49 Tests, 77 One-Day Internationals and 11 T20s, Shami has been in top form in the recent past. Further asked if he has set a goal for himself, he said, ""I don't believe in any goal. I believe in performing according to the demand of the situation. I always try to do better than what I am doing. ""Always try to better myself. I tell coaches also, I don't have a goal. I like to perform as per the role given to me and to the best of my ability."" India are slated to travel to Australia for a T20 and four-Test series later this year. The Virat Kohli side scripted a historic series win in Australia in 2018-19 but the hosts did not have Steve Smith and David Warner, who were suspended for the ball tampering incident. This time though, the star pair would be there. ""We have beaten them before. You cannot say somebody was not there so it was easier and all that,"" Shami said. ""Now we can also think, if we had this bowler, it would have been good and so on. As per situation and current form, you need to plan. That matters more. If you compare both teams, they are strong. It matters how well you execute at the end of the day,"" he signed off.","

497,2020-09-02,04:12:00,sports,indian-premier-league,BCCI seeks leeway in COVID protocols from three UAE govts for IPL," Strict COVID-19 protocols in Abu Dhabi, one of the three emirates scheduled to host the IPL matches from September 19, has hamstrung the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). The world's wealthiest cricket board is currently in talks with the governments of the emirates, desperately seeking concessions. And because of the COVID-related problems in organising the 13th edition of the IPL, the BCCI has not only not announced the schedule of matches, but has also not shared its plans with the eight franchises. BCCI hasn't shared the schedule yet ""The BCCI hasn't told the franchises anything yet about the IPL schedule. But for us franchises the IPL is on as of today, because if the IPL was not to happen this year the BCCI would have told us much earlier. The franchises have spent a lot of money on their teams. Positive cases will continue to emerge,"" a source in a franchise told IANS from the UAE. ""The point is that if the BCCI has to cancel the IPL they need to cancel it today. They can't cancel it after 15 days. The franchises are here in the UAE and have spent so much money on their teams. Also, when we have called our players for the IPL, we will have to pay them as well. In the event of a cancellation, we can't tell the players that since you didn't play matches we wouldn't pay you. All that will have to be taken into consideration. Presently, BCCI officials are talking to the local governments of Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Sharjah,"" the franchise official informed. Indian Premier League Governing Council chairman Brijesh Patel and interim BCCI CEO Hemang Amin are in the UAE and are in talks with the three emirates governments to seek some concessions in the strict COVID protocols for the IPL and then chalk out a workable plan. Another source said if one is going from Dubai to Abu Dhabi COVID-testing is done at the border and it takes up to two-and-a-half hours. Alternately, one has to produce a certificate of a negative result of a test done within the last 48 hours. ""But you do not expect the likes of Dhoni and Kohli to stand in the queue for that long. So, BCCI is trying to get permission to do COVID tests on IPL squad members in their hotels,"" he said. At the same time, all franchises have become extra cautious after thirteen Chennai Super Kings (CSK) members, including two players, tested COVID-19 positive in the UAE. Players and coaching staff come out of their hotel rooms only for practice/training/yoga sessions and for some recreational activities that a few franchises, like Mumbai Indians, have created. But breakfast, lunch and dinner are being served in their rooms. All that is being done within the established local COVID protocols. ""We are taking all the precautions after the CSK episode. Initially, we had thought that we would take the team out for a few team dinners sometime during the tournament. But that plan has been shelved. Now, it is only bubble, and bubble, and bubble. All meals are being served in the squad members' rooms; it's only room service now,"" a franchise official said. Abu Dhabi has the strictest protocols of the three emirates where the IPL is to be played. It has virtually sealed all its entry-exit points, and is allowing people to enter only after they furnish proof of their negative COVID-19 test results. The opening match of the IPL, between champions Mumbai Indians and runners-up CSK, is expected to be played in Abu Dhabi on September 19. If all the pieces do not fall into place by that time, then the BCCI would have to make further changes in plans, and maybe cancel the Abu Dhabi leg altogether. The delay in the announcement of the IPL schedule has prevented STAR India, the official broadcaster, from finalising their plans for the coverage. It was planned that separate crews would be stationed in each of the three emirates, due to the pandemic, to cover the matches. Meanwhile, one person who would have been part of STAR's production team has tested positive in India and has been grounded. All in all, the situation on all fronts is fluid, and everyone is keeping his fingers crossed.","

Madan Lal on following the COVID-19 protocol Speaking to IANS, Madan Lal said that no cricketer should, even by accident, break the COVID-19 protocol in the UAE, where the IPL starts on September 19. ""There are challenging days ahead for the cricketers. It will be their toughest IPL as they can't roam outside, explore the place to relax their mind.

""What I got to know is that in the first 15 days there will be no crowd but the ECB (Emirates Cricket Board) may relax the rules later, depending on the number of Covid cases there.

On the issue of 'Mankading', when the non-striking batsman is run out by a bowler on finding him out of the crease before bowling a delivery, the former India all-rounder supported Ravichandran Ashwin's stand. He said that he didn't see a problem as Ashwin has done it a couple of times but he did it within the laws of the game. Madan Lal, however, suggested that the spinner should warn the non-striker about it before 'Mankading'. ""It's within the laws of the game and that's pretty clear. So, I don't have a problem with someone doing it. Ashwin is well within his rights to do what he did earlier (getting Jos Buttler out in 2019 IPL). However, personally, I would prefer it if somebody warns the batsman first,"" said the 69-year-old World Cup winner. Meanwhile, Delhi Capitals coach Ricky Ponting has virtually barred Ashwin from 'Mankading' in the IPL 2020 season, calling the act against the spirit of the game. The former Australia captain's comments triggered a huge debate among fans and former players. Ponting has suggested that he would have a chat with Ashwin on the matter as soon as he reaches the UAE.

It had acquired debt-ridden Ruchi Soya in a corporate insolvency resolution process for around Rs 4,350 crore after competing with Adani Group. Patanjali Ayurved's revenue stands at Rs 8,329 crore as on FY 2018-19. Although the company's overall turnover was much higher since Patanjali Ayurved mainly depends on its FMCG business and its Ayurvedic medicines. Tijarawala revealed to PTI that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is coming with the expression of interest on Monday and it has to submit its proposal by August 14. Last week, BCCI and Vivo decided to suspend their partnership for the 2020 IPL beginning on September 19, in the UAE, amid clamour to boycott Chinese products in the wake of the Sino-India border stand-off. The title sponsorship is a significant part of the IPL's commercial revenue, half of which is shared equally by the franchises it is reported. Vivo had scored the IPL title sponsorship rights for five years from 2018 to 2022 for a reported sum of Rs 2,190 crore, approximately Rs 440 crore per annum. (With inputs from PTI)","

503,2020-08-07,03:19:08,sports,indian-premier-league,IPL 13: BCCI to invite tender for title sponsorship after Vivo's suspension," Following the official confirmation regarding Vivo's exit as title sponsors for the 13th edition of the Indian Premier League, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) will now invite bids through a tender process for IPL 2020 in the next few days. Speaking to IANS, sources in the know of developments said that the BCCI will follow due diligence and transparency while recruiting a new title sponsor for IPL 13. BCCI to issue an Invitation to Bid soon ""BCCI will come out with the ITB soon. Tender process will be followed as the board believes in transparency,"" the source said. Under the Invitation to Bid (ITB), the winning bidder will be granted title sponsorship rights for this year's IPL season set to be played in the UAE from September 19 to November 10. Earlier on Thursday, BCCI decided to officially announce the suspension of the partnership with title sponsors Vivo. The move comes after the BCCI and the IPL Governing Council were both criticised for retaining Vivo as the title sponsor amid raging anti-China sentiment. The government has already banned 59 Chinese mobile apps, placed stringent restrictions on Chinese investments, and is reviewing the partnerships Indian educational institutions have with Chinese counterparts. All this development took place in the backdrop of tensions between the two countries along the LAC in Ladakh where a scuffle between the two armies resulted in the death of 20 Indian soldiers in June. Earlier on Monday, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), which is spearheading a movement for a boycott of Chinese goods, had also criticised BCCI's decision to retain VIVO, the Chinese company, as IPL's title sponsor.","

504,2020-02-16,08:22:02,sports,indian-premier-league,Check out IPL 2020 schedule; Another power-packed season kicks off with rematch of last year's final," The wait is going to be over for millions of cricket fans around the world on Sunday, March 29 as the new season of Indian Premier League (IPL) kicks off, and that too in grand style. There will be a rematch from last year's heart-stopping final between Mumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings and it will be played in Mumbai. The former side had won the match by a solitary run. But that's just the beginning. What follows are 55 more league round matches played across the home grounds of all the home teams concluding with the last game of this stage on May 17 that will feature Royal Challengers Bangalore taking on Mumbai Indians on their home ground. Then, we would move on to the play-offs stage but the itinerary for that is yet to be decided. What's interesting about this season is the fact that there will be just one match played on Saturday during the course of the tournament, unlike previous seasons when the day used to have double-headers. Only Sunday will see two matches taking place. As far as the venues are concerned, the only non-major town to, possibly, host a match or more would be Guwahati as it has been chosen by the Rajasthan Royals to be their alternate home venue. All the other teams have decided to play their home games in the traditional bastions of India cricket such as Mohali, Bengaluru, Mumbai, etc. The possibility of starting the matches half-an-hour early, at 7:30 PM instead of 8 PM has been discussed but the governing council of the tournament has decided against it. After Mumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings kick-off the action, the focus would shift to the national capital where Delhi Capitals and Kings XI Punjab will begin their season. On day 3, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kolkata Knight Riders will be in action at the Chinnaswamy Stadium, the hometown of RCB. Sunrisers Hyderabad will play their first match on day 4 at their home ground, against the defending champions. The last team to start their campaign would be Rajasthan Royals the next day against CSK in Chennai. Mumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings might again start as favourites. The reigning champions still have the great duo of Lasith Malinga and Jasprit Bumrah to lead their pace attack while the consistency of CSK, under the leadership of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, will favour them. However, with the vagaries of T20 format, anything can happen.","

505,2019-05-14,12:10:58,sports,indian-premier-league,Shane Watson's blood-stained trousers during IPL Final draws admiration of fans," Shane Watson almost pushed his team, Chennai Super Kings, over the line in the IPL Final against Mumbai Indians. While he may have fallen just short of victory in the game, his effort has garnered praise from all quarters. What makes his innings even more admirable was that he suffered an wound in his leg which caused bleeding and had to be sewed up with six stitches after the end of the match. Photograph of the CSK batsman showing his trousers stained with blood around the knee area is being viewed and commented upon on social media. Fans and cricketers alike are expressing their praise for the Australian's commitment as well as dedication to his team's cause. The injury resulting in the bleeding occurred when Watson put in a desperate dive to make his ground during the early part of his innings. Despite being dropped three times in the match, the retired Test cricketer kept going and seemed to have sealed the game for his team by hitting three sixes in the 18th over of the innings bowled, inexplicably, by Krunal Pandya. Eventually, the right-hander was dismissed on 80 in the last over of the match. With his wicket, Mumbai's chances increased and thanks to some clever bowling by Lasith Malinga, the Rohit Sharma-led team were able to render Watson's resistance futile. It was a mixed season for the member of the 2015 Australian World Cup winning squad. He had problems with his form but then found it towards the end of the season. It was he who led his team to victory in the last year's Final against Sunrisers Hyderabad with a superb knock in the Final of that edition. The most profuse in praise was Watson's Super Kings teammate Harbhajan Singh. The former off-spinner wrote: ""Can you guys see the blood on his knee. He got 6 stitches after the game ... got injured while diving but continue to bat without telling anyone. That's our @srwatson33. Almost pulled it (off) for us last night."" It certainly was a gutsy innings but one which, unfortunately, ended up on the losing side.","

506,2019-05-13,13:15:33,sports,indian-premier-league,"MS Dhoni was given out rightly, here is why"," The Indian Premier League (IPL) Final turned out as just the type of classic it was expected to be. Mumbai Indians led by Rohit Sharma found a way to defend just nine runs in the last over of the innings and secured their fourth title. But the biggest talking point that emerged from the match was not the individual brilliance of any one player but the decision of the third umpire to give Mahendra Singh Dhoni run out at a crucial stage of the game. There is an intense debate on social media about whether Dhoni's bat was behind the line when the bails were dislodged or not. The problem with making the decision was the fact that one angle showed the former India captain clearly not having his bat behind the line when the bails get dislodged while the other was blocked by a fielder. After deliberating for a long time, the TV umpire eventually decided that Dhoni was out. This wicket, arguably, turned the match in MI's favour.  Many CSK fans have argued that the bails need to be completely dislodged before the batsman makes the crease for him to be run out, and since the bails were only partially removed from the stumps at the when MSD was short of his ground, the umpire should have adjudged him not out. So, was Dhoni really out? Or, was he wrongly adjudged dismissed? Let's look at the rules first. The MCC Law on run out (38.1) says, ""Either batsman is out Run out, except as in 38.2, if, at any time while the ball is in play, he/she is out of his/her ground and his/her wicket is fairly put down by the action of a fielder even though No ball has been called, except in the circumstances of 38.2.2.2, and whether or not a run is being attempted."" So, the key words there are ""wicket is fairly put down."" However, this seemed too vague, so the ICC which can frame the rules of the game, decided to make things clearer. The rules state that the bails have to be 'broken' before the batsman grounds his bat behind the crease to achieve a run out. So, bails being broken is important. Some people have a misconception that the bails need to be completely removed from the stumps. But if one has been watching cricket over the years, he would realise that umpires mainly look at when the bails are disturbed and not necessarily when they are completely detached. One of the angles of Dhoni's run out clearly shows that his bat was short of the crease when the bails were lifted. This, by the standards of cricket, is sufficient for them to be considered broken. So, it is clear, Dhoni was out and CSK fans cannot crib about it. Let's give credit to both teams for putting up a great show and hope that similar excitement awaits us in the World Cup as well.","

507,2019-05-12,23:44:31,sports,indian-premier-league,Breaking: Lasith Malinga redeems himself after Rohit Sharma's brain explosion to give Mumbai Indians fourth IPL title," When the two best teams in the IPL met for the title in the grand finale, it was bound to be a thriller and that's what it turned out to be. In a match that tested the fortitude of the weak-hearted, the decision of Rohit Sharma to give the ball to Krunal Pandya against a well set Shane Watson seemed to be the decisive move. In what would be considered one of the biggest blunders in the history of the league, the Mumbai Indians captain ignored Hardik Pandya who had just bowled one over at that time and instead gave the ball to his spin-bowling brother for the crucial 18th over. The result was 20 runs, almost all hit by the retired Aussie. But it's not just Rohit and Krunal are to blame. Watson offered three chances to the Mumbai team but they dropped all of them. If Watson had been removed earlier, things might have turned out in a completely different manner. Despite Bumrah conceding just 5 runs off the first five balls of the next over, four byes off the last ball brought the game within CSK's reach. The last over went to Malinga, whose previous one had already been taken for plenty of runs. This meant that Hardik ended up bowling just one over in the entire match – conceding just  three in that. But Malinga, who seems to be well past his prime redeemed himself with a brilliant over that sealed the fourth title for the Rohit Sharma-led side. It was truly a final to remember. As expected Twitter exploded with reactions. Here is a snapshot. YESSSSSSsSSS !!!!! ?????????? I am literally Screaming like a monster... 4th Title.. BEST TEAM EVER. !

508,2019-05-07,14:16:31,sports,indian-premier-league,"Umpire Nigel Llong kicked and broke a door after arguing with Virat Kohli over no-ball call, pays for repair"," Umpires have gained a lot of unwanted attention in this season of IPL. The latest incident bringing players into dispute with the officials was the dubious call of no-ball by umpire Nigel Llong during the match between Royal Challengers Bangalore and Sunrisers Hyderabad on May 4. But the reaction of the umpire to the entire episode left its mark in the form of a damaged door, for which the English umpire is going to pay damages. The whole controversy erupted when Umesh Yadav was bowling the last over of Sunrisers' innings. After the call of no-ball had been made, the replays on the big screen showed that it was an error from the official. This led to heated conversations between RCB captain Virat Kohli and Llong with Umesh Yadav joining in. After the innings concluded, it has come to light, the ICC Elite Panel official kicked the door of the umpire's room while walking in. The Englishman will now have to pay for the repair of the door to the authorities of M Chinnaswamy stadium in Bangalore. It must be remembered that this is the second time Virat Kohli felt hard done by an umpire's howler. Earlier in the season, when the Bengaluru-based team was playing against Mumbai Indians, Lasith Malinga bowled a no-ball on the last delivery of the match with RCB needing 7 to win. But the umpires didn't notice it and the match concluded with victory to MI. When the umpiring mistake was pointed out in replays, Kohli articulated his disappointment without any reservations. There was also the infamous episode of MS Dhoni walking out on to the field even after being dismissed to argue with umpires over a contested decision. But the fine is not where the troubles for umpire Llong would end. As per a PTI report, he may face a BCCI enquiry also for his conduct. The Englishmen is scheduled to officiate in the Final of the league slated to take place at Hyderabad on May 12. This is not the first time that the 50-year old official has found himself accused of having made a bad decision. During Sachin Tendulkar's farewell series against West Indies in 2013, he had given the Little Master out, leg before wicket, in the first innings of the first Test at Kolkata. Many thought that the decision was wrong and he was even booed by the crowd during the presentation ceremony on conclusion of the series. However, the same umpire also stopped Steve Smith from asking for a review after he had received a signal from the team dressing-room during Australia's tour to India in 2017. Sometimes, it's useful to remember that umpires are humans too, like players. If the latter are allowed to make mistakes, so should be the former.","

As the pressure started building up, Russell walked out to the ground to bat at number 5 and gave away his wicket to Lasith Malinga for a duck. From their on, there was no saving the KKR team which got restricted to 133 by the Mumbai Indians. As a result, KKR lost the one and only chance of qualifying into the playoffs to compete for the winning trophy in the ongoing IPL T20 tournament. KKR's sluggish knock left thousands of fans heartbroken including Russell's wife Jassym Lora who has been accompanying her husband at the cricket grounds to cheer for him and his IPL team. Bidding an emotional adieu to KKR, Jassym posted a picture of KKR logo in her Instagram story which was drawn on the floor with rangoli with a broken heart emoji.

After KKR's win over MI at the Eden Gardens in the previous match, Jassym had a special interaction with Russell in the post match ceremony. Russell said that whenever he walks inside the ground, his aim is to impress his wife with his batting skills. When Jassym affectionately asked Russell if he considers his beautiful wife as a lucky charm, the loving husband, who couldn't stop blushing, replied, ""Yes. Of course"" filling Jassym's heart with immense happiness. And now that KKR has been knocked out of the IPL season, Jassym won't be able to see her husband Russell hitting the ball out of the ground to impress her.","

At that time, Raai was the brand ambassador of the IPL team Chennai Super Kings (CSK) which was captained by MS Dhoni in 2008. It was being said that Dhoni and Raai had hit it off instantly during the actress' tenure in the team but things didn't work out between them and the two went separate ways within a year. After breaking up with Raai, Dhoni found love again in his childhood friend Sakshi Rawat and they began dating in the same year. The two got married on July 4, 2010 after keeping their love affair a secret. The couple has a daughter named Ziva who was born on February 6, 2015. Even Raai moved on in life and went on to have three or four relationships after Dhoni. But the past began to haunt Raai when the news of Dhoni's retirement from test cricket had started doing the rounds. People had started talking their failed relationship and it affected Raai a lot and even went to call her relationship with Dhoni a 'scar'. ""I've begun to believe that my relationship with Dhoni is like a stain or a scar which won't go away for a long time. I am surprised that people still have the energy and patience left to talk about it even now. Every time TV channels dig into Dhoni's past, they make it a point to bring up our relationship. I dread to think that someday my kids in future will see it on TV and ask me about it,"" Raai Laxmi had opened up about dating MS Dhoni in an old interview with The Times Of India. She had further added, ""I have had three or four relationships after Dhoni, but no one seems to have noticed it. I knew him really well and don't know if I can call it a relationship because it never worked out. We still have respect for each other. He has moved on and gotten married. That's the end of the story. I am a very happy person right now and work is my priority."" In fact, Dhoni has never been questioned about his past girlfriends but Raai was when she had started promoting her Bollywood debut film Julie 2 wherein she had shedded her inhibitions for performing bold scenes and soon became the talking point in the industry. She had even hoped that the makers of MS Dhoni biopic won't be talking about their relationship in the movie as she had not given any such consent.","

514,2019-05-01,10:30:04,sports,indian-premier-league,IPL rules can hurt Kings XI after Ness Wadia fiasco: BCCI," Kings XI Punjab co-owner Ness Wadia being sentenced for drugs possession while on a skiing holiday to Japan could mean trouble for the Indian Premier League team. As per the Operational Rules of the cash-rich league, no team official involved with the league can act in a manner which brings disrepute to the team, the league, the BCCI or the game on or off the field. If guilty, the persons action can even lead to suspension of the team. While the matter is required to be first sent to the commission for investigation, the commission will then forward its finding to the ombudsman. Citing the manner in which Chennai Super Kings (CSK) had to bear the brunt for the acts of the team principal, a senior BCCI functionary said that KXIP could be in deep trouble. ""The KXIP are unfortunately looking at suspension as a best-case scenario and termination as a worst case scenario due to the conviction of an owner in a criminal case of drug possession. ""No less than the Lodha panel had suspended the CSK for two years because their team official was accused of betting. In this case, we have an owner convicted of drug possession by a criminal court. If he was a state cricket official he would have stood disqualified from holding office automatically. ""This also exposes the discriminatory provisions of the new BCCI constitution which is draconian for a state association but doesn't put any restriction on a franchise official even though IPL performances clearly matter more for selection to the Indian team than Ranji performances,"" the functionary told IANS. As per the IPL Operational Rules accessed by IANS, clause 14 of section 2 of the IPL Operational Rules state that each person subject to the operational rules shall not, whether during a match or otherwise, act or omit to act in any way which would or might reasonably be anticipated to have an adverse effect on the image and/or reputation of any Team, any Franchisee, any Player, any Team Official, the BCCI, the League and/or the Game or which would otherwise bring any of the foregoing into disrepute. It further states that the ombudsman and the commission may suspend a team or franchise from the league if any person representing the team/franchise breaches clause 14 of section 2. While adjudicating in the IPL betting matter against CSK and Rajasthan Royals, the Lodha panel had taken into consideration section 4, rule 1.1 of the Operational Rules, which puts strict obligations on each franchise that its team officials comply with the regulations. This was to ensure that cricket should be played not only within the laws but also within the spirit of game and nothing was done by its representatives (Team Officials), players and etc on the field or off the field which is contrary to the spirit of the game or which adversely affects the reputation of the game. This saw the Lodha panel not just ban CSK team principal Gurunath Meiyappan and RR co-owner Raj Kundra for life from any matches conducted by BCCI, but also suspended CSK and RR for two years. It is this precedent that is set to haunt the KXIP since CSK had been suspended for two years despite there being no adverse finding of misconduct against any player or the team. In fact, even as per the Lodha report, RR was suspended for Kundra's act of bringing the game into disrepute by betting and the three players' case wasn't the focal point in deciding the quantum of punishment. Whereas, in this particular case, a team owner has actually been convicted of a criminal offence. A BCCI executive said that it was strange that no statement had been made on such a matter by CEO Rahul Johri. ""It has been 24 hours and one has not heard a peep out of the BCCI CEO on a matter of this magnitude. Are we looking at a scenario where every transgression is becoming an opportunity for someone to try and build friendships at the cost of BCCI's image and the purity of the game and its administration?"" the executive questioned. Sadly, even the Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators (CoA) has not issued a statement on the matter even though the reputation of the league and the board is clearly at stake.","

While Russell drove KKR to a massive winning total of 232 runs by knocking 80 runs of 40 balls, Hardik Pandya pulled off 91 runs from 34 balls but failed to sail Mumbai Indians through the KKR storm. Coincidentally, Andre Russell's powerful knock came just hours before he could ring in his 31st birthday on April 29. His wife Jassym Lora, who was cheering for her husband witnessing his electrifying innings from the Eden Gardens stand, had a special interaction with her love of her life in the post match ceremony. In the most candid and adorable chat with his wife Jassym, Russell said that whenever he walks inside the ground, his aim is to impress his wife with his batting skills. ""Special night for me as well. It's my birthday. I always feel pressure because I want to make sure the fans are happy and I want to impress my beautiful wife every match,"" Russell said while interacting with his wife Jassym. He further added, ""It's an emotional feeling. It's the last game of the season in Kolkata. We knew that we had to leave the fans who have been giving us great support over the last six days with a bang. We surely did, won by 34 runs."" When Jassym affectionately asked Russell if he considers his beautiful wife as a lucky charm, the loving husband, who couldn't stop blushing, replied, ""Yes. Of course"" filling Jassym's heart with immense happiness. Reacting to Russell's hard-hitting match-winning knock, Jassym told her husband, ""It felt good. I knew you were going to do that because today is the last match in this ground [Eden Gardens]. I expected that from you. I really heart in my hands when you were hitting those big sixes."" Gazing into Russell's eyes with love, Jassym told her husband that she wants to wish him a very happy birthday which melted the strong man's heart like an ice cream. ""Thank you so much babe,"" Russell replied and gave Jassym a warm and tight hug making the viewers go completely awww with their loving chemistry. Jassym also posted a few moments giving a glimpse into Russell's birthday celebrations on her Instagram story section and even posted a nude picture of her husband while taking a shower.

516,2019-04-26,15:11:27,sports,indian-premier-league,"Ashoke Dinda infuriated by RCB's reference to 'Dinda Academy', lashes out on Instagram"," Ashoke Dinda has been a successful medium pace bowler for Bengal in domestic cricket. His international career, unfortunately, never flourished. For most ardent followers of Indian cricket, the most enduring memory of him might be getting hit for a six on the last ball of a T20I match at Wankhede Stadium by Eoin Morgan when his team needed 5 to win. This seems to have left a rather negative image of the right-arm pacer as a profligate and incompetent bowler. In these days of social media, a stereotype can become popular very quickly and that's what has happened to Dinda also. During the ongoing season of IPL, every time a bowler has proven to be expensive or failed to deliver at crucial times, he has been declared a member of 'Dinda Academy' by the Twitterati. For a long time, these kinds of references were limited to fans. But on April 24, after Royal Challengers Bangalore defeated Kings XI Punjab with Umesh Yadav picking up three wickets and bowling well in the final over, even the official Twitter handle of RCB put out a tweet which read: 'Dinda Academy? What's that?' with a picture of Umesh below. This followed the reaction of fans to an earlier match where the RCB bowler almost failed to defend 26 runs in the last over against a rampaging Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Yadav had been announced as a member of 'Dinda Academy' on social media at that time. This provocation from an official Twitter handle proved too much for the Bengal seamer and he vented his spleen on Instagram. His post had a very clear message for those who decided to have a chuckle at his expense: ""Haters, helping you get you statistics right. Stop and stare well your opinion is not my reality. So shut your hating selves and keep me out of your mouth."" This text was attached to a picture showing his IPL record: 78 matches, 75 innings, 69 wickets, economy of 8.20 and average of 30.04. The RCB twitter page had removed the tweet well before this outburst from Dinda. The reactions from the fans to Dinda's rebuke are, as would be expected, of a mixed nature. Some have backed the bowler while some feel he has been too sensitive. Some, meanwhile, continue to poke fun at him. But it is undeniable that judging Dinda on the basis of a few performances is wrong. The 35-year old has played 115 first-class matches and picked 417 wickets. In 92 List A games, he grabbed 141 scalps while his overall T20 record features 146 wickets in 144 games. He was able to represent India in 13 ODIs and 9 T20Is without any ground-shaking performance.","

517,2019-04-23,19:25:57,sports,indian-premier-league,"Who is Beuran Hendricks, Mumbai Indians' replacement for Alzarri Joseph?"," Mumbai Indians have suffered a big jolt with their West Indian paceman Alzarri Joseph ruled out of the rest of the IPL with an injury. The replacement for the Antiguan fast bowler is South Africa's Beuran Hendricks. In an interesting turn of events, Joseph, who himself came as a replacement for New Zealander Adam Milne, now will be substituted by a player from a third country. Joseph has been playing international cricket for some time but made a big splash in the IPL this year when, on his league debut, he managed incredible figures of 6/12 to dismantle Sunrisers Hyderabad. This set a new record for the best performance by a debutant in IPL. So, who is Beuran Hendricks? Does he have the ability to prove effective for the Rohit Sharma-led side? To begin with, Hendricks is a left-arm seamer unlike Joseph and hence would provide a different angle. Like many South African pacemen, he too has a smooth bowling action and can generate good pace. In 2013, he managed to catapult himself to the attention of fans and experts by performing exceptionally well for South Africa A in series against India A and Australia A. He was expected to make the jump to international cricket and emerge as the next fast bowling sensation for the Proteas. It was around this time that he also caught the attention of IPL franchisees and got picked by Kings XI Punjab. However, neither his international career nor the IPL stint produced expected results and Hendricks went into the background. He was overtaken by other emerging bowlers such as Kagiso Rabada and Duanne Olivier. For a long time, the 28-year old remained out of the national team. He was brought back into the team earlier this year and earned his debut in the ODI format. But with his left-arm angle, ability to swing the ball and good speed, he may still make an impact. If he does that, there may be a revival of his international career. With the likes of Rabada and Lungi Ngidi becoming top performers, it would be hard to break his way into the South Africa Test team. But if there is one thing Proteas lack, it is a quality left-arm pacer. This is the void that Hendricks can fill. But presently, he has to help his team Mumbai Indians keep themselves in the top-four and if possible, ascend to a place higher than their current no. 3 position. Bowling with the likes of Lasith Malinga and Jasprit Bumrah will help him immensely. If he can pick up a few tricks from these two, it would be an even bigger gain.","

518,2019-04-21,15:26:27,sports,indian-premier-league,IPL 2019 reserve bench XI - Here are the international stars who haven't played enough," The Indian Premier League is filled with riches, not just financially but also of talent. There are many players who start for their international teams but somehow cannot get a look in for their respective franchises because of the rule that allows only four overseas players to play for each team.  Here, we take a look at IPL 2019's underutilised XI.  Martin Guptill - Guptill is New Zealand's opener in the limited overs formats of the game but cannot make it to the playing XI of SunRisers Hyderabad because of the presence of David Warner and Jonny Bairstow. He is a proven matchwinner in the T20 format but the IPL is yet to see the damage he can cause with the bat in hand. He will come into the playing XI once Warner and Bairstow leave for the World Cup commitments.  Colin Munro - He is Guptill's opening partner for the Kiwis and is the number 2 ranked batsman in the T20 format. But cannot find a place in the Delhi Capitals side as the opening slot is locked down by India internationals Shikhar Dhawan and Prithvi Shaw. The middle order is manned by Colin Ingram and it looks likely that Munro will warm the bench this entire season.  Wriddhiman Saha - He is India's number 1 wicketkeeper in the Test format and came into the tournament with a century in the domestic T20 tournament. He also has an IPL century which he scored for Kings XI Punjab in the 2014 final against Kolkata Knight Riders. In T20s, he is a top-order batsman and for his franchise, Bairstow does the same job. But he will be another beneficiary once the Englishman leaves.  Karun Nair - He's one of only two Indians to score a triple century in Test matches but life has not been the same for Nair since that innings against England in 2017. He does not find a place in India's Test squad anymore and neither has he been getting games for his IPL franchise Kings XI Punjab.  Shakib Al Hasan - He's arguably one of the most decorated all-rounders of all time and is a legend in Bangladeshi cricket. A winner of the IPL in 2012 and 2014, Shakib has been kept out of the team as SRH has overseas talent in great number.  Washington Sundar - An extremely talented cricketer who can bat in the top order and bowl some handy off-spinners, he has not been able to replicate the form he showed in IPL 2017 and thus cannot get into an RCB team which has been performing well below par.  Mohammad Nabi - A mercurial talent from Afghanistan, he is a proven matchwinner with the ball and can hit a long ball with the bat. He has been a successful finisher in the Big Bash League and also bowls in the powerplay. But he could muster only a few games for SRH this season.  Tim Southee - Another player who did not get enough chances for RCB is Kiwi international Tim Southee. He's one of the best Test match bowlers around but even for an underperforming RCB, he did not get too many games and that is largely due to Andre Russell, who plundered him at the Chinnaswamy Stadium.  Trent Boult - Neither can Southee's bowling partner Boult find a place in his franchise's team as Rabada has been absolutely groundbreaking this season and leads the purple cap race. The other overseas bowler's slot has been occupied by Nepali leggie Sandeep Lamichhane.  Basil Thampi - He burst onto the scene with Gujarat Lions in the 2017 season of the IPL and was then snapped by SRH but his bad luck is the very franchise that picked him. His team has a plethora of quick bowling talent in Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Sidharth Kaul, Khaleel Ahmed and Sandeep Sharma. Another franchise like KKR could have very well used him.  Ish Sodhi - He is ranked 8th by ICC in the world in the T20 format but he cannot find a place in the Rajasthan Royals camp as the team has other international stars like Steve Smith, Jos Buttler, Jofra Archer and Ben Stokes. But once the aforementioned leave for World Cup commitments, he could find his place in the team. ","

519,2019-04-21,13:28:31,sports,indian-premier-league,Shikhar Dhawan mocks R Ashwin; responds to 'Mankad' warning with a bizarre dance [Video]," The match at Feroz Shah Kotla featured the teams ranked three and four on the points table, thus the stakes were pretty high. Punjab batted first and scored 163 in their 20 overs and in response, Delhi made a solid start to reach 108 runs for the loss of the solitary wicket of young Prithvi Shaw in the 13th over.  After two balls of the over had been bowled, Delhi Capitals skipper Shreyas Iyer was on strike and Ashwin was the bowler. The skipper of KXIP, instead of delivering the ball, stopped his run-up immediately as reached the popping crease, gave a glance at an advancing Dhawan at the non-striker's end and went back to the start of his mark to bowl the next delivery. This was the second non-verbal warning of the match for Dhawan as he had earlier wandered well outside his crease in the 12th over. On that occasion, Murugan Ashwin warned the Delhi batsman. Dhawan, not one to back away from a challenge, proceeded to do a stretch after planting his bat inside the crease as Ashwin returned to his bowling mark. But what took the cake and got a massive applause was when the Delhi batsman pulled out some of his nightclub moves. As Ashwin was delivering the third ball of the over, Dhawan -- with bat inside the crease at the non-striker's end -- gyrated his hips and shook his entire body with eyes fixed on the bowler.  ""That was great to watch, the crowd also joining in. They are watching all this -- fun games,"" said Sanjay Manjrekar on commentary as fellow commentator Lisa Sthalekar could be heard laughing hysterically in the background. ""This is a nice little byplay between the two. But you can sense that this is a crucial moment [in the match]. Yeah, he [Dhawan's] not going to make the mistake [of leaving his crease] again,"" said Sthalekar. ""He's done a twist from the '60s,"" concluded Manjrekar as replays of Dhawan's odd, yet adorable, dance moves were shown in the replays.  Dhawan played a handy knock of 56 in the match as he helped Delhi chase down the score with two balls to spare. The India international was dismissed by Hardus Viljoen and incidentally, it was Ashwin who took a fantastic catch, running to his left. After Dhawan's dismissal, it was skipper Shreyas Iyer who took charge and saw his side home courtesy a man of the match performance.  With that victory, Delhi moved to 12 points from 10 games and consolidated their third-place position on the points table. The capital franchise will face Rajasthan Royals in their next game at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur on April 22. ","

520,2019-04-20,15:42:40,sports,indian-premier-league,Ajinkya Rahane sacked; Steve Smith takes over as Rajasthan Royals captain," After enduring a disappointing season so far, Rajasthan Royals have made a major decision. Former Australia captain Steve Smith has been handed over the captaincy of the team in place of Ajinkya Rahane. The Jaipur-based side is lying second-last on the points table, above only Royal Challengers Bangalore. They have managed only two victories in their eight matches and have suffered six losses. On top of that, the team is on the verge of being knocked out and have the near-impossible task of winning almost all their remaining six matches in order to give themselves a chance of going into the playoffs. Things are only going to get tougher for the side as two of their most important players – Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes – will leave the team and return to their national side. Smith himself will leave the team on May 1, though, by that time, the Royals would have just one game remaining – provided they don't reach the playoffs. In this scenario, the team management has decided to hand over the captaincy to a man who has had success in the leadership role. Steve Smith was the captain of Rising Pune Supergiant in the 2017 season and took his team to the brink of winning the trophy. They lost a thrilling final by just one run but enjoyed considerable success that year. Smith's leadership came under a huge cloud when he was found engaged in the dubious tactic of ball-tampering during the third Test in South Africa last year. The prolific right-hander was stripped of his captaincy and handed a one-year ban. However, the Rajasthan side feels that his leadership qualities are just what their fledgeling side needs as they struggle to find their footing in the current season of IPL. In a statement that sought to soften the blow for Rahane, the team management said, ""Ajinkya Rahane did a fantastic job in leading the team to the playoffs last year. However, the franchisee now thinks a fresh approach is needed to bring their 2019 campaign back on track. Steve has always been part of the leadership team within RR and Rahane will continue to be a key voice in the side."" This return to leadership comes at a key moment for Smith. Tainted by the ball-tampering scandal, he now has an opportunity to re-establish his leadership credentials. In the long run, this gives the former Aussie captain a chance to regain his position. At the moment though, he has a mountain to climb and would need the support of every player – Rahane included. But he has nothing to lose and everything to gain from this promotion.","

521,2019-04-20,13:59:13,sports,indian-premier-league,Andre Russell - Robbie Uthappa is afraid to get out; slams KKR for not being flexible," Andre Russell and Nitish Rana almost pulled off a miraculous run chase for the Kolkata Knight Riders when they played Royal Challengers Bangalore at the Eden Gardens on April 19. KKR was asked to score 214 runs to win the game but fell short by 10 runs in the end despite an extremely slow start.  ""To lose by 10 runs, it's just two hits away. In the middle period, if we scored a bit faster we would definitely get the runs even with balls to spare,"" an extremely disappointed Russell opined at the post-match press conference on Friday. ""Well batted to Nitish, but this is something that we definitely disappointed and that's why I have a sweet and sour feeling."" KKR had got off to a disastrous start as they lost the wicket of Chris Lynn in the very first over. He was soon followed by Sunil Narine, which prompted Robbie Uthappa to come to the crease and when Shubman Gill was dismissed, Nitish Rana joined KKR's vice-captain. But KKR only reached 44 runs at the end of the 8 overs.  Although Rana, once settled, started forcing the issue, Uthappa's approach was inexplicable. The senior player scored only 9 runs off 20 balls when he got dismissed but the baffling part of his game was that he did not even look the force the issue, allowing the run rate to creep up to 17.5 when Andre Russell walked in.  Talking to the media about whether he should have batted in place of Uthappa at number, Russell nodded and said that KKR must be flexible in their approach. ""I believe that,"" Russell said with a sheepish smile and a finger on his lip, as if not to outrightly question his team management's policy but also take a dig at the same time. ""Because I believe that once I'm at the crease, Virat Kohli will bowl the best bowlers to get me out, and those best bowlers will, therefore, have less overs remaining in the back end."" ""So even if I score 60 off 25 balls and give the team the early pump, then the type of bowlers like Dale Steyn will have only one over to bowl at the death, or they maybe are even bowled out. So, I think me going to bat early would definitely be good for KKR, but with our make-up as a team, I don't think it's a good time, at the moment. Because for me to bat in the back-end and know what I can do in four or five overs but..."" Russell stopped short of saying the obvious.  Rana and Russell had brought KKR back from a seemingly improbable position wherein they required 20 runs per over to touching distance. The two had put on a 118-run stand for the fifth wicket but the valiant effort of both batsmen went in vain as Rana finished on 85 off 46 and Russell was run out on 65 off 25.  It was a wonderful game of cricket to watch and despite the superhuman efforts of Russell, KKR has been falling short in too many games which means the rest of the team has to stand up. Thus, it was understandable why he was upset after the game. KKR will need to now win four out of their last five games to qualify for the playoffs and it will be unfair on Russell if they do not make it. ","

522,2019-04-19,19:50:58,sports,indian-premier-league,Hardik Pandya steals Dhoni's helicopter shot again; guess who else has done it?," During the IPL match between Delhi Capitals and Mumbai Indians, Hardik Pandya, during his innings of 32 off 15 balls, hit some breath-taking boundaries. None was more eye-catching than the 'helicopter shot' – made popular by Mahendra Singh Dhoni – which he employed to his benefit. This wasn't the first time either. He had played the same shot earlier against Chennai Super Kings, with the inventor of the stroke standing behind him and looking on helplessly. Now, Pandya has revealed that he went to the master's room to know how he felt about the all-rounder's version of this legendary stroke. Apparently, Dhoni approved it. But whether he considers Pandya a better exponent of the shot, we can only guess. However, Pandya isn't the first player to dare to copy this Dhoni special. The first time we saw its imitation was way back in 2012 during a World T20 match. And that too happened, right in front of Dhoni. During India's round-robin match against Afghanistan, the latter team came out to chase a target of 160 set by the men-in-blue. The openers for Afghanistan were Mohammad Shahzad and Nawroz Mangal. Shahzad, a self-confessed fan of MS Dhoni, decided to take the attack to the Indian bowlers. During the third over of Afghanistan's innings, Shahzad played his own, slightly clumsy version of his idol's signature stroke. This helicopter shot didn't go too far above the ground and much squarer than the usual one played by Dhoni. Even the follow-through wasn't the same. But it was a close enough imitation to earn a boundary for the Afghan and also for him to hold the pose and let cameras capture the moment. What made his stroke all the more amazing was that Shahzad had announced before the match that he would be playing it. After he executed this shot, the cameras panned to MS Dhoni's face, although it remained as unmoved as ever. Eventually, Shahzad could manage only 18 runs and two boundaries apart from this one. Afghanistan fought hard but fell short by 23 runs. However, the Afghan had already increased his fan following and got fans of Dhoni to take notice. The key difference between Shahzad and Pandya is that, while the former is rather plump in his physique, Hardik is lean and fit. No wonder that the Mumbai Indians all-rounder is able to play this shot much better than the Afghan keeper-batsman. The huge sixes that the Baroda lad has hit in IPL using this unique stroke would make even the most loyal Dhoni fan take notice. But, one cannot take away the fact that it was Shahzad who showed the courage and conviction to execute this shot. It might well remain the most famous shot of his career.","

523,2019-04-16,15:35:33,sports,indian-premier-league,KXIP vs RR: R Ashwin to 'Mankad' Jos Buttler again?," The IPL match between Kings XI Punjab and Rajasthan Royals would have been another game of the league with usual ramifications, if not for one thing that happened in their previous encounter – Mankading. Ravichandran Ashwin's decision to run Jos Buttler out at the non-striker end without issuing the conventional warning led to heated debates on playing the game in the right spirit. Both players have stuck to their stated positions. Ashwin insists there is nothing wrong in doing what he did while Buttler remains adamant that Ashwin's actions are not in keeping with the 'spirit of the game.' So, as the two teams face off for the second time this season and the likelihood of Ashwin and Buttler coming face-to-face at the non-striker's end increases, what can we expect? Here are five scenarios that may unfold when this situation arises. Déjà vu We could see a repeat of the Mankading incident. Buttler may disregard what happened last time, thinking that after all the hullabaloo, Ashwin won't dare to repeat his actions. He leaves his crease again but the Indian offie refuses to back down and dislodges the bails. Umpires are forced to give the batsman out. An angry confrontation ensues, both players argue in colourful language. More vilification of Ashwin in English media, more justification of his act in Indian media and a very tense atmosphere is created between the teams. Ashwin decides to issue a warning Having seen the reaction to his Mankading of Buttler last time, Ashwin becomes more cautious. He notices Buttler stepping out of the crease again and, after aborting his delivery of the ball, turns around and tells Buttler that this is his first and last warning. Buttler nods his head and doesn't repeat the mistake. It's an unstated acceptance by Ashwin that his actions last time were not fully kosher but also a concession made by Buttler that he has to be careful. Buttler exercises caution Once bitten, twice shy. After the incident in the previous match against KXIP, Buttler takes no chances and keeps not just his bat but even one of his feet behind the crease while Ashwin delivers the ball. There is no incident and match finishes without any controversy. The most boring, yet the most likely scenario. Royals turn the tables Still feeling betrayed by Ashwin's act, Rajasthan Royals decide to teach his team a lesson. They keep a close eye on all the batsmen from Kings XI to see who is leaving the crease before due time. When one of them does, the bowlers hits the wicket and points to the batsman being out of the crease. But the appeal is not made by the captain and Royals take the moral high ground. Revenge is sweet Similar to the last scenario but with a crucial difference. The Royals do make an appeal and get the Kings XI batsman out. Ashwin cannot complain, neither could his team.

524,2019-04-14,13:35:41,sports,indian-premier-league,'MS Dhoni should be banned' - Viru Sehwag's shocking statement ahead of World Cup," Virender Sehwag is clearly not impressed with MS Dhoni's actions and wants the Chennai Super Kings captain to be banned for two to three games in order to set a correct precedent with regards to on-field behaviour.  MS Dhoni had courted controversy when he walked out onto the field of play during the last over of CSK's run chase against Rajasthan Royals in Jaipur on April 11. Ben Stokes was bowling the last over and defending 18 runs. With half of the over bowled, CSK had already scored 10 runs but Dhoni had just been dismissed by the English all-rounder, prompting New Zealand all-rounder Mitchell Santner to come to the crease.  The fourth ball of the over is when the controversy happened as umpire Ulhas Gandhe signalled a no-ball for height. The buzzers at the Sawai Mansingh stadium went off, signalling a free hit as Chennai had pinched two runs. But Bruce Oxenford, who was the leg umpire and responsible for calling no-balls for height, said that he did not signal anything. This prompted umpire Gandhe to reverse his decision.  Dhoni was furious with the turn of events and marched onto the pitch gesticulating vividly. He was right unhappy as the ball clearly looked to be above the waist and should have been declared a no-ball. But the gentleman's game has no provision for a player already dismissed to walk into the field of play in the middle of an over to question an umpire -- even if that player is CSK captain MS Dhoni.  Talking about this incident, Sehwag told Cricbuzz that Dhoni should be banned for a few games to create a proper example. ""I feel Dhoni was let off easy and should have been banned for at least 2-3 games. Because if he did this, tomorrow another captain can do the same. Then what is the value of an umpire,"" Sehwag said. ""I feel he should have been banned for a few games by IPL to set an example. He should have stayed outside and instead have talked to the fourth umpire with the walkie talkie."" ""I feel he shouldn't have come to the ground when there are two CSK members already and they were equally inquisitive regarding the no-ball,"" Sehwag opined. ""Had he done this for the Indian team, I would have been happy. I have never seen him so angry during his captaincy days for the Indian team. So I feel he became a little too emotional for the Chennai team."" Dhoni was fined 50 per cent of his match fee for that incident but it is common perception that the former Indian skipper was let off lightly for his demeanour. Dhoni will be seen in action on April 14 at the Eden Gardens when CSK faces Kolkata Knight Riders. ","

525,2019-04-13,14:56:49,sports,indian-premier-league,Shah Rukh Khan left sad by KKR; says team lacked heart against Delhi Capitals," Kolkata Knight Riders has lost two games on the bounce and from being on the top of the table, question marks are being raised about their chances of making it to the playoffs. Amid growing concerns and missing players, owner of the KKR franchise, Shah Rukh Khan, has been left sad by his team's bowling performance against Delhi Capitals at Eden Gardens on April 12.  KKR lost to Delhi Capitals by 7 wickets as they chased down 179 runs with more than an over to spare. Delhi was powered by a fantastic performance by Shikhar Dhawan, who remained unbeaten on 97 when Colin Ingram hit Piyush Chawla for a six to bring up Delhi's fourth win of the campaign. The match was KKR's third defeat in seven games and although they are still on the second spot on the points table, Mumbai Indians and Kings XI Punjab can send them to the fourth spot by Saturday night.  After the game, Shah Rukh Khan took to his Twitter account to express his feelings about the game. Congratulating Shubman Gill and Andre Russell, the 'Badshah of Bollywood' said that his team lacked heart. SRK is well regarded for being one of the nicest owners in the IPL and does not interfere with his team but the king of hearts in Bollywood does know a thing or two about hearts. He tweeted, ""Wonderful play by ShubmanGill & Andre Russell yet again. Losing is ok but today we kind of lacked heart, especially bowling, that's sad. Only positive out of this game was that our Dada Sourav Ganguly was at Eden on the winning side. Congrats Delhi Capitals"" Shah Rukh Khan's assessment of the game was not too far off the mark either as skipper Dinesh Karthik also reckoned that although the score was below par, his team could have bowled better. ""To be honest the par score was 10-15 runs more than that. We didn't bat well and didn't post a good score. I expected our bowlers to perform better, that didn't happen though. I think picking wickets on this ground has been difficult but bowlers can work on few areas and come back harder. That's what IPL is all about, coming back stronger every time you can,"" said Karthik.  The difference between KKR and DC was how the teams played in the middle overs. While DC managed to keep the momentum between the 8th to the 13th over, KKR's batting effort got derailed. Robbie Uthappa and Nitish Rana failed to provide an impetus to the innings as the former scored 28 off 30, while the latter got 11 runs off 12 balls. The duo effectively scored below six runs an over for seven overs in a 20-over game on a pitch where 10 runs per over is par.  KKR will now have to set their season back on track when they face Chennai Super Kings at home on April 14.","

526,2019-04-12,13:57:13,sports,indian-premier-league,MS Dhoni in trouble for outburst; Twitter slams CSK skipper for 'being out of line'," For MS Dhoni, criticisms and praises do not quite fluster him as he takes them both in his stride. But when he walked out on to the field from the dugout to argue with the umpires, it was an uncharacteristic burst from the Chennai Super Kings skipper. ""He was certainly fired up the way the decision was handled and why it was overturned. It was a lack of clarity, obviously from him and he wanted to get it clarified at a key moment,"" Fleming said in the post-match presentation. However, this has not gone down well with the match officials and the skipper has now been slapped with a 50 per cent fine of his match fees. ""MS Dhoni, the Chennai Super Kings captain, was fined 50 per cent of his match fees for breaching the Indian Premier League's Code of Conduct during his team's match against Rajasthan Royals at Jaipur,"" the league said in a statement. The CSK skipper lauded Rajasthan Royals for being brilliant with the ball and in the field despite posting a par score on the pitch. CSK lost four wickets in the powerplay overs when Dhoni and Rayudu strung an important partnership to bail them out of trouble. ""It was a very good game. Need to give credit to Rajasthan. They were slightly few runs short on what would've been a good score. But they put pressure on our batsmen and they were able to build pressure right to the end. Once you win games like this, you learn a lot out of it. It's important to enjoy the win but also learn from the mistakes,"" Dhoni said. Rajasthan skipper Ajinkya Rahane too praised the efforts of his bowlers and fielders for putting CSK under the pump despite a below-par score on the board. Also, despite results not going his way, Rahane said that he was enjoying the role and taking every game one step at a time. ""I don't think so (when asked if he'd have done anything differently). Credit to our bowlers, on that wicket I thought 150 was low. We should have batted better, on that wicket 170 would have been very good. We feel disappointed. It was about having the belief,"" Rahane said. Chennai Super Kings managed to get home courtesy a last ball six by Mitchell Santner as Dhoni's side extended their lead at the top of the points table. Despite the result, former cricketers took to Twitter and criticised the skipper for behaving in such a way and even called the behaviour to be way out of line.","

527,2019-04-12,13:09:29,sports,indian-premier-league,RCB summons 'Captain Marvel' to save IPL season? Twitter erupts like wildfire," Dale Steyn loves a tease and his recent post on Instagram flaunting an Indian visa drove his fans in the subcontinent wild as they started speculating that the South African speedster is on his way to join Royal Challengers Bangalore. Steyn is a veteran in international cricket and still remains one of the most feared pace bowlers in the world. The Protean took to his Instagram account on April 11 and posted a picture of his passport which showed an Indian visa. He captioned his Instagram story, ""Ahhh, what's this little surprise"" and the text was followed by a wink emoticon. Although no confirmation has been made on Steyn's exact role in the IPL, fans think that he will be joining RCB following their disastrous start wherein they have lost all six games thus far. This is the joint-worst start to any IPL campaign by any team, matching the dubious record set in 2013 by the then Delhi Daredevils. The fact that RCB will not have the services of Nathan Coulter Nile has added fuel to fire. Coulter Nile missed the opening leg of the IPL due to international commitments and is still unavailable owing to personal reasons. He might not be able to play the IPL's final leg as well if he gets selected for the Australian World Cup squad. These reasons combined led to excitement on Twitter where fans are certain that Dale Steyn could be the Captain Marvel of their IPL campaign and save them. Sudhanshu - Dale Steyn is Joining RCB. Can't wait though Merin Kumar - Dale Steyn to join RCB tomorrow Romsha - RCB fans are sticking to whatever little ray of hope they can stick to. Right now, it is Dale Steyn's IG story! Maganlal - Dale Steyn joining RCB apparently. The utter state of that franchise. Zoro - Will take Dale Steyn in all fairness tbh. Enough of roadmen. Want to see some proper players playing for us. Abhishek - Dale Steyn has been getting smacked in the death overs on a regular basis since his comeback. So it's only fitting that RCB sign him. The 35-year-old pace bowler is an IPL veteran and has played as many as 90 games in the T20 tournament. Steyn was previously a part of the RCB franchise for three years between 2008 and 2010. He played 28 matches in that period and picked up 27 wickets at an economy rate of 6.79 runs per over. In that time, his best bowling figures came in his last season when he picked up 3-18. Steyn then went on to play for the now defunct Deccan Chargers for two seasons – 2011 and 2012. For the Hyderabad-based franchise, Steyn played 24 games and picked up 32 wickets at an economy rate of 6.34 runs per over. In the 2012 edition of the IPL, Steyn picked up his career-best figures of 3-8. The former world number 1 Test bowler played for SunRisers Hyderabad for the next three seasons, between 2013 and 2015. For the 2016 champions, Steyn turned out in 37 matches and picked up 33 wickets at an economy rate of 7.43 runs per over. Steyn showed signs of waning in his final season with the franchise as he played only 6 matches, picking up 3 wickets at his career-highest economy rate of 8.94 runs per over. Following that, Steyn only played in one IPL match when he was picked up by Gujarat Lions. In that game, he bowled only two overs and conceded 17 runs without any scalps. In total, Steyn played 90 IPL matches and picked up 92 wickets at an economy rate of 6.72 runs per over. This season, Steyn had a base price of Rs 1.5 crore but went unsold.","

528,2019-04-11,15:29:13,sports,indian-premier-league,Ravi Ashwin subjected to violent treatment by England cricketer; But why? [Watch]," Ravichandran Ashwin's picture was subject to violent treatment by James Anderson as he shredded an image of the off-spinner in response to the Jos Buttler 'mankading' incident. The aforementioned incident took place on March 25 during an Indian Premier League match between Kings XI Punjab and Rajasthan Royals in Jaipur. The hosts were well on track chasing down 185 to win their opening game of IPL 2019 and had already notched up 108 runs in the 13th over. Sanju Samson was on strike for the final ball of the over when, instead of delivering the ball, Ashwin proceeded to knock off the bails at the non-striker's end. Buttler was a couple of strides outside the crease and he was, by the laws of the game, adjudged run out. But the Englishman was extremely disappointed with Ashwin as he believed that the Indian cricketer did not play by the 'spirit of the game'. ""No really argument to that (Mankading incident) and it's pretty instinctive. I actually didn't load and he left the crease. That's always been my take on it because it's my half of the crease. I was not even at the crease, he wasn't even looking at me and he just left the place,"" Ashwin had said about the 'mankading' controversy in the post-match prize distribution ceremony. Reacting to that, England pace bowler Anderson went ahead and shredded a picture of Ashwin to make his emotions clear. EXCLUSIVE: @jimmy9 give us his unique take on @josbuttler’s controversial run out last week...More rows should be settled like this.Full story on this week’s #Tailenders https://t.co/YOQ4PMSwiu pic.twitter.com/hYCPpdSqJm Ashwin also reacted to the Anderson and said that maybe Anderson will feel differently the day he does something similar. ""Maybe, tomorrow he might end up doing it [a 'Mankad']. Who knows? It is a question of perception of right and wrong,"" said Ashwin. 'I don't think in this case it is necessary because it is in the law and I did. Everybody who know me, it is very clear (to them) that I don't do anything that is illegal."" ""Even my team has stood behind me since then. A lot many players have come to me and said whatever I did was absolutely right. Ashwin told India Today. When asked whether the incident has had any effect on him personally, the offie said, ""Not really, it hasn't affected me one bit at all. 'I am very happy that they (former and current England players) are standing up for their fellow countryman. I definitely think that my countrymen have also stood up for me. And it is only fair that your peers stand up for you."" Ashwin also wanted the lawmakers to provide more clarity on rules such as the 'mankad' as it has become synonymous with the abstract concept of the 'spirit o the game'. ""I actually think that if you bring in the 'Spirit of the Game' into this and keep on talking about it again and again, it is up to the authorities to decide that whether you want to continue this as a rule of the game or not,"" Ashwin concluded.","

529,2019-04-11,15:03:05,sports,indian-premier-league,Kuldeep Yadav to Praveen Tambe - Five spinners who rose to fame through IPL," Imran Tahir and Harbhajan Singh's exploits in the game against KKR once more underlined the value of spinners in IPL and, in general, T20 cricket. This is completely contrary to the concerns many experts expressed when this format was taking roots around the world. The likes of Ravichandran Ashwin and Sunil Narine became major stars after success in this format. But these are not the only ones. Many other spinners have become household names through IPL. Let's look at five such examples. In T20 spin bowling, the value of variations and mystery cannot be overstated. And Kuldeep has that in abundance. Chinaman style of bowling has never been very popular in India. The lad from Uttar Pradesh changed that by bowling accurately and using variations astutely to fox the batsmen. The success in IPL led Kuldeep to becoming a regular member of Indian team and among the best bowlers in world cricket. One of the many spinners who prospered under MS Dhoni's tutelage in IPL, the high point in his career came during Chennai Super Kings' 2010 triumph where he played a key part. After enjoying a good run with this team, he fell away when the franchises decided to pose their faith in other tweakers. 41 years old and never having played first-class cricket, Pravin Tambe, a club-cricketer in Mumbai, suddenly found himself catapulted to star status when Rajasthan Royals picked him in their 2013 IPL squad. The leg-spinner responded by making a mark in the 2013 IPL and even more so, in Champions League T20 a few months later. Tambe relied more on accuracy than turn or flight for success – a common theme with wrist bowlers in this format. He faded away after having a good 2014 season. How different T20 cricket is from other formats can be gauged by the story of Ajit Chandila. This off-spinner from Haryana couldn't even get into his state's domestic team. Then came IPL and everything changed. He rose to fame by picking up a hat-trick in the 2012 edition of the league and seemed likely to get more success. But the spot-fixing scandal brought him disgrace and curtailment of career. This left-arm spinner from Mumbai enjoyed a great time in the 2010-11 season – across formats. First, he emerged as one of the leading wicket-takers in Ranji Trophy, then adapting his skills to T20 format, he bagged a rich haul of wickets in the 2011 edition for Kolkata Knight Riders. Abdulla was declared as the rising star of IPL for his work but when it came to picking the Indian side – selectors preferred Rahul Sharma. Subsequently, this left-armer too went out of the spotlight.","

530,2019-04-11,14:18:31,sports,indian-premier-league,Matt Kelly - KKR sign Australia's secret World Cup weapon; Who is the yorker machine?," Kolkata Knight Riders has signed fiery Western Australian pacer Matt Kelly as a replacement for the injured South African paceman Anrich Nortje. He will be a part of the KKR squad for the rest of Indian Premier League season.  The 24-year-old quick bowler impressed everyone in the Big Bash League where he plied his trade for the Perth Scorchers. Fellow Western Australian and KKR assistant coach, Simon Katich, was evidently one of from the bunch of impressed personnel as he convinced his team's head coach Jacques Kallis to sign the youngster.  Matt Kelly has played only 12 senior T20 matches thus far in his career and seven of them have come during this season of the Big Bash League. In those seven matches, the pacer has picked up 11 wickets at an impressive economy rate of 7.74 runs per over.  Kelly's standout trait in the Big Bash League was his ability to master the art of death bowling by executing fast and accurate yorkers with consistent precision. The yorker has seemingly gone out of the game with bowlers trying different variations to no avail. Most of the death bowlers today are either bowling length balls or resorting to slower balls but the batsmen are managing to slog them with their brute power.  In this scenario, a bowler who can execute the yorker is a gift and KKR will be hoping that the Australian pacer can unleash his barrage of toe-crushers in the IPL.  Matt Kelly's ability to bowl the yorker has caught the attention of former Australian cricketer Mark Waugh too. The Aussie legend has, in fact, thrown Kelly's name into the hat for World Cup selection.  ""I've got one bolter from Western Australia, Matt Kelly, who no one's spoken about,"" Waugh told Big Sports Breakfast radio program. Australia has a rich line of pace bowlers gunning to make it to the World Cup squad with the likes of Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, Jhye Richardson, Nathan Coulter-Nile and Jason Behrendorff gunning for a place on the flight to England in May.  But Waugh believes that Kelly possesses a skill very few of the aforementioned do. ""One thing we do lack slightly is a really good death bowler — a guy who can bowl yorkers at the end of the innings and he's really good at that,"" Waugh said. ""He played for the Scorchers and WA. He's a bit of a smoky but I'd have him the mix."" KKR has been able to unearth great potential over the years. Sunil Narine was an unknown entity before coming to the IPL and Andre Russell was a benchwarmer at Delhi before he joined KKR. But now the duo has won three of the last four Most Valuable Player awards in the IPL.  KKR also have a history of playing Aussie quicks with Brett Lee, Pat Cummins, James Pattinson and Mitchell Johnson all turning out for the franchise. Mitchell Starc was also snapped up by KKR but did not play for them owing to injury.  Kelly is the latest in the long line of quicks from Down Under in Eden Gardens but among all, he will be exposed to the most helpful home track at Eden Gardens compared to his countrymen. At 24, he is physically in his prime to exploit the pacy conditions and make a mark for himself in the IPL. ","

The latest star kid to join the father is Hinaya Heer Plaha, daughter of CSK cricketer of Harbhajan Singh. In a recent video, Bhajji's wife Geeta Basra can be heard asking Hinaya who she will be supporting during the match between CSK and Kolkata Knight Riders. To the question, Hinaya responds saying 'papa' meaning father. Geeta subsequently asked which team her father plays for in the Indian Premier League and Hinaya started chanting 'CSK CSK' while sporting an adorable smile.

After CSK won the toss and elected to bowl first, Bhajji was tasked with bowling to Sunil Narine in the batting power play. Narine has historically been extremely potent at plundering spinners during the power play. The West Indian had till the CSK game hit 111 runs in 5 overs of spin bowling. But Bhajji used all his experience to not bowl in Narine's hitting arc as he tossed the ball up, slightly away from the batsman on a good length at minimal speed and allowed the sluggish Chennai pitch to take over. The ball subsequently held up on the surface, turned and took the outer slice of Narine's willow as he advanced down the track to tonk the ball over long off. The ball ballooned up and Deepak Chahar ran towards the boundary from backward point to take a smart catch. Bhajji also dismissed Piyush Chawla at a crucial juncture in the innings when a partnership between the leggie and Andre Russell was threatening to take the game away from CSK. Coming to bowl in the 16th over when Chawla was looking to break free, Bhajji outfoxed his 2011 World Cup winning teammate by tossing a ball so wide of off stump that an advancing Chawla could not reach it. MS Dhoni completed the stumping to help his off-break bowler finish with figures of 2-15 in 4 overs. Bhajji also took a sharp catch in the match against KKR at midwicket to dismiss Dinesh Karthik when the KKR captain had found his groove and was milking the bowling in his usual manner. CSK went on to win the match by 7 wickets as their batsmen chased down the paltry total of 109 with more than 2 overs to spare.","

It was a selfie clicked by the RCB skipper along with Moeen Ali and Yuzvendra Chahal. The caption of the picture reads, ""Touchdown Mohali!""

In their next game against Mumbai Indians, the Bangalore brigade fell 6 runs short of Mumbai Indians' total of 187. There was major controversy in that game as Lasith Malinga clearly overstepped in the last ball of the final over but the umpire failed to spot it.  Kohli was naturally irate about the episode as if the umpire had signalled the no ball, RCB would have required 5 runs to win off the last ball with AB de Villiers on strike and the said ball would have been a free hit. ""We are playing at the IPL level and not playing club cricket. The umpires should have had their eyes open. That is a ridiculous call at the last ball. If it is a game of margins, I don't know what is happening,"" Kohli said after that match. In their third match, RCB was convincingly outplayed by SunRisers Hyderabad as openers David Warner and Jonny Bairstow scored centuries helping SRH score 231 runs. Kohli's men lost that match by 118 runs. They made a good comeback in the next match against KKR but failed to defend 205 as Andre Russell plundered the bowlers, helping his team chase 53 runs in the 11 balls. In their previous match, they were bested by Delhi Capitals who chased down 149 runs with more than an over to spare. RCB's next match is against Ravi Ashwin's Kings XI Punjab on April 13.","

533,2019-04-10,12:53:09,sports,indian-premier-league,MS Dhoni and Sakshi sleep on the airport floor; CSK captain takes a dig at IPL schedule," Chennai Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni could be seen sleeping on the floor of the Chennai airport in the early hours of Wednesday, April 9, and he took a sly dig at the Indian Premier League for its tight scheduling.  CSK played Kolkata Knight Riders at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai last night, April 9, and had to take an early morning flight today to travel to Jaipur where they will take on Rajasthan Royals on April 11. The IPL is synonymous with successive matches for teams with only a gap of one day between the said matches.  KKR's themselves came into the match against CSK with barely any rest as it was their third game in five days. It is now CSK's turn to travel and their captain found it necessary to catch up on some sleep ahead of the early morning flight following a late night game. He posted a picture of him and his wife sleeping on the floor of the airport on Instagram, captioning the picture, ""After getting used to IPL timing this is what happens if u have a morning flight"" Dhoni's caption was meant in good humour but one cannot overlook the underlying truth behind it. The IPL is a very demanding tournament because of the intensity of a T20 competition and the scheduling make things even tougher on the players who have to then focus more on avoiding injuries due to tiredness. In the last five days, KKR travelled to Bangalore and subsequently made a trip to Jaipur only to return to Chennai for a match last night. That is a lot of air time and they had to do all this in five days, playing three matches in the process. This puts the franchises in a dilemma as they have to juggle between practice and recovery in order to avoid stress-related muscle injuries. Compared to KKR, CSK has got a better schedule in their coming matches. Following their trip to Jaipur, they have a gap of two days before travelling to Kolkata to take on yesterday's opponent in the return fixture. The Super Kings will subsequently be travelling to Hyderabad and Bangalore but have been afforded gaps of two days and three days, respectively.  Despite the myriad travails of the IPL, CSK always manages to navigate through to the playoffs and looks set to do so in this edition of the T20 tournament too. The Chennai brigade reclaimed top spot on the points table when they beat table-toppers KKR on a sluggish Chepauk pitch. Asking KKR to bat first, Deepak Chahar combined with the spinners to restrict KKR to 108 and even that score was largely due to the mature heroics of Andre Russell.  In response, CSK cantered home in the 18th over despite losing two wickets in the power play. Opener Faf Du Plessis saw out the game as he batted through the innings till the end. ","

Cries in pain, limps off MI practice session"," Rohit Sharma walked off from Mumbai Indian's practice session on the eve of their Indian Premier League encounter against Kings XI Punjab after suffering an injury on his right thigh and this could deal a body blow to India's chances at the ICC World Cup 2019.  The Mumbai Indians skipper was doing his training drills on April 9 at the Wankhede Stadium and it was during his running session that Rohit pulled up clutching his right thigh. Rohit was in agonising pain as he could not keep standing and subsequently collapsed himself to the floor. He could be heard wincing in pain as he held onto his head in agony.  The Mumbai Indians physiotherapist Nitin Patel rushed to attend to Rohit who lay on the ground in pain. He checked on the Indian opener, following which Rohit gingerly held himself up on his feet and limped off the ground. He did not take any assistance in climbing up the staircase of the Wankhede Stadium which leads to the dressing room.  Mumbai Indians has not released any statement yet regarding the extent or severity of the injury but it looks either a muscle injury or a hamstring pull. In case, Rohit has injured his hamstring, it is a cause of concern for the Indian team as these kind of injuries take time to completely heal. The worrying factor is that Rohit went down by himself without any sort of external contact which means that something is wrong within his body. Rohit is an integral part of the Indian set up and is the vice-captain of the Indian limited overs side which is why everyone will be sweating over the severity of this injury. As is the protocol, the MI physiotherapist will now consult with the BCCI physiotherapist Patrick Farhart before taking any calls. This is not the first time an Indian player has been injured this IPL season as Jasprit Bumrah hurt his left shoulder in MI's opening match against Delhi Capitals. Thankfully on that occasion, Bumrah's injury was minor and he returned to action in the very next game.  Sports scientists across the world believe that the intensity of a T20 game takes a heavier toll on players than any other format in cricket. The IPL is thus a very demanding tournament when one takes all the travelling into consideration too. Workload management had been a point of heavy discussion ahead of the IPL given its proximity to the World Cup and now this debate will gain further steam.  The World Cup which will be played in England and Wales begins on May 30. India will play its first match on June 5 against South Africa at the Rose Bowl in Southampton. ","

535,2019-04-08,17:05:52,sports,indian-premier-league,Steve Smith and Ajinkya Rahane fight? Australian shows open dissent against captain," KKR easily bested Rajasthan in their last match and consequently moved to the top of the points table. Rajasthan had been restricted to 139 in their quota of 20 overs courtesy some fine slow bowling by the KKR spinners namely, Kuldeep Yadav, Sunil Narine and Piyush Chawla. Harry Gurney, who made his IPL debut was also impressive and was adjudged the man of the match for his efforts that fetched him 2-25 in four overs. Coming out to chase the total, KKR was off to a flying start courtesy the big-hitting of Sunil Narine who smashed Krishnappa Gowtham for 22 runs off his first over. During this time, Steve Smith was talking to the commentators from the field of play and he did not seem too pleased or in sync with his captain Ajinkya Rahane's decision to hand the ball to Gowtham in just the second over of the run chase. ""The spinner, I thought, just bowled too straight,"" said Smith to Simon Doull during the third over of the innings when Jofra Archer was bowling. Brett Lee then asked Smith whether he would have preferred attacking Narine with Archer's pace and bounce instead of Gowtham's spin. To this, Smith replied, ""Not sure, that's a question for Ajinkya [Rahane] I'd say. But he [Narine] sort of comes at it from ball one. I thought the spin over the wicket wasn't a great move as it was taking the stumps out of play."" Narine has a fantastic record against spinners in the powerplay since he reinvented himself as an opening batsman in the IPL. Here's the list of bowlers he's taken to the cleaners over the last couple of years. Thus, it was understandable why Smith did not seem happy with the choice of the bowler as it basically gave KKR the start they had desired. The 22-run over following the 10-run first over broke the back of the chase and ensured KKR romped home to 140 within 14 overs. Earlier in the day, Smith had top-scored for Rajasthan with 73 runs off 59 balls but that was not enough to help his team. Rajasthan Royals are now second last on the points table and will take on Chennai Super Kings next on April 11. Meanwhile, KKR will also play CSK in their next match which will be held at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on April 9.","

Both teams have blown hot and cold in this tournament and have mercurial players who can swing from brilliance to mediocrity with alarming alacrity. The match begins at 8 pm IST and at 2:30 pm GMT. Star Sports 1, Star Sports 2, Star Sports Select 1 and Star Sports Hindi 1 are the four SD channels that will telecast the game. In HD, you can choose between Star Sports HD 1, Star Sports HD 2, Star Sports Select HD 1 and Star Sports Hindi HD. Commentary in other regional languages will be available on Star's vernacular channels. Online streaming will be on Hotstar. The top-heavy batting line-up of Sunrisers is contrasted with a more even spread of quality in the Kings XI top-7. Ironically, spin could again be a key factor on a pitch that was once regarded as the most pacer-friendly wicket in India. Two canny seamers in Bhuvneshwar and Sam Curran may still make a difference. Though the former is yet to show the form which made him a top limited-overs bowler in world cricket. Chris Gayle came into IPL 2019 with the sort of form that sent shivers down the spine of bowlers. That is yet to be seen in this edition of the T20 tournament. The fact that the Mohali pitch tends to have a little bit of extra pace would suit the big Jamaican as he likes the ball coming on to the bat. Rashid Khan, too, is yet to find his groove for Sunrisers in this tournament. After a relatively quiet series against Ireland, Rashid is looking for a big effort in IPL. The presence of big-hitters like Gayle and Miller won't make his task easy. Bhuvneshwar hasn't had smooth sailing either. Coming on the heels of an underwhelming series at home against Australia, Bhuvi's form will be a serious concern for him but also Virat Kohli – though the latter is probably too pre-occupied with the travails of his own team. Mandeep Singh is a stylish batsman who would be at his home ground of Mohali. Once considered to be on the periphery of the Indian team, this Punjab player is yet to get a big break. Mujeeb-ur-Rahman eclipsed his more renowned teammate Rashid Khan in the recent series against Ireland. This match affords him an opportunity to overshadow his Afghani teammates, Rashid and Mohammed Nabi, on the biggest T20 stage in the world.","

537,2019-04-07,16:12:56,sports,indian-premier-league,Andre Russell will fail - Rajasthan Royals all rounder reveals plan to stop KKR star," Andre Russell has set the 2019 edition of the Indian Premier League on fire and made it his own little playground. Such has been the dominance of the big Jamaican that he has made actual cricket look easier than a video game. The all-rounder has almost single-handedly won three games for his franchise Kolkata Knight Riders but at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur, he might encounter a roadblock. After defeating Royal Challengers Bangalore in their fourth match of the season, KKR has a quick turnaround as they take on Rajasthan Royals just 44 hours later on April 7. Talking about the obvious threat of Russell, Rajasthan's spin bowling all-rounder Krishnappa Gowtham revealed that his team has made some plans to get the better of the most valuable player of IPL 2019. ""He has been in very good form. He has been hitting a lot of sixes and he is doing well for his team. We do have a plan set for him and hopefully it comes out,"" said Gowtham. The Rajasthan all-rounder is no alien to hitting a few long balls. Last season, he had single-handedly won Rajasthan a match at the death against Mumbai Indians by leveraging his long levers. In that game at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium, Rajasthan looked destined for defeat as they required 38 runs off 14 balls when Gowtham brought out the big shots and finished the game off with two balls to spare. The 30-year-old finished with 33 off 11 in that match in what was one of the most brutal cameos. This season, Russell has topped that and defied all definitions of impossibility as he chased down 53 runs off 3 overs on two separate occasions in the IPL. In KKR's first match of the campaign, the team looked in trouble while chasing 182 runs that SunRisers Hyderabad had posted at the Eden Gardens. But against one of the best collection of death bowlers the tournament had to offer, Russell plundered 40 runs off two overs from Sidharth Kaul and Bhuvneshwar Kumar. Finally, Shubman Gill launched two sixes off Shakib Al Hasan to notch up an improbable victory. In that match, Russell was initially struggling to time the ball but ended up with four sixes and four boundaries scoring 49 off 19. In the second match, he was given a life as Mohammed Shami bowled him with a perfect Yorker but only three fielders were inside the circle, which led to a no-ball being signalled. He subsequently scored 48 off 17 hitting three fours and fives sixes to propel KKR to 218 in 20 overs. In their third match, KKR was in trouble at 61-5, but a 28-ball 62 propelled them to 185 wherein they eventually lost in the Super Over. In their previous match, KKR chased down a record total of 206 against RCB to win and with 16 balls to spare, the match looked lost as the visiting team required 53 runs. Russell subsequently hit 7 sixes and one boundary to win the match in 11 balls. Russell currently has 207 runs at an average of 103.5 and a strike rate of 268.83 in IPL 2019. He has hit 22 sixes in 77 balls and opponents must find a way to stop him in order to stop KKR.","

The April 5 double-header features three former champions taking on each other in a bid to gain an early advantage in the congested points table. In the first match of the day, Chennai Super Kings will take on the returning homeboy Ravichandran Ashwin's Kings XI Punjab while the second game will see high-flying SunRisers Hyderabad host Rohit Sharma's Mumbai Indians. The match between CSK and KXIP will start at 4 pm local time and 10:30 am GMT meanwhile SRH versus MI will begin at 8 pm local time and 3:30 pm GMT. Both matches will be telecast on the Star Sports network – Star Sports 1, Star Sports 3, Star Sports Select 1 and their corresponding HD channels. Hotstar will provide the live streaming of the action in India. The two teams come into this game with opposing results in their previous encounter. While CSK suffered defeat at the hands of Mumbai Indians, courtesy a late Hardik Pandya onslaught; KXIP triggered a late Delhi Capitals collapse to notch up their third win of the campaign. In fact, CSK slipped to third place on the points table behind SRH and KXIP after Thursday's loss. Thus, MS Dhoni will be keen to get back on winning ways in the familiar locales of the MA Chidambaram stadium. KXIP will also fancy their chances on a pitch that assists spinners. Skipper Ashiwn, his namesake Murugan Ashwin, Mujeeb ur Rahman and Varun Chakravarthy will be licking their chops to cause havoc. CSK will be slightly worried about the fitness of Dwayne Bravo who suffered a hamstring injury in their defeat to Mumbai Indians. CSK Predicted XI: Shane Watson, Ambati Rayudu, Suresh Raina, Kedar Jadhav, MS Dhoni (C) (WK), Ravindra Jadeja, Mitchell Santner, Harbhajan Singh, Deepak Chahar, Mohit Sharma, Imran Tahir KXIP Predicted XI: Sam Curran, Lokesh Rahul (WK), Mayank Agarwal, Sarfraz Khan, David Miller, Mandeep Singh, Ravi Ashwin (C), Andrew Tye, Mohammed Shami, Mujeeb ur Rahman, Murugan Ashwin SRH is slowly becoming the team to beat in this season's IPL and sit on top of the points table, albeit courtesy a superior net run rate. Their foreign players have all come to the party and now it looks increasingly difficult to fit captain Kane Williamson in the playing XI. The opening duo of Warner and Bairstow has been a revelation on the flat Hyderabad track while the Afghani duo of Rashid Khan and Mohammad Nabi has also come to the party. Mumbai Indians, on their part, has started better than they usually do as they have equal number of victories and defeats in their opening four matches. But they will be coming up against a juggernaut as the only match SRH has lost was courtesy a mind-numbing innings from Andre Russell. MI certainly have such players in their ranks and Hardik played a similar innings to stop CSK in their last game. Thus, this game promises to provide a wonderful to an eventful Saturday. SRH Predicted XI: David Warner, Jonny Bairstow (WK), Manish Pandey, Vijay Shankar, Yusuf Pathan, Deepak Hooda, Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan, Bhuvneshwar Kumar (C), Sidharth Kaul, Sandeep Sharma MI Predicted XI: Rohit Sharma (C), Quinton de Kock (WK), Suryakumar Yadav, Yuvraj Singh, Kieron Pollard, Krunal Pandya, Hardik Pandya, Rahul Chahar, Mitchell McClenaghan, Jason Behrendorff, Jasprit Bumrah","

539,2019-04-05,23:50:02,sports,indian-premier-league,Andre Russell scripts miracle again for KKR vs RCB; Twitter calls him a God," At one point 53 runs were required off 16 balls and Russell then took over to hit 7 sixes and a boundary to finish the game off. With one run left to get in the last over, Russell sprinted through for the winning run as if he were a Jamaican sprinter and then punched his chest a few times.  It was a miracle and Russell is making it a habit to script miracles for KKR. On the night, the big Jamaican scored 48 runs from 13 balls. To recount Russell's innings since the 18th over, it was - dot ball, dot ball, six runs, six runs, six runs, one run, six runs, six runs, six runs, four runs, six runs.  Earlier in the evening, Dinesh Karthik won the toss and elected to bowl first. Virat Kohli and AB De Villiers helped the home team reach 205 and for most of the chase, it looked as though it would be enough for RCB to notch up their first victory of the tournament. But Andre Russell thought otherwise.  Russell was naturally delighted after the match and said that although it was an improbable situation, he was confident. ""I was confident when I went out to bat. DK was telling me to take a few balls to see how the pitch is behaving. I was watching in the dugout on TV and had a fair idea. When you need 68 off 20-odd balls, it doesn't happen everyday,"" said Russell. ""Need to put your body on the line. The nature of T20 is such that one over can change the momentum. That's why I never give up. A part of me was saying that the runs needed were too much but I wanted to fight and eventually, we won with five balls spare. The support is good from the boys and I am in a good space so that I can express myself. No ground is big enough for me I guess, I just trust my power. Hand-eye coordination is the key (for low full tosses) as they aren't easy to hit. I try short arm jabs as extending the arms can put you in trouble. Can't explain much, rather show that on the field,"" Russell concluded with a wide grin on his face.  This is how Twitter reacted to the carnage.

""There is no guessing there (about where they lost), the last 4 four overs that we bowled was just unacceptable. We needed to be more clever, nothing came off and we just cracked under pressure. That's been our story this season so far,"" said Kohli. ""If you bowl with not enough bravery in the crucial overs, it's always going to be difficult against power-hitters like Russell. I wasn't really happy getting out at that moment, could've got 20-25 more. AB didn't get much strike in the end. I thought the runs were enough on the board, we didn't have enough composure. If you can't defend 75 in the last four overs, then I don't know if you can defend 100. We can have a bit of chat about what went wrong, apart from that nothing much you can say. I don't think talking enough helps all the time. You need to give the guys some space and come back stronger in the next game. It's been a disappointing season so far, but we are still optimistic about our chances. We just have to believe in ourselves that we can turn things around,"" an extremely disappointed Kohli concluded. ","

540,2021-08-25,02:14:58,sports,football,"FIFAgate corruption scandal: Ex-employee pleads guilty, received over $350K in bribes; may get 20 years in jail [details]"," The FIFA bribery scandal of 2015 has taken down several former officials and has resulted in the arrests and convictions of many. On Monday, Reynaldo Vasquez, former president of the Salvadoran Football Federation (FESFUT), pleaded guilty for his participation in the corruption case dubbed 'FIFAgate'. Vasquez, 65, pleaded guilty in a US federal court to racketeering conspiracy, and his role in schemes to receive hundreds of thousands of dollars as kickbacks and bribes. He also agreed to forfeit multiple bank accounts and $360,000. Vasquez's sentence could see him put away for a maximum of 20 years. ""With today's guilty plea, Vasquez admits to engaging in a decades-long racketeering conspiracy to accept hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes and kickbacks that corrupted the game of soccer,"" said Jacquelyn M. Kasulis, Acting United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, in a statement. Extensive Bribes and Kickbacks The ex-football chief—who led FESFUT between 2009 and 2010—was initially arrested in December 2015 after being charged. He was serving an eight-year sentence for fraud in El Salvador when he was extradited to the US on 29 January 2021. After being found guilty by an internal ethics committee, FIFA banned Vasquez for life and fined him approximately $548,000 (500,000 Swiss francs) in October 2019. According to facts and filings presented in court during his plea proceeding, Vasquez along with his co-conspirators actively participated in corruption, nobbled a consortium of sports marketing companies and soccer organizing bodies. Through their alliance with the enterprise, Vasquez and others sought and received kickbacks and bribes in exchange for awarding profitable marketing and media contracts. In 2012, Vasquez and other former and existing officials of the federation gained around $350,000 in bribes. This was for the sale of marketing and media rights to World Cup qualifying matches—that was set to be played much before the 2018 World Cup—involving the El Salvador national team. This payment was sent from a sports marketing company's bank account in the US. Eventually, a portion of the bribe money was received by Vasquez via wire transfer made through the US. ""Over a period of many years, Reynaldo Vasquez corrupted the business of international soccer by requesting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes and kickbacks. IRS CI is committed to ending these practices and bringing corrupt officials to justice,"" stated Ryan L. Korner, Special Agent-in-Charge, Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI). Arrested and Convicted  However, Vasquez's involvement in corrupt practices did not end with World Cup matches. In 2014 and 2015, he and several other co-conspirators agreed to take thousands of dollars in bribes in connection with the Salvadorean national team's participation in friendly matches that were to be held in the US. He was finally arrested in 2015 after his involvement in the racket came to light. ""Mr. Vasquez didn't achieve his dream of wealth and power, and now he faces the possibility of many years in federal prison. Today's plea should demonstrate to others who attempt to corrupt international soccer - we play to win,"" declared Michael J. Driscoll, FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge, New York Field Office. Vasquez's guilty plea is a result of an extended multi-institutional investigation probing corruption in international soccer. So the prosecution has led to 27 individual guilty pleas, four corporate guilty pleas, and two convictions at trial, among other settlements. ","

541,2020-11-29,08:19:00,sports,football,Maradona stayed in Kannur hotel room 8 years ago; it's exactly as he left it," Who would have thought that a room in a four-star hotel located in the downtown coastal city of Kannur, Kerala, would have been transformed into a museum dedicated to soccer legend Diego Maradona, who met an unexpected death owing to cardiac arrest at the age of 60 this week. It is true that the news of the Argentine football legend's sudden demise has left a void among scores of fans across the globe. Malayalis, however, are cherishing the memories of the icon when he made a two-day visit to Kannur to promote a jewellery brand in 2012. The soccer legend had briefly put up at Hotel Blue Nile when he made a two-day visit to Kannur to promote a jewellery brand eight years ago. The footballer left the following evening after the photoshoot for the jewellery brand, the arrangement of which was made inside the hotel. The 'Maradona Museum'  The 309-numbered room of the hotel has been turned into a ""museum"" of sorts, replete with real-life memorabilia and the articles he used and left behind. Room number 309 is now known as 'The Maradona Suite'. Its proprietor, V Ravindran, said in an interview to ANI that he wanted to pay a tribute to his football idol. He added that a commemoration was also organised this week in memory of the football legend. The room has a photo of Maradona. The things he used during his stay has been framed and kept in the room. From the cigar he smoked to the newspaper, tea cups, bedsheet, the painting given to him by a fan and even the soap he used are kept in the room as his memory. Ravindran said back then he had brought a chef from Kochi to prepare food Maradona enjoyed, particularly Russian cuisine. Ravindran said, ""When Maradona arrived in Kannur on October 23, 2012, he was staying in room number 309. For two days, Maradona stayed in this room. Being fans, we ensured enjoyable stay. All things used by him back then are kept here in his memory."" ""Back then we didn't know it was Maradona who is coming to stay here. We were told a VVIP is visiting and a security check was carried out. They told us to make some corrections in the room and hall. We carried out the renovations. Later, we were told it was Maradona, and being an ardent fan of him we made sure that he enjoyed his stay here,"" he said. Maradona landed at the Kozhikode airport on October 23, 2012, and had arrived in Kannur in a chartered helicopter. Upon his arrival, the legend was welcomed with a bouquet and was felicitated with a ponnada or a golden shawl. His secretary and interpreter introduced Maradona to the hotel staff, before proceeding to his room where he was offered tender coconut water ""He had liked Kerala fish and loved the prawns we served,"" Ravindran added. Following the legend's demise, there is a renewed interest in the hotel with football fans dropping by to take a peek into the suite, while booking enquiries have ostensibly gone up, says Ravidran. During his visit to Kannur, the stadium in which Maradona participated in an event had witnessed a sea of people and the football legend had celebrated his 52nd birthday with them. Maradona captained Argentina to victory at the 1986 FIFA World Cup and was widely regarded as one of the greatest footballers of all time. Maradona had begun his professional career with Argentinos Juniors at the age of 16 and he went on to become one of the greatest players to ever play the game of football. He represented Boca Juniors, Barcelona, Napoli, Sevilla, and Newell's Old Boys as a player.","

542,2020-11-25,22:19:58,sports,football,Diego Maradona passes away at 60 due to cardiac arrest; the world mourns loss," Legendary Argentinian footballer Diego Maradona has passed away. The footballer who was recovering post a brain tumor surgery suffered a cardiac arrest on Wednesday. According to Argentinian media reports, the footballer died at around 09.30 PM IST. The footballer was aged 60. Maradona's death news comes just a few days after he celebrated his 60th birthday.  Post the surgery, Maradona had revealed that he was keeping well, and the footballer even shared some photos with his doctor.  It should be noted that Maradona has played a crucial role in determining the success of Argentina in the 1986 football world cup. Maradona also helped Argentina to reach the final of the 1990 football world cup as well.  Who was Diego Maradona? Born on October 30, 1960, in Lanús, Buenos Aires Province, Maradona started showing his footballing talents at the age of eight. After marking his presence felt in Boca Juniors and Barcelona, Maradona became a global figure during the 1986 world cup.  Diego who captained the Argentinian national side in 1986 single-handedly helped the country to win the world cup. In a team filled with average talents, Maradona shouldered the entire team alone, and even scored a goal with the hand, now popularly known as 'Hand of God'.  In 1990 too, Argentina was about to win the world cup as Diego helped the country to reach the finals. However, Maradona and his boys lost the title in between the cup and the lip, as Germany defeated them in a margin of 1-0.  In the 1994 world cup, Maradona played only two games, as he was sent home after failing a drug test for ephedrine doping. As Maradona failed the drug test, his international career was over. For Argentina, Maradona played 91 matches and scored 34 goals for the country.  Even though there are several other footballing legends including Pele, football fans have a special place for Maradona in their heart; all credit goes to his impeccable talent and that unflinching winning crave while being on the ground.  Football world weeps The death of Maradona was shocking and fans and celebrities are sharing their condolences on their social media pages.  It's very sad that the football legend Diego Maradona left us so prematurely .The ""hand of god"" passes into folklore .Deepest condolences. pic.twitter.com/rGfbPpdnDS Farewell legend. ? #DiegoMaradona RIP! ? pic.twitter.com/SybIe2ohaR RIP #DiegoMaradona.

Mohun Bagan have already become a part of the ISL this session by joining hands with ATK, an ISL franchise. And with Sree Cement joining East Bengal as their investor, the Red and Gold brigade is also set to join the ISL bandwagon. Bhaichung Bhutia on the entry of Mohun Bagan and East Bengal Bhaichung feels that it's a win-win situation for everyone. Speaking to IANS, the legendary footballer said, ""I think everybody will benefit from this association. East Bengal and Mohun Bagan need a platform like the ISL, and ISL also needs clubs like East Bengal and Mohun Bagan. These clubs have a huge fan base. So, to me, everybody is going to benefit. It's a win-win situation for everyone."" Setting aside the general perception that ISL organisers were reluctant to adopt these two big names in the ISL fold, Bhaichung said that it takes time to take a call on legacy clubs like East Bengal and Mohun Bagan. ""Adopting clubs like East Bengal and Mohun Bagan takes time. They thought it was not important initially, but I don't think the ISL management ever thought that they will not include East Bengal and Mohun Bagan. It was only a matter of time I guess,"" Bhaichung said. ""Every country needs a good league and good teams playing in it. And a good league with good teams will only help the development of football in the country,"" Bhaichung said. The former India skipper also feels that a professional body running the country's top league under the guidance of the national football federation is nothing new. This is happening all over the world. When asked about the country's top league being managed by a private body, the former India skipper said, ""I don't think so. The top leagues around the world are being managed by separate parties."" Bhaichung had earlier expressed his happiness over the fact that East Bengal have finally got an investor. ""I am very happy that finally East Bengal have got an investor and are hopeful of playing in the ISL this year. I am really happy for the fans. They have been praying to see East Bengal play in the top league,"" he told IANS earlier.","

The stakes are high for defending champions Liverpool who are primed to scale the summit again as the Reds square off with newly-promoted Leeds United in the season opener on Saturday. Premier League kicks off It would be interesting to see if Jurgen Klopp's men can maintain their stride and keep the Cup at Anfield for another season. Meanwhile, Leeds United's entry into the Premier League will be an extremely elating experience as the club returns to the league after a long gap of 16-years. Marcelo Bielsa's men took the football world by storm in the 2019-2020 season and will be looking to dish out a similar performance this season too. Frank Lampard's first full-fledged season as the manager ended with Chelsea finishing at the fourth spot in Premier League's 2019-20 season. With the transfer ban lifted, the Blues have put all their faith in the young guns. The entry of two new midfielders Kai Havertz and Hakim Ziyech have raised the bar for Chelsea and fans are eager to see what's up next for their favourite team. They are ably supported by new additions to the time in the likes of Timo Werner, Thiago Silva and Ben Chilwell. Previous season's star Christian Pulisic was among the only few players that were retained, but his return to the field is still uncertain owing to injury concerns. After a consecutive two-season win, Manchester City finished at second position in the 2019-20 season with an 18-point gap with Liverpool. A fresh campaign for Pep Guardiola will be a chance to introspect and work on Manchester City's weakness from last season, their defence. With newly-signed defenders, Napoli's Kalidou Koulibaly and Bournemouth's Nathan Ake making their position in the team, the world will be eager to see if Guardiola manages to sail the team to the crown. Manchester United has been reinvigorated with Bruno Fernandes' entry from Sporting Lisbon keeping the adrenaline pumping in all matches. With the new signing of Ajax midfielder Donny van de Beek, the team's midfield looks strengthened. To bridge the gap between Liverpool and Manchester City, United will have to retain their post-pandemic form and go on a winning spree. Meanwhile, Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal, Leicester City, Everton and Wolves will also pose serious challenges and fight for the top four spots. Arsenal's previous season comprised of a lot of hits and misses as the team finished at the eighth spot on the points table. With Mikel Arteta's new plan and with the expectation of Mesut Ozil, the playmaker's return, Arsenal will get an equal ground to prove themselves. Under the leadership of Jose Mourinho, the Spurs will look at moving forward on the points table. Brendan Rodgers' phenomenal management has brought Leicester City at such a comfortable position in Premier League and they have certainly attracted all the eyeballs for next campaign. Carlo Ancelotti should continue to improve Everton as he looks to be in charge for the full season. The Premier League season will be aired on Star Sports Network & Disney+ Hotstar VIP.","

Even after hanging his boots, Bhaichung Bhutia has been a role model to many and he will continue to inspire young footballers of India, let alone Sikkim. We can't repay him for what he has done for Indian football. But a stadium named after him might be a small homage towards the great footballer,"" Menla Ethenpa, President, Sikkim Football Association told www.the-aiff.com. Barring the Dr. Karni Singh shooting range in New Delhi and the stadiums named after iconic hockey duo -- Dhyan Chand and Roop Singh -- this is going to be the first-ever stadium in India to be named after any footballer. Meanwhile, Bhaichung, the first Indian footballer to play 100 international matches stated he is ""honoured"" as it's going to be the first-ever football stadium in India named after a footballer. ""I'm very much honoured and excited. If you look at the larger picture I'm happier because the budding footballers will get another top-class facility and infrastructure to play football. This stadium has produced many footballers including me. I have so many memories of playing there,"" Bhutia said. Groundwork of the stadium started in the 2010s before it faced many roadblocks owing to financial difficulties. After Prem Singh Tamang, current Chief Minister of Sikkim, assumed his office, the construction work resumed once again. ""Our Chief Minister is an avid football supporter and he himself took interest to fast-track the construction work. Had the COVID-19 pandemic situation not disturbed the entire scenario, the stadium could have been inaugurated already,"" Ethenpa informed further. The artificial turf has already been laid besides setting up the 15,000-capacity stands.

After a historic season, Bayern Munich defeated PSG 1-0 at the Estadio da Luz and crowned its impressive trajectory with the sixth UEFA Champions League title. However, soon after the match was over, more than 140 people were arrested as PSG fans set cars ablaze. Around 5,000 supporters had gathered at Paris's Parc des Princes to cheer on PSG, lighting flares and chanting as they watched the 1-0 defeat in Lisbon on a big screen. Following yesterday's scuffles at the ground, late-night clashes erupted on the Champs-Elysees, where vehicles were set on fire, windows broken and shops vandalised. Police said as many as 148 people were arrested during the night. And there were exchanges between fans and police outside the ground throughout the game, with youngsters armed with fireworks targeted with tear gas by police. Vehicles set on fire, police vans pelted with bottles Dustbins and a vehicle were set on fire, and police vans were pelted with bottles. Police cleared away 100 people who gathered at the Porte de Saint-Cloud area of the French capital, near the Parc des Princes stadium. The historic win: Bayern Munich vs PSG On the pitch on Sunday, the two coaches made changes in relation to the last game, with the Bavarian Hansi Flick going against expectations and selecting Kingsley Coman, who came from the PSG academy, in place of Ivan Perisic, reports Xinhua news agency. And as in a script worthy of the best films, it was precisely the French striker who was the executioner of the team that formed him for football with the title goal in the 14th minute of the second half with an accurate header after Joshua Kimmich cross. Before that, the game started a lot studied in the first minutes, with the two teams analysing the opponent, looking for the attack with great care, without taking risks until the first 15 minutes of the game. From there, what was seen was Bayern with greater possession of the ball and total control of the midfield against a PSG depending on long balls raised to the offensive sector to exploit any mistake by Bayern through the individual talent of their three front men: Neymar Jr, Kylian Mbappe, and Angel Di Maria. The Frenchmen's best chance was in the 17th-minute of the first half, with Neymar receiving the ball from Mbappe on the left side and hitting twice for the goal, for two great saves by goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. The Bavarian response came strong after 21 minutes when Robert Lewandowski received his back inside the area, spun on his own body and sent the ball over Keylor Navas' crossbar. From there, the two teams alternated attacks without real danger to the opposing goal and the first half ended with the Bayern players trying to influence the referee for a penalty, however, unlike the 1975 final, the referee refused to be swayed by the Bavarians. Bayern's dominance intensified at the start of the second half until, on 14 minutes, ex-PSG Kingsley Coman headed in, defining the final score. Bayern Munich still had a few more chances to extend the score, but all were contained by the defense led by defender Thiago Silva. PSG exchanged a few pieces and managed to create goal chances - all of them drowned out by Neuer, who made a game to go down in history. But the destination was already sealed and, after five minutes of extra-time, the party of the Germans from Bayern Munich started by raising their sixth ""eared"", being the first UEFA Champions League earner to win all the matches of the biggest European club tournament.

However, the announcement has not dampened the spirits of Indian national team players. Goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu has sounded out the mood for the rest of the team, making it clear that it is a very good decision, keeping the safety of the players in mind. 2022 FIF World Cup qualifiers rescheduled In a live chat with AIFF TV, Gurpreet said: ""I had a feeling about it. With the pandemic, it's not a very good situation -- to have a resumption of international football right now. It is important to have safety in mind,"" he stated. ""I'm raring to get back on the pitch. I can assure it's the same for the rest of the players too. I am raring to get back.

Midfielder Anirudh Thapa complemented Gurpreet highlighting ""health of players is of paramount importance"". ""My first thought after the announcement was that our wait to get back gets longer. But we need to think from a bigger perspective as well. Safety is important. I fully stand by the decision,"" Thapa stated.

But I think it's an extremely good decision. It's a bit of a catch-22 situation. We are all sorely missing out on being out there on the pitch, but on the other hand, we also have to take into consideration the safety of everyone involved in organising a match,"" said Adil. Adil's fellow defender Pritam Kotal also feels that there is a great risk to the players who have to travel to different venues in order to play. ""We all saw what happened with the Bangladesh players and the players of the Indian hockey team. Many of them tested positive. I think when you have this kind of a situation at hands, it is wise to delay international sporting events that can be held at a later stage. Not only do you lose a lot of players for some while because of the virus, but the safety of these players are also in doubt,"" said Kotal. With no football being played, the 27-year-old is now spending a lot of time collecting as much information about fitness as possible. ""I have been reading a lot about fitness. Normally I don't get the time to do so. But now that I have the time, I try to gather as much knowledge as possible - knowledge that will, later on, help me become a better player,"" Kotal informed.","

Furthermore, all government legislations will have to be followed.  The FA also issued a summary of key points in the guidelines: However, indoor football and Futsal is still not permitted and guidelines for indoor formats of the game are still being discussed.  James Kendall, Director of Football Development at The FA, said on the matter in the statement: ""We're delighted that the Government has given the go-ahead for competitive grassroots football to return.

""The first important camp is for U-16 boys who are around three months away from the AFC U-16 Championship,"" stated to AIFF TV. ""We are also conscious of the fact that the U-17 girls also need to start the camp as soon as possible,"" he said. AIFF to hold camps soon ""We have been in talks with various state governments as well as SAI (Sports Authority of India). Each state government has its own set of protocols to follow in terms of fighting the COVID-19 pandemic situation. Hopefully, we start both camps very soon. That's our endeavour,"" said Das. ""Some states are following a very rigid protocol, so we might need to shift to a different state in that case. We are in the process of doing that. Abhishek (Yadav) and myself have been working constantly on this,"" said the AIFF General Secretary. ""It's extremely frustrating but it's not only for me as the general secretary of AIFF, but for everyone. It's very disturbing that all planning processes have been interrupted because of the virus. ""The world has mostly come to a standstill. But there's nothing we can do about this. We have to survive this. Human beings are very resilient. It has impacted and disturbed a lot of activities not just in sports but everywhere. ""With regards to the senior men's team, our plan is to start the camp sometimes in early September. We want the camp in Bhubaneswar as the match against Qatar was scheduled there. We're in touch with the state government of Odisha as well as SAI. We are expecting to get a response from them. It's a very tricky situation but we need to come up with the best possible solution given the circumstances,"" he added. Under a normal situation, the junior teams would have been sent on a number of exposure tours to get them battle-ready for major tournaments like the AFC U-16 Championship or the FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup. While efforts still continue, exposure tours may not be a feasible solution keeping the safety of the players and the staff in mind. ""Yes it is a cause to worry. Before the COVID-19 outbreak, we had planned a lot of exposure trips which unfortunately are shelved now. I'm hoping that we can arrange some tours, especially for the U-16 team, at least one tour before going to Bahrain,"" Das maintained. ""But, at this point of time, it's very difficult to predict. It's definitely something to worry about. Even the other teams are also on the same boat. I guess it's the same situation for them. But I believe Uzbekistan, Australia and Korea Republic have already resumed training, so we also need to do that."" Incidentally, India U-16 have been clubbed in the same group with Korea Republic, Australia and Uzbekistan in the U-16 AFC finals. The general secretary informed that India U-17 Women's World Cup coach Thomas Dennerby was very satisfied with what was planned in the build-up to the preparation for the World Cup. ""The preparation for the U17 WWC was going very well. Our coach Thomas Dennerby was quite satisfied. He felt that going for the exposure trips would certainly add more experience to the team.

The 2016 ISL winner with ATK FC believes that this is a massive leap from the state of players in the country a decade ago and the monetary influx in India's premier league is only going to benefit the country's position in global football, much like it does with Europe's top leagues. Iain Hum on Indian Super League ""People say top European leagues are only money-driven but that's only because they are the best leagues in the world, if they were not, nobody would invest. It's the times we are in. Same for the ISL, to make a career out of football, you have to take the chances that come. If you get offered a big contract, you have to take it. I have witnessed this especially in India. It is giving a lot of young Indian players a chance to make a career out of football,"" Hume said in a Facebook Live with Sportskeeda. ""Indian players never used to have that opportunity. Even back as far as the first or the second ISL, players were finishing ISL, going and working in an office or a job. Now, they are getting the opportunity to play football for six-eight months of the season, and instead of going to the office, they can do coaching in an academy, there's that opportunity,"" he said. ""Although we speak of European football having far too much money, the ISL is at a point where they have money to be able to offer careers, rather than just eight months. I think that is perfect and that's the way to catch up with the rest of Asia and world football. It's brilliant the way they are doing it right now,"" added the Canadian striker, who is one of the most successful players in the history of ISL. Hume has turned out for three ISL clubs, namely Kerala Blasters, ATK and FC Pune City, and scored 28 goals in 69 appearances after spending most of his career in the Championship in England. The 36-year-old also is of the opinion that the ISL is moving progressively both financially and structurally which augurs well for Indian football.

I will train and play for my club Rangers FC once things open up after the lockdown and hope to be at peak fitness."" Apart from preparing herself for the Scottish Premier League season and upcoming national duties, Bala Devi has also taken up her time to support children in need, back in India. With over 33 million children being affected by child labour, Bala has taken up the cause to raise funds with the help of which, these children will be sent to schools and not work. ""I have experienced how the lack of amenities and access hampers the growth of children and becomes a barrier in them achieving their dreams,"" said Bala. ""It is prevalent all around us and everyone knows it. No child deserves to have to do that,"" she said. ""Children have their dreams, be it completing their education, or entering the world of sports. By sending them to work from such an early age, we only hamper that dream. I urge everyone to join in on this effort and help save our kids from child labour.""","

Indian goalkeeper Aditi Chauhan talks about the national team In a recent chat with AIFF TV, Aditi said: ""When I first started playing for the national team, it was majorly dominated by players from Manipur. But it has become more of a diverse team now."" ""The team has a lot of characters - a pan Indian representation which helps unify the team."" ""The unity in diversity is our core strength - the secret of our bonding. We are all together in the team with one mission - to represent the country. That is what defines us,"" she stated. ""We get to interact with lots of characters from whom we get to learn so much. Everyone has a different story to tell -- their journey, struggle, conditions at home, and much more."" Aditi also spoke about how women's football has adopted a more pan-Indian approach, pushing the quality Manipuri players for a slot in the squad. ""The competition for places in the team has grown - everyone is pushing each other. No one is comfortable as there are new kids coming from all over and securing slots in the squad. That's how the team has grown, and the results have come out so well."" The Delhi-based goalkeeper believes more ""younger girls"" will follow in the footsteps of Manipuri striker Bala Devi. Bala currently on a professional contract with Rangers FC is the first Indian woman footballer to sign a professional contract in Europe. ""Bala is a gem of a player and her move to Rangers is amazing,"" Aditi said. ""The standard of play, the culture is so different. It's a total professional set-up in Europe. The experience which she will gain will benefit not just her, but Indian Football in general,"" the Indian footballer explained. ""Whenever she comes back to play for the National Team, we'd eagerly wait to hear about her experiences. I am sure she'll love to share all of that - especially with the U-17 girls. Her knowledge will matter a lot shaping the career of younger girls,"" she opined. ""There's so much potential in India,"" Aditi informed. ""I want more girls to get such exposures, and learn from playing against better opponents. With more avenues for younger girls coming up, I am sure there will be others who will follow in Bala's footsteps.""","

It gives you an option to live a peaceful life, away from these hazards -- a reason to be proud of."" ""Parents provide pocket money to their wards for food, conveyance but they use them for drugs.

Indian footballer, goalkeeper Subrata Paul urged all to take up sports as a hobby. ""Nowadays in nuclear families, there isn't much bonding among the kids. Not everyone goes out and play.

In a petition signed by several players, it has been alleged that the UPFS has been 'hijacked' by a don-turned-politician, who is calling the shots from jail. Members of the probe team recently visited Varanasi, where the UPFS headquarters is and are likely to submit their report to the government soon. Probe initiated against UP Football Sangh In the past also, a few footballers had raised the issue with former Sports Minister Chetan Chauhan, but before he could intervene, he was shifted from the ministry. UP Sports Minister Upendra Tewari and Sports Director R.P. Singh, meanwhile, expressed their inability to deal with the 'football mafia'. ""This is the matter of the association. We cannot do anything,"" they said. The UPFS is still under the control of its former secretary Shamsuddin a.k.a. Babu Khan, who was arrested four years ago under POCSO Act for assaulting a minor female player. The victim has been fighting the case against Babu Khan, who is said to be close to an imprisoned mafia don-turned-politician. Babu Khan is presently out on bail. Last year, when the victim had held a protest at the office of the sports director here seeking action against her tormentor, she was threatened to withdraw her complaint. Another girl has also lodged a sexual harassment complaint in Varanasi, alleging that he attempted to molest her when she went to get her sports certificates. Later, following complaints by the player, the National Commission for Women (NCW) asked the Nadesar police in Varanasi to lodge a complaint against him. A state-level footballer, Mohit Singh, said that ""after facing sexual harassment charges, Babu Khan handed over reins of UPFS to his son."" Despite repeated attempts, Babu Khan could not be contacted for his version. Recently, in reply to an RTI query, the sports department has stated that in its records, the UPFS does not exist, while for over a decade it has been granting budgets and providing its best grounds to the association for holding tournaments.","

591,2020-05-29,20:31:05,sports,football,'We utter nonsense': Chhetri fears what fans might hear during closed-door games," The Bundesliga in Germany has resumed behind closed doors while both the Premier League in England and La Liga in Spain are working towards a return to action. Both these leagues could be played without fans in the stadium, which could be the norm for sports in the foreseeable future and might be the case in the upcoming Indian football season as well. India and Bengaluru FC captain Sunil Chhetri, however, feels that the first stage towards a resumption of sporting action after the lockdown is to ensure training restarts fully. Sunil Chhetri on football games in closed stadiums ""The Korean League and Bundesliga are checking every player every single day before he trains. When they go to the match, they have already been tested that they have no virus. But you never know, because some can be asymptomatic. That's why, for a second layer of protection, they are saying don't hug each other, don't spit and stuff like that,"" he said in a webinar hosted by non-profit organisation Yuva. ""But I think the first stage is training only. Matches are only once a week, but you train every day. It's going to be 30 players minimum, 12 coaches, a ball boy and a kit man. Everybody is going back home, and you don't know who they are meeting. You don't know who they are mixing with. But then again, you have to start,"" Chhetri added. Cricketers Rahul Dravid and Zaheer Khan, badminton star PV Sindhu and shooter Anjum Moudgil were other sports stars present in the webinar. Chhetri joked that the lack of fans in the stadium might expose the abusive language that football players use during matches. ""These superstars (Sindhu and Moudgil) play a game very nicely and they are very well-behaved, they don't abuse,"" Chhetri said. ""So if there are no fans, people will get to know our vocabulary of abuses. We utter nonsense, but we are allowed to say anything, except to the referee. We are dirty, we are ugly. If the fans are there, they are loud, and it (the abuse) all gets subdued. But if they're not there, my god..."" He explains. ","

The defending champions will be looking forward to register a win and extend their lead at the top of the table whereas the Los Pepineros would want to secure a win at home and save themselves from possible relegation. The Catalan club have not been in good form throughout this season. Even though they are at the top of the domestic league table but still they have been pretty much inconsistent through the season as they have already lost three of their La Liga matches. With Lionel Messi back in the squad after the 32-year-old playmaker recovered from injury, the Blaugrana's performance took a sharp turn and are getting their form back. Antoine Griezmann has not been upto the mark for the Catalan club this season after his arrival from Athletico Madrid. The Spanish club registered a massive victory in their last fixture against Celta Vigo with the Argentine playmaker scoring a hattrick. Ernesto Valverde, who is on the brink of getting sacked needs to prove a point with his strategical decisions as he has been heavily criticised for Barca's poor performance. The main concern for the Barca boss is his defence which has proved to be pretty much vulnerable and has conceded 15 goals this season. The Spanish club will definitely look forward to register a victory against the Los Pepineros and extend their lead over rivals Real Madrid before they play Borussia Dortmund in the UEFA Champions League at home on Wednesday. On the other hand, Leganes are in a pretty much bad situation as they are languishing at the bottom of the La Liga table. The Madrid-based club desperately need to register their second victory of the season to arouse some hopes of avoiding relegation. The Los Pepineros have won their match in this year's campaign against Mallorca at the end of October. Leganes will definitely want to produce an upset against the league leaders and get on the right track at home itself. Barcelona are the clear favourite to win this fixture on paper and considering current form. But the Madrid-based side can definitely produce an upset.

595,2019-11-10,11:10:29,sports,football,IB Times Special: Take a vivid tour of Alaves' home stadium Mendizorrotza [Video and pics]," In football the title of a historic club isn't something taken lightly. It refers to those clubs that have had, for many decades, behind them a long line of victories and defeats, but above all, a fan base that keeps that history alive. One such example earned the nickname El Glorioso (The Glorious) and when it clinched promotion back to the top flight of Spanish football, it signalled the return of one the nation's most historic clubs, D Alaves. With 95 years of history to their name, the Vitoria-based side are one of the most traditional clubs in La Liga. Alaves have enjoyed many seasons in the top-flight, including some in which the team competed with the best in Spain and Europe. The club is now heading towards their centenary year displaying all the characteristics that made them one of the greats: a recognisable brand of football, a devoted fan base and, of course, the legendary Estadio Mendizorrotza, or 'Mendi' as the fans affectionately call it. Alaves' home ground is the second oldest in La Liga Santander, having been inaugurated 95 years ago in 1924. Mestalla is the only top-flight stadium that has been around for longer. Having undergone renovations at various points, Mendizorrotza currently has a capacity of over 19,000 and anyone who believes Alaves are thinking about moving in the near future has another thing coming. The ground is currently undergoing works, including an extension that will be carried out over the coming months. The renovation is focused on appearance and capacity, with around 27,000 of the club's loyal fans set to be able to support the team once the works have been completed, which is a significant increase on 19,000. The approved plans catch the eye because an impressive stadium cover will be fitted once the extension has been finalized. Mendizorrotza will also look to cater to fans who are not purely after football by mirroring the model applied at many of the top grounds in Europe and creating a shopping and leisure facility, aimed at families, over an area of around 5,000m². The very ambitious project, which will also increase the range of services on offer in Vitoria, will give one of the oldest stadiums in Europe a facelift and prolong its life by many years. There is nothing quite like your team's home when it has been there your whole life, which Alaves fans know all about.","

The Catalan club who produced a splendid display in their previous match against Valladolid will look forward to continue their winning run whereas the Frogs will want to produce a major upset against the Spanish giants. The Catalan club after facing minor hiccups at the start of the season slowly steadied their ship and gradually went at the top of the La Liga Liga table as the season progressed. Ernesto Valverde's men had produced brilliant displays in their last eight outings in all competitions as they survived without conceding a defeat. With Argentine playmaker, Lionel Messi back in the squad the Catalan club will be raring to go against the Frogs to extend their lead at the top of the table over arch-rivals Real Madrid. Barca currently have 22 points in their kitty from the 11 matches they have played which is not that great compared to their past performances but with Messi back in the ranks of the Catalan club, the team are currently getting their form back. The 32-year-old playmaker has himself score four goals and provided three assists in the last three La Liga outings and in the fixture against Valladolid he was at his best form. The Spanish giants thumped Valladolid 5-1 to register their place at the top of the table. Luis Suarez has been also enjoying a goal-scoring spree and with Antoine Griezmann back in the squad, the trio can turn out to be a nightmare for the Valencia-based club. But the defence of the Spanish club has been a major concern for Valverde and he needs to get things right to make sure that they do not concede any goals. The Catalan club have conceded 11 goals this season in the same number of matches they have played in the La Liga. Barcelona will definitely look forward to register a win and stay high on confidence before they face Slavia Praha in their fourth UEFA Champions League fixture of the season. On the other hand, Levante who are currently placed 10th on the domestic league table have been in decent form this season. They have registered four wins, two draws, five defeats and are coming into this match after a 2-1 away victory at Real Sociedad on Wednesday. The Frogs started the season pretty well before facing a defeat against Real Madrid. They will be aiming for a top-10 finish this season after they finished 15th in the last two seasons. Paco Lopez's men will be looking forward to produce a major upset like they did last season when they defeated Barcelona 5-4 on home soil. Their defence will have their work cut out to restrict Messi and company. It will be a major task for Lopez's men to overcome the challenge of the Spanish giants but they will look forward to doing so and keep their domestic campaign on track. The Catalan club are the favourite to win the match according to their recent performances and line-up. But the Frogs can produce an upset like they did last year and put a halt to the Spanish giants' winning run. The probable scoreline of the match will be 4-1 in favour of Barcelona. The Barcelona-Levante match will start at 4 PM local time and 8.30 PM according to IST on November 2. The match will not be telecasted in India as Sony Sports network did not get the broadcasting rights. The fixture will be streamed live on the official La Liga page on Facebook.","

The game's tactics, shirts and club badges come and go, as do the stadiums. Concerning the latter, one of the best examples of how to transform a footballing venue with the aim of bringing the team and fans even closer together can be found in the city of San Sebastian, northern Spain. Anoeta, home of Real Sociedad, is heading towards the final stage of its evolution and is one of the biggest sources of pride for the Txuri-urdin (blue and white) club. Since its opening in 1993, Anoeta - which replaced the legendary Atotxa - has been renowned for being one of the most modern stadiums in La Liga Santander. Famous for its imposing exterior architecture, the home of the Donostia-based club, in the past, didn't manage to capture the magic of its predecessor, the hallowed ground where the club famously won LaLiga titles. In the words of club president Jokin Aperribay, ""The root cause of the need to redevelop Anoeta was the fact that it used to have athletics track between the pitch and the stands,"" he notes. ""We want to do what the fans want us to do and make Anoeta one of the most renowned stadiums in La Liga, one which helps spread our message all over the world."" The stadium's redevelopment was a formidable challenge which involved fusing two different architectural styles together - maintaining much of the open structure of the previous incarnation of Anoeta, that blessed it with magnificent natural light, while also bringing the stands nearer to the pitch in order to make fans feel closer to the action, something which the players will also appreciate. From the outside an illuminated translucent ""skin"" will radiate in the club's famous blue colour, which in turn will give fans a view of the cityscape from inside the stadium. Anoeta is a new concept of a sports facility that puts it up there with the best stadiums in the world, equipped with the latest technology and unprecedented connectivity for all involved. Yet the new Anoeta not only aims to improve fans' match-day experience, but also seeks to strengthen the relationship between the club, the stadium and the city. Once fully redeveloped, the new Anoeta will be innovative, not only in its facilities but also in its use. It will become a true emblem of the city, just as the Beach of La Concha, the Old Town and the Kursaal are. In addition to welcoming in other sports, the club aims to provide different uses for each of the areas of the building, for leisure, start-ups and more. In the words of the architect Izaskun Larzabal: ""This has to be everyone's home"". Consequently, every txuri-urdin fan is rubbing their hands in anticipation of seeing the new Anoeta in its complete guise, which, unlike the old incarnation will be capable of matching the magic of the mythical Atotxa. Or who knows, maybe it will even be capable of surpassing it.","

598,2019-10-15,18:26:07,sports,football,"India Vs Bangladesh, FIFA World Cup Qualifier 2022: Preview, Live Streaming and where to watch"," The Indian football team will fight it out against Bangladesh in their third fixture of the 2022 FIFA World Cup Qualifiers at the Salt Lake stadium in Kolkata on October 15. The Men in Blue who rallied to hold Asian champions Qatar in the previous fixture of the qualifiers will be high on confidence whereas the Red and Green brigade who suffered a loss at the hands of Qatar last week will be looking forward to bounce back and stay on the race of a World Cup berth. The Blue Tigers lost their first encounter of the qualifiers against Oman which was a close affair. They then drew first blood in the match as Sunil Chhetri scored the goal but at the dying end of the match conceded two goals which cost them the match. The fitness of the players has raised many questions as the footballers donning the blue jersey of Team India were left panting as they could not match up to to the pace of the strikers of Oman in the final quarter of the match. In the second fixture of the qualifier, the Indian team achieved a historic feat by holding a much higher ranked Qatar side to a goalless draw. But their over-dependency on Chhetri came out into the open as the Indian captain was out of the match which resulted in a much lesser number of chances created in front of the goal. In the fixture against Bangladesh, the Men in Blue suffered a huge blow as defender Sandesh Jhingan has been ruled out of the match due to an injury but the positive thing for Team India is that Sunil Chhetri is back in the line-up. Head coach Igor Stimac will look forward to a better performance from the team in the final quarter of the match during which the Indian players have faltered gifting away matches in recent times. India are currently fourth on the table and if they want to qualify for the next stage of the qualifiers then they definitely have to win this fixture. On the other hand, the Bangladeshi team lost 2-0 to Qatar last week but showed some promise in certain periods of the fixture. They knocked the doors of the Qatar defence a few times with their fast moves and did not let the defenders of the Asian champions enjoy a light day at the office. The Red and Green brigade have the ability to produce an upset and they will definitely want to register their first victory of the qualifiers. The Blue Tigers are definitely the favourite to win the match at home with a 60,000 plus crowd backing them at the Salt Lake stadium. Moreover, on paper also the Indian team are a much superior side. But Bangladesh can definitely produce an upset and put an end to the World Cup hopes of the hosts. The result of the match will probably be 3-0 in favour of India. The India-Bangladesh match will start at 7.30 PM IST on October 15. The match will be broadcast by the Star Group in India. The fans will be able to see the match live on Star Sports 3 and live streaming will be available on Hotstar.","

599,2019-10-09,19:11:26,sports,football,"EXCLUSIVE | Take a visually sumptuous tour of Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan Stadium, home of Sevilla FC [Video and Pics]"," With the exception of the famous April Fair, there are few places in the city of Seville capable of congregating thousands of people to sing in unison with such passion. One of them is the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan stadium. Before kick-off, the Sevilla fans join together in a love song dedicated to their team to the cry of ""Sevilla, Sevilla, Sevilla"" – the climax of the age-old club anthem, rated by France Football as one of the best five in the world. In spite of the big European nights which the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan has hosted this century, there is one clash every season which eclipses all others played at this ground: The local derby which pits the city's two clubs, Sevilla FC and Real Betis, against each other. Played for the first time in La Liga's 1935/36 season, it is a match which extends beyond the realms of sport and defines the character of the Andalusian capital. During the week prior and on the days following, there is no other topic of conversation to be heard in homes, bars and marketplaces. For the fans of both teams, winning this match gives them bragging rights as champions of the city. As an interesting aside, it is worth noting that this rivalry extends to the so-called ""Water Derby"", a boat race held every year since 1970 on the Guadalquivir, the river which carves the city into two, and in which oarsmen from different boat clubs fight for the colours of Sevilla and Betis. Since it was opened in 1958, the Sanchez-Pizjuan has provided the backdrop to emotionally supercharged moments. Among them, the death of the player Antonio Puerta in a match in August 2007, which rocked Spanish football and turned the academy player into a club symbol, is remembered by Sevilla fans in every game with a huge ovation in the 16th minute in honour of his shirt number. A talismanic stadium for the Spanish national team, where La Roja have remained unbeaten in the 25 matches they have played here, the Sanchez-Pizjuan has borne witness to the history of Sevilla FC. It is home to a club which, as is spelled out on the stands, is characterised by class and courage.","

600,2022-03-31,09:41:25,sports,cricket,IPL: Royal Challengers Bangalore win low-scoring thriller by 3 wickets against Kolkata Knight Riders," In a see-saw, low-scoring thriller in IPL 2022, where bowlers called the shots, Royal Challengers Bangalore defeated Kolkata Knight Riders by three wickets at DY Patil Stadium on Wednesday. After bowling out Kolkata for just 128, Bangalore lost their first three batters in power-play. But critical knocks from Sherfane Rutherford (28), David Willey (18), Shahbaz Ahmed (27), Dinesh Karthik (14 not out) and Harshal Patel (10 not out) took Bangalore home with four balls remaining. Kolkata drew first blood on just the third ball as Umesh Yadav cramped Anuj Rawat for room, leaving the youngster to poke at it and the edge was snapped by the keeper flying to his left. Virat Kohli hit Yadav for sweetly-timed boundaries through cover point and mid-wicket to get going. Faf du Plessis slammed Tim Southee over cover. But on the very next ball, du Plessis closed the bat face too early and the leading edge flew to point. Kolkata's roaring start continued as Kohli flirted with a ball outside the off-stump off Yadav and nicked behind to keeper. Rutherford and Willey revived Bangalore's chase after the early strikes. The duo absorbed the pressure and got boundaries when the ball was there to be hit. The 45-run partnership off 53 balls ended when Willey chipped straight to mid-wicket off Narine. Rutherford got a boundary off Chakravarthy while Ahmed smacked Andre Russell with sixes over deep mid-wicket and deep square leg. Ahmed danced down the pitch to hit Chakravarthy over deep mid-wicket. But on the very next ball, Chakravarthy had the last laugh as Ahmed was beaten by flight and turn to be stumped by the keeper. Rutherford's innings ended when Sheldon Jackson grabbed the inside edge by diving to his right and grabbing it with his right hand off Southee's bowling. Wanindu Hasaranga hit a boundary but miscued loft on the next ball to mid-off. Patel scooped a boundary off Venkatesh Iyer and whipped past long-on while Karthik, who survived a run-out chance, pulled Russell over deep square leg and finished off the chase with a gorgeous straight drive to open Bangalore's account in the points table. Earlier, Kolkata's batting order were the masters of their own downfall. In a quest to hit hard against anything coming their way, they fell while attempting to play extravagant strokes instead of adjusting to the match situation. Bangalore's seamers found the perfect length on a tacky pitch: just short of a good length with extra bounce coming to the fore. Kolkata lost openers Venkatesh Iyer and Ajinkya Rahane in power-play. While Iyer tried to nudge a short of length delivery from Akash Deep to the leg-side, only for the top-edge to be pouched by the bowler running to his left, Rahane mistimed the pull on a short ball from Mohammed Siraj straight to deep square leg. Deep's pacy short ball, with some away nip, claimed Nitish Rana as a miscued heave over leg-side was snapped by Willey running back from backward square leg and making a slide to complete the catch in the final over of power-play. Kolkata's troubles increased as Shreyas Iyer holed out to long-on off Hasaranga. Sunil Narine produced some fireworks by smacking Deep for a four over mid-off and six over keeper's head. But an ugly hook to a straight ball saw Narine miscue to backward point off Hasaranga in the ninth over. On the very next ball, Hasaranga castled Sheldon Jackson with a beautiful googly. Russell, though, had other plans. He began by slog-sweeping Hasaranga over deep mid-wicket. Patel struck on the fourth ball of his night, forcing Sam Billings to hit his slower short of length ball straight to long-on. Russell then punished Ahmed with sixes over deep mid-wicket and long-off. But Patel frustrated Russell with four dot balls and on the fifth ball, the pacer had his man as the big-hitting right-hander tried to hit a short ball outside off-stump through off-side, but got an edge behind to Karthik. Hasaranga scalped his fourth wicket as Southee holed out to long-on. Yadav and Chakravarthy got a couple of boundaries to take Kolkata past 120. Yadav smacked Deep for a six and four before the pacer ended the 27-run stand by uprooting his leg-stump with a yorker. Brief Scores: Kolkata Knight Riders 128 all out in 18.5 overs (Andre Russell 25, Umesh Yadav 18; Wanindu Hasaranga 4/20, Akash Deep 3/45) lost to Royal Challengers Bangalore 132/7 in 19.2 overs (Sherfane Rutherford 28, Shahbaz Ahmed 27; Tim Southee 3/20, Umesh Yadav 2/16) by three wickets. Kolkata Knight Riders' skipper Shreyas Iyer felt extremely proud of his team for taking the match against Royal Challengers Bangalore till the final over. In a low-scoring IPL 2022 thriller, Kolkata tried to defend a paltry score of 128 but were unable to do so despite taking three wickets in first six overs as Bangalore completed the chase with four balls to spare. ""I really found this game exciting. Before getting in, I spoke with my boys and told them that this game is going to define our character and attitude on the field no matter we defend or not. The way we fight it on the ground, that is really going to reflect our mentality in the next few games. I am really proud of the way we played this game and took it till the last over,"" said Iyer after the match. Iyer was appreciative of Bangalore strategising their chase very well. ""It was really tough at that moment because I wanted to get my best bowlers up there and get a few wickets early on but it didn't work out really well. Kudos to their batsmen, they played really well out in the middle. They took out the toughest phase as soon as possible."" Asked on why he handed over 19th over duties to Venkatesh Iyer's part-time pace, Iyer explained, ""In the end, I decided to go with Venky because he's also got really good experience bowling at international level and you need to back them especially at the start of the tournament. It's really important they gain confidence as early as possible and this was one of the best games to get that."" Iyer admitted that Kolkata's batting didn't execute the slam-bang style against Bangalore but vowed to come back stronger in the next match.  Iyer signed off by speaking highly of leg-spinner Wanindu Hasaranga's spell of 4/20.

602,2022-03-28,11:24:58,sports,cricket,IPL 2022: New captain Du Plessis blitz goes in vain as Punjab beat RCB by 5 wickets," Faf du Plessis blistering knock went went in vain as Punjab Kings batters showed their power-hitting ability and hammered Royal Challengers Bangalore by five wickets in a high scoring 3rd match of the IPL 2022 at DY Patil Sports Academy, here on Sunday. After being invited to bat first, skipper Faf du Plessis (88 off 57), Virat Kohli (41 not out off 29) and Dinesh Karthik (32 not out off 14) powered Royal Challengers Bangalore to 205-2 in 20 overs. Chasing a huge target, openers Mayank Agarwal and Shikhar Dhawan gave Punjab a solid start. Both Mayank and Shikhar looked in solid touch and played some glorious shots, taking Punjab to 64/0 after 6 overs. With things looking good for Punjab, RCB skipper Plessis brought Wanindu Hasaranga into the attack and he dismissed Mayank (24)in his first ball of the season. Bhanuka Rajapaksa then joined Dhawan at the crease and both kept the momentum going. Sri Lankan Rajapaksa, who was playing his debut IPL match, targeted his countryman Hasaranga for a six and a four and took 13 runs off the over. The run-feast continued as both Rajapaksa and Dhawan smashed pacer Akash Deep for 19 runs and took Punjab for 116/1 after 11 overs. The pair added 47 runs for the second wicket before Harshal Patel provided RCB with their second breakthrough, removing Shikhar on 43. Thereafter, it was Rajapaksa and Liam Livingstone's responsibility to keep Punjab in the run chase and continued that with hitting regular boundaries. But Siraj stalled Punjab's charge in the 14th over by picking up the wickets of the dangerous Rajapaksa (43) and Raj Bawa (0) in successive deliveries. Liam Livingstone (19 off 10) was also in attacking mode and played some glorious shots before getting out to Akash Deep courtesy a stunning catch by Anuj Rawat. However, the power-hitting didn't stop from Punjab as lower down the order Shahrukh Khan (24) and Odean Smith (25) played some lovely strokes, remained unbeaten and helped Punjab chase down the target with one over to spare and five wickets in hand. Mohammed Siraj was the highest wicketer as well as most expensive bowler for RCB with his figures of 2/59. Earlier, openers Faf du Plessis and Anuj Rawat gave RCB a good start. Playing their debut match for the franchise, both batters played some good shots, hit few boundaries and took RCB to 41-0 at the end of 6 overs.However, Rawat could carry his innings longer after the powerplay and was cleaned up by Rahul Chahar. The southpaw, who was looking to take the attack to the PBKS bowlers, missed a slog sweep and got out after scoring 21 off 20. The wicket brought former RCB skipper Virat Kohli at the crease. The star batter took some time to assess the condition while Chahar created some trouble for du Plessis in his over. After a few quiet overs, Kohli decided to break the shackles and charged down the track and smashed Harpreet Brar for a six over the long-on fence. Soon, Du Plessis also changed his gears and smashed Odean Smith for 23 runs in the 13th over. During the process, the South African also scored his first fifty as a RCB player and captain. Both Faf and Kohli then combined to hit three sixes in spinner Harpreet Brar and as RCB raced to 136/1 after 14 overs. The pair of Kohli and Du Plessis kept the scoreboard ticking as they dealt in both boundaries and running between the wickets. Continuing his aggressive approach, Faf du Plessis hit Sandeep Sharma for 10 runs as RCB looked set for a big total. With only three overs to go, the Faf du Plessis show finally came to an end as he was caught at long-off by Shahrukh Khan off Arshdeep Singh's bowling. Du Plessis departed after scoring 88 off 57 and stitched an 118 stand for the second wicket with Kohli. Thereafter, Dinesh Karthik joined Kohli and he immediately took over from where Faf left. The wicket-keeper batter along with Kohli took Odean Smith to cleaners as 18 runs came off from the penultimate over of the innings. Continuing his onslaught, Karthik also hit Sandeep Sharma for two boundaries and one six and helped RCB finish at 205-2 in 20 overs. For Punjab Kings, Rahul Chahar (1/22) and Arshdeep Singh (1/31) took a wicket apiece.

603,2022-03-13,21:42:35,sports,cricket,Rishabh Pant breaks Kapil Dev's 40-year-old record; smashes fastest Test fifty by Indian batter," Adding another feather to his cap, Rishabh Pant on Sunday scripted history after hitting the fastest-ever half-century (50 off 28) by an Indian batter in the longest format of the game on the second day of the second and final Test (pink ball game) against Sri Lanka at the Chinnaswamy Stadium, here on Sunday. Pant came in and unleashed fireworks straight away and took the pitch out of the equation with an attacking approach and demoralised the Sri Lankan bowlers. The wicket-keeper batter smashed seven boundaries and two sixes to reach the half-century mark in just 28 balls and break the legendary Kapil Dev's 40-year-old record. Kapil Dev's Test fifty record Kapil had scored a 30-ball 50 in the 1982 Test match against Pakistan in Karachi and is followed by Shardul Thakur, who had scored a 31-ball half-century in the Oval Test against England in 2021, and former India cricketer Virender Sehwag, who had scored a 32-ball 50 against England in Chennai. Former Pakistan cricketer Misbah-ul-Haq (21 balls) has the record of smashing the fastest fifty in Test cricket history. He achieved the feat against Australia in Abu Dhabi in 2014. Courtesy Pant's attacking fifty, India reached 199/5 in their second innings at the dinner break and extended their lead to 342 runs against Sri Lanka on the second day of the second Test at the Chinnaswamy Stadium. Resuming their second innings from 61-1, India added 138 more runs in 29 overs at a rate of 4.76 and lost the wickets of Rohit Sharma (46), Hanuma Vihari (35), Virat Kohli (13), Rishabh Pant (50) in the second session of Day 2. Earlier in the day, Sri Lanka could add only 23 runs more to their overnight score as Jasprit Bumrah took a historic five-for (5/24) to help India bowl out the visitors for 109 in their first innings. It was Sri Lanka's second-lowest total (109) in Tests against India, with the previous being 82 all out in Chandigarh in 1990. (With inputs from IANS)","

605,2022-03-12,16:12:33,sports,cricket,Jhulan Goswami becomes leading wicket-taker in the history of Women's Cricket World Cup," Veteran India pacer Jhulan Goswami on Saturday added another cap to her glittering career. In India's third match of the ICC Women's Cricket World Cup against the West Indies, Jhulan became the leading wicket-taker in the history of the Women's Cricket World Cup by dismissing the West Indies spinner Anisa Mohammed. Anisa flicked to mid-wicket fielder, becoming Jhulan's 40th overall scalp in the tournament and was able to overtake Australia's Lyn Fullston's record since 1988 of 39 wickets at an average of 11.94. Almost 17 years ago, Goswami took her first World Cup wicket, dismissing Inoka Galagedara of Sri Lanka on March 22, 2005. Since then, she has dismissed 40 different batters, never getting the same batter out twice at a World Cup, with Anisa her seventh victim from the West Indies. That first wicket back in 2005 may have been the only scalp she took in her debut World Cup match, but it was the first and only time she would end with an economy lower than one. ""What an amazing achievement for @JhulanG10 to become the highest wicket-taker in @cricketworldcup. Goes to 40 wickets and not done yet!! So happy for her,"" former Australian cricketer Lisa Sthalekar tweeted. Jhulan produced figures of eight overs, three maidens, five runs, and one wicket, and she was just getting started, taking 13 wickets in the 2005 tournament in South Africa, her highest at a single World Cup. The 2009 World Cup was less fruitful, taking just four wickets but her best performance came against hosts Australia in the third-place play-off, dismissing opener Leah Poulton and tailender Rene Farrell for figures of two for 21 as India won by three wickets. After taking nine wickets on home soil in 2013, Jhulan was back in the double figures in 2017 as India lost out to England by nine runs in the final. The 39-year-old took three for 23, one of two times where she has taken three wickets in an innings to move to 10 for the tournament. Her highest wicket haul came in 2005 as she produced figures of four for 16 against the West Indies only four days after delivering four for 27 against England. Anisa's dismissal on Saturday takes Jhulan to 14 dismissals caught by fielders while seven have been caught by the wicket-keeper with five coming leg- before wicket. Fortunately for India, usually if Jhulan is taking wickets, they will win the game with 27 of her previous 39 wickets coming in wins, 11 in losses and one in a no-result, that very first wicket. Now with the win over West Indies at Seddon Park, India's next match in the World Cup will be against defending champions England on Wednesday at Bay Oval in Mount Maunganui, Tauranga.","

While many expressed their shock on Twitter, cricket fans have mourned the loss of the legend.","

According to cricketpakistan.com.pk, Shehzad, an all-rounder, had registered some impressive performances in the U-19 World Cup, scoring 166 runs in six innings and picking up a five-for against Papua New Guinea, conceding only seven runs. ""The technical committee approved of the replacement and Shehzad is likely to join the squad on Sunday,"" the report said.

Faulkner exposes PCB The 31-year-old took to Twitter and revealed that the PCB has ""continued to lie"" to him and that the treatment he received from the board and the PSL was a ""disgrace"". ""I apologise to the Pakistan cricket fans, but unfortunately, I have had to withdraw from the last two matches and leave the PSL due to the @TheRealPCB not honouring my contractual agreement/payments. I've been here the whole duration and they have continued to lie to me,"" said Faulkner in a tweet. ""It hurts to leave as I wanted to help get international cricket back in Pakistan as there is so much young talent and the fans are amazing. But the treatment I have received has been a disgrace from the @TheRealPCB and @thePSLt20. I'm sure you all understand my position,"" he added in another tweet.

This is where the journalism has gone."" Saha dropped from Test squad Saha's tweet came after he was excluded from the Test squad for the two-match Test series against Sri Lanka in March alongside Ajinkya Rahane, Cheteshwar Pujara and Ishant Sharma. During a virtual press conference, chief selector Chetan Sharma was asked about why Saha was not in the Test squad. ""I can't tell you on what grounds he has been dropped. That is for the selectors only. All I can tell you is that he was told before and was asked to play the Ranji trophy, which is the ladder for playing international cricket. What we discussed between ourselves (committee members); we can't tell you that."" Sharma further refused to get into the details of why Saha skipped Bengal's matches in the ongoing Ranji Trophy due to personal reasons. ""The CAB, state cricket association can tell you why because that isn't my jurisdiction. This selection committee believes that unless you are unfit, under load management or busy with international cricket, you should play in domestic cricket. That is very important. How will we know if you are match-ready?"" ""If one doesn't want to play, then the selection committee won't interfere in state matters. You need to ask Hardik why he isn't playing in Ranji Trophy. We are looking at the ones who are playing the Ranji Trophy and we get happy in seeing the performers play in Ranji Trophy."" Sharma had brushed aside the fact that age was the reason behind Saha's exclusion from the Test squad. ""We don't give much importance to age but at one point, the selectors start to think when you get some youngsters outside and want to give them a chance."" ""That is why selection committee said that you won't be considered for two matches. The doors are open for you. If you haven't played for long, how will we see the skills of you? This is why playing Ranji Trophy gets important for all and I am consistently emphasising on that."" (With inputs from IANS)","

The 41-year old represented India in 103 Tests, 236 ODIs and 28 T20Is, picking up 417, 269 and 25 wickets respectively. His overall tally of 707 international wickets is the second-highest for India, behind Anil Kumble's 953. He was also a handy contributor with the bat, scoring 3,569 runs with two centuries and nine fifties. Harbhajan, who became the first Indian to take a hat-trick in Test cricket -- against Australia at Eden Gardens in 2001 -- took to social media to announce his retirement. ""All good things come to an end and today as I bid adieu to the game that has given me everything in life, I would like to thank everyone who made this 23-year-long journey beautiful and memorable. My heartfelt thank you, Grateful,"" he wrote on Twitter. Harbhajan's cricket journey Harbhajan made his Test debut against Australia in Bangalore back in 1998 and Greg Blewett turned out to be his maiden Test scalp. In the same year, he earned his maiden ODI cap when India played against New Zealand in April in Sharjah. Matt Horne was his first ODI wicket. ""There comes a time in your life when you must make some tough decisions and move ahead. I have been meaning to make this announcement for the last few years, but I was waiting for the right moment to share it with all of you: today, I am retiring from all formats of cricket,"" the veteran said on his YouTube channel. ""In many ways, I had already retired as a cricketer, but hadn't been able to make a formal announcement. I haven't been an active cricketer for a while. But I had a commitment to Kolkata Knight Riders, and wanted to spend the (2021) IPL season with them. But during the season itself, I had made up my mind to retire,"" he added. The legendary off-spinner last turned out for India in March 2016, in a T20I against the UAE in Dhaka in that year's Asia Cup. In an international career that lasted from 1998 to 2016, the veteran cricketer had some memorable moments and was a part of the 2007 T20 World Cup and 2011 World Cup-winning squad. Harbhajan has had great success in the IPL too, taking 150 wickets in 163 matches, fifth on the all-time list. His best season in the IPL came in 2013 when he took 24 wickets at an average of 19 for the Mumbai Indians. He made his first-class debut in the 1997 season for Punjab versus Services, also played 198 first-class matches, snaring 780 wickets. ""It has been a beautiful journey over 25 years, right from the gullies of Jalandhar to becoming the Turbanator of India. Nothing has been more motivating for me than stepping out on the field while wearing the India jersey,"" the cricketer said. ""Like every (Indian) cricketer, even I wished to bid goodbye in an India jersey, but fate had something else in store for me. Irrespective of the side I represented, I have always given my 100 percent commitment to ensure my team finishes on top -- whether it was India, Punjab, Mumbai Indians, CSK (Chennai Super Kings), KKR or the county teams of Surrey and Essex,"" he concluded.

611,2021-11-19,15:08:08,sports,cricket,CLOSE-IN: T20 World Cup format needs a radical change," The announcement of the T20 World Cup schedules and format to be held in Australia in October/November 2022 requires a radical change. Maybe it is late to do so, but the ICC have to seriously look into it as well as into their other upcoming World cricket tournaments, to make them more competitive amongst the teams that count. The format announced has been finalised with 16 teams in the fray to finally settle on 12. The T20 WC 2021 tournament has clearly indicated that the minnow sides are still way below the qualifying mark at present to compete against the top cricket teams. Although, one understands the importance of spreading cricket far and wide, the matches turn out to be a complete farce. This may extend the tenure of the tournament, but it significantly reduces the quality of it. The formation of two groups and then for the two top teams of the groups to qualify is a concept that is ancient. This was a format when cricket World Cup ties came into existence -- one that was followed in 1975 and in 1979. It was in the World Cup of 1983 when ICC realised their folly and teams although grouped, played each other twice. This gave teams a chance to recover even if they had lost a match. India may not have qualified to win the World Cup, if the earlier format had been followed. The ICC seems confused about their approach. On one hand they are trying to increase participation, while on the other hand they seem to be in a hurry to complete their tournaments in what one can term as ""to tick the box"". The World Test Championship was a good example of it. How can one recognise a true winner if all the top Test-playing sides have not played against each other? The paucity of time and scheduling is always the excuse. It is better not to conduct a tournament rather than to do so in an unstructured manner. The T20 World Cup should have the 10 top teams playing against each other and similar to the Indian Premier League (IPL) the top-four would qualify wherein the top-two play initially to get into the final and the winner of the bottom-two play the loser of the first match. In the recently concluded T20 WC tournament both England and Pakistan may have benefitted from it. Unfortunately, the two top sides in the league stage of their group lost their semifinal match and did not compete for the trophy. Australia did win the trophy having earlier lost to England. One wonders if that was a fair conclusion. The T20 format is short and quite unpredictable, especially amongst the top-eight sides in the world. On a given day, any of them could beat the other. The grouping of teams never justifies this and so the top-eight or 10 teams need to play against each other to truly reflect a true winner. India beat both England and Australia in their warm-up games. They did not play them in the final draw of the T20 World Cup 2021 because of being put into another group. This is a prime example of the incorrectness of the way in which the tournament was conducted. A World Cup should be played where all the top teams need to get an equal opportunity to display their capabilities against each other. So the ICC should not worry about completing a tournament but should focus on a system that is fair in identifying the winner. The T20 needs teams to be flexible and agile. Teams adjusted to this in the best manner they could in the UAE. The ICC refused to alter their playing conditions, even though everyone was shouting their heads off about the advantage to the team that won the toss because of the dew factor. Aaron Flinch, the Australian captain, summed it up beautifully, when he said that one of the major factors that went into their winning the cup was that he won the toss six out of the seven times . ""The toss was the boss,"" he said. The matches could easily have been made to start an hour earlier so that the toss advantage would have been tossed out of the equation. These are the subtle changes that need to be made by not only the ICC but also the host country administering the tournament. The ODI World Cup in Australia in 1992 was a wonderful example of the format of the top sides playing against each other. Unfortunately, the ridiculous mathematical calculations that came into force for a rain-interrupted match became the black mark of it. However, the structure was perfect in which the top-eight sides played one another. Sourav Ganguly, the President of the BCCI, has now also taken on the responsibility of heading the Cricket Committee of the ICC, a position that he takes over from Anil Kumble. One hopes that as a former cricketer and his immense cricket administrative knowledge that he structures the ICC World Cup tournaments in a way that has more meaningful quality and not quantity to it. One needs to herald and respect a true champion side as worthy winners. That can only happen when one has battled against each of the opponents and come out with flying colours.

I have played the game with pure enjoyment and unbridled enthusiasm. Now, at the age of 37, that flame no longer burns so brightly.""

Chasing 173, Australia reached the target with seven balls to spare. Warner began by taking back-to-back boundaries off Tim Southee in the second over. In the next over, Aaron Finch chipped Trent Boult over long-off for a boundary. But Boult had the last laugh as Finch top-edged a pull to a running deep square leg for a diving catch. Mitchell Marsh welcomed Adam Milne by whacking pace-on deliveries for a six and two fours. But the right-arm pacer conceded just three runs in the final over as Australia reached 43/1 in Power-play. T20 WC highlights Post Power-play, Mitchell Santner and Ish Sodhi kept things tight but Marsh and Warner were quick to thwart the plans of stemming the run-flow. While Marsh slog-swept Santner for a six over deep square leg, Warner slammed Sodhi for two fours and a gigantic six straight down the ground. Marsh welcomed James Neesham in the 11th over with a six over fine leg. It was followed by Warner reaching his half-century in 34 balls with a hoicked six over deep mid-wicket. Boult provided a much-needed breakthrough in the 13th over, ending the 92-run stand by dislodging Warner's stumps. In the next over, Marsh brought up his half-century in 31 balls with a flat slog over long-on off Sodhi, bettering Kane Williamson's record for the fastest fifty in Men's T20 World Cup final. Two balls later, he went on to smash Sodhi for a pull through mid-wicket. Glenn Maxwell took a brace of boundaries against Milne and Southee in 15th and 16th overs as Australia inched closer to the target. Marsh struck two more boundaries before Maxwell finished off the chase with a reverse-sweep past the third man to send Australia into the celebratory mood. Brief scores: New Zealand 172/4 in 20 overs (Kane Williamson 85, Martin Guptill 28, Josh Hazlewood 3-16, Adam Zampa 1-26) lost to Australia 173/2 in 18.5 overs (Mitchell Marsh 77 not out, David Warner 53, Trent Boult 2-6) by eight wickets.

""On Saturday, the teams that will fill those spots were confirmed courtesy of West Indies' loss to Australia, which means they will sit 10th by the cut-off date, with Bangladesh climbing to eighth,"" it added. Going into Saturday's action, the current top six teams on the rankings -- England, Pakistan, India, New Zealand, South Africa, Australia -- had already done enough to ensure they would not slide out of those positions in this tournament.

Although the local bat industry has been there for decades, this is the first time that any international player has used a Kashmir-made willow bat. Story behind Kashmir willow bat Fawzul Kabeer, an MBA graduate from the Islamic University of Science and Technology (IUST) Awantipora, in Anantnag district said the bats used by the Oman cricket team were manufactured at his factory and that he had to do a lot of hard work to realise his dream. These bats are manufactured under the brand label GR8 Sports, the industrial unit located in Halmulla Sangam area of Anantnag. Kabeer, who owns the GR8 Sports firm from his late father, said the manufacturing unit was founded in 1974. ""To begin with, we prepared only the raw material which was then shipped to Jalandhar, Meerut, and other places, where the bats were manufactured and sold under the brand names of the firms who manufactured the fine product. ""This was not a profitable venture, besides the local bar industry remained in oblivion that way. ""We started producing the finished bats at our unit. ""Till then the bat of Kashmir had no recognition, as we were lacking the knowledge about how to take our bat to international level. We had no expertise and technique due to which Kashmir willow bats were being sold unbranded. ""To get our brand recognised, we followed all the rules framed by the International Cricket Council and managed to find some craftsmen whom we recruited into our firm. ""In addition to this, we held discussions with professional craftsmen on how to ensure a unique style of bat making in this industry"", he said. Mohammad Naseem Khushi and Bilal Khan of Oman cricket team have played International fixtures with the bats produced by GR8 Sports. According to Kabeer, Kashmir willow is a 'male variant' of bat wood that has the strength to bear things in a unique way unlike the English willow which is a female variant'. There are more than 300 bat manufacturing units in South Kashmir Anantnag district. The international recognition earned by GR8 Sports is an inspiration for all of them to make World quality cricket bats that can compete with the best in the market. Related","

618,2021-10-26,21:53:32,sports,cricket,What did Waqar Younis Say and Why there is Outrage Over his Comments?," Former Pakistani cricketer Waqar Younis has come under severe criticism for a distasteful and controversial comment made during a chat show in connection with India vs Pakistan T20 match played last Sunday. What did Waqar Younis Say? Waqar Younis, who was one of the panelists on a show aired on ARY News, praised the performance of the Pakistan team, which defeated India at the recently-held match in Dubai. In the course of the show, the former Pakistan captain said, ""The manner in which Babar and Rizwan batted, sensible yet aggressive, the strike-rotation, the look on their faces, it was amazing. The best thing, what Rizwan did, Mashalla, he offered the Namaz on the ground surrounded by Hindus, that was really something very very special for me."" His comments triggered outrage as genuine cricket lovers were unhappy with the comments bringing religion to the sports. The fans, who had condemned a section of netizens for abusing Mohammad Shami over his poor performance, has criticised him for making such a statement. Despite fighting hard on the field, Pakistan and Indian cricketers share a good relationship and have mutual respect. Even Virat Kohli had whole-heartedly congratulated the young boys after losing the match. So, bringing religion to sports has not gone well with the fans. Cricketers Criticise Well-known cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle, expressing his disappointment, tweeted, ""For a person of Waqar Younis' stature to say that watching Rizwan offering namaz in front of Hindus was very special to him, is one of the most disappointing things I have heard. A lot of us try hard to play such things down and talk up sport and to hear this is terrible."" Bhogle further said that Waqar Younis should apologise for his remarks. ""You would think that cricketers, as ambassadors of our game, would be a little more responsible. I am sure there will be an apology on the way from Waqar. We need to unite the cricket world, not divide it by religion. [sic]"" Former cricketer and current PCB chairman Ramiz Raja slammed Younis and tweeted, ""Not surprised at all. I can tell by my own experience, A guy who is racist about his own country's languages and cities can easily say this kinda negative remark about religious differences. #alwaysbitter #alwaysnegative. [sic]"" Likewise, many on Twitter have condemned the former cricketer's comments. Raza Ahmad Rumi: Shameful remarks #waqaryounis -- there is a large Muslim community in India. We have millions of Hindus living in Pakistan. Sport is sport, not a battle of religions. Sreejith Panickar: #MohammadRizwan doing namaz amid 'Hindus' after the win against India was very special for #WaqarYounis! Pakistan never ceases to amaze us with such !diots who mix sports & religion. Remember Ahmed Shehzad who tried to convert Tillakaratne Dilshan? GK: Shocking !! Didn't expect such glaring remarks from a former and established cricketer like #WaqarYounis @waqyounis99 we majority of Hindus provide conducive conditions for our muslim brothers if they perform Namaz & we even switch off speakers during azaan Suvajit Mustafi: Out of all people, it was #waqaryounis. The childhood heroes keep shocking me. Someone offering namaaz in front of us Hindus is a common occurrence here. We also attend Iftars and wish for each other's well-being. Respect for the great cricketer goes here. Anand Dahihandekar: What a shameful person #waqaryounis is ! Beneath the veneer of sophistication an extremist lurks! ordinary Pakistanis here in London were asking us to join in their dance in celebration - all in food humour! Krishna Kant Sharma: Fed on fanaticism & religious bigotry, Pakistani society has become intolerant & hate filled for other faiths & religions What #WaqarYounis did isn't surprising at all Pakistani sportsmen have often described playing against India as jihad The two nation theory is alive & ticking","

India's Humiliating Defeat Pakistan defeated India by 10 wickets on the T20 World Cup despite being underdogs. India's performance came under severe criticism for the team's lack of fighting spirit. Having batted first, India put 151 runs on board after much struggle. On its turn, Pakistan chased the target with ease and without losing a single wicket. Mohammad Rizwan and Babar Azam's brilliant performance helped the Men in Green to cross the winning line with 13 balls to spare. Shami was the expensive among the bowlers and netizens targeted him for India's loss against its arch-rivals. Many singled him out and mercilessly abused him over his poor performance. Some even crossed all the limits by asking him to leave the country and settle in Pakistan. This abuse has been condemned by politicians, critics, and celebrities. From Rahul Gandhi to Harbhajan Singh, many have extended support to the cricketer. Check out their tweets supporting Shami below: Sachin Tendulkar: When we support #TeamIndia, we support every person who represents Team India. @MdShami11 is a committed, world-class bowler. He had an off day like any other sportsperson can have. I stand behind Shami & Team India. Venkatesh Prasad: 355 International wickets. It is India that beats in the heart of anyone representing India. And Mohammad Shami has been an outstanding and yet unsung servant of Indian cricket. More power to him. Irfan Pathan: Even I was part of #IndvsPak battles on the field where we have lost but never been told to go to Pakistan! I'm talking about of few years back. THIS CRAP NEEDS TO STOP. #Shami Harbhajan Turbanator: We love you @MdShami11 #Shami Rahul Gandhi: Mohammad #Shami we are all with you. These people are filled with hate because nobody gives them any love. Forgive them. ದೊಡ್ಡ ಗಣೇಶ್ | Dodda Ganesh: Mohd Shami is a champion bowler. Any player can have an off day. People who're targeting him can't be cricket fans. Let's end this toxicity. In solidarity with #Shami #T20WorldCup Sanjay Jha: The real losers are the dirty morons who are abusing our cricketers. This is the true character of the right-wing and their hate-mongers. #Shami Chinmayi Sripaada: Take the knee for #Shami Yuzvendra Chahal: We are so proud of you @MdShami11 bhaiya Flag of India Kirti Azad: I fully endorse your views @IrfanPathan It is shameful that our great Indian cricketer #Shami is trolled. The team consists of 11 players on the field and 5 on the benches. #INDvPAK #Kohli Virender Sehwag: The online attack on Mohammad Shami is shocking and we stand by him.

On one hand, while brands are trying to cash in on the Indian festival of lights, on the other, social media influencers are not shying away from sharing their two bits or more on how to go about celebrating the ancient festival.  On Sunday, October 17, ex-Indian Cricket Captain Virat Kohli took to his Twitter to share with his fans his new Pinterest campaign on how to celebrate Diwali more meaningfully. The video featuring the man himself stated, ""It's been a tough year for all of us all around the world, especially in India with wave 2 hitting us in 2021. As we get ready for Diwali in this festive season, I will be sharing some of my tips for you to celebrate with loved ones and family."" The teaser video received a rather mixed response with the cricketer's interest in promoting Pinterest and sharing tips on Diwali getting much trolled as fans felt he should stick to his core field of cricket.  Murli Menon, a Twitter user wrote, ""Request you not to teach us how to celebrate a meaningful Diwali with loved ones and family"". We've all been doing it for years - rather decades - so your experience on that count, would be a lot less than ours. Hence, spare us any advice or moralizing please."" Some users even made personal attacks asking about his stance on Anushka's 'no cracker' policy during Diwali when clearly, crackers are okay during birthday and IPL celebrations. Since then, the link to Virat Kohli's Pinterest account has gone missing from his Twitter and Instagram profiles. A screenshot taken of his account by OpIndia prior to the virtual uproar shows his Pinterest page link right under his name and tagline.  Virat Kohli's Pinterest page that boasts 6.11k followers currently shows two videos related to Diwali. While one is the introductory one, in the other, he shares images of his favorite sweets, ragi halwa and besan laddoo during Diwali. There has been no activity on the page since his idea was trolled on Sunday.","

621,2021-10-08,19:08:50,sports,cricket,Indian money keeps PCB afloat; Ramiz Raja drops major truth bombs [read now]," Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ramiz Raja gave the Pakistan Senate Standing Committee a reality check on Thursday about India's influence in the world of cricket associations. Raja pointed out that half of PCB's funding is from the ICC, which in fact raises 90 percent of its money from Indian markets. This means the PCB is, in a way, kept afloat with the help of Indian businesses. ""The PCB gets 50 percent of its funding from the ICC. The ICC conducts tournaments and the income generated from them is distributed among its member boards,"" Raja told the panel. ""Now, 90 percent of the ICC funding is generated from the Indian market. In other words, Indian business houses are running Pakistan cricket."" Raja further added that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has the power to trigger a collapse of PCB. ""If tomorrow, the Indian Prime Minister decides that they will not fund Pakistan cricket, there's a possibility that the PCB can collapse,"" PCB chairman was quoted as saying. New Zealand rescheduling Pakistan tour Raja also told the committee that the New Zealand Cricket (NZC) was ""now rescheduling the tour"" to Pakistan. Raja also added, while briefing the Senate Standing Committee on Inter-Provincial Coordination on Thursday, that the NZC was rescheduling the tour after being pressured by Pakistan. The New Zealand cricket team arrived here on September 11 to play three ODIs and five Twenty20 Internationals. The Black Caps, however, opted out of their tour minutes before the first ODI was to be played on September 17 citing security threats. ""Australia will not stand up to them (India). No country will stand up to them. You saw what happened – they (New Zealand) packed up and left in two minutes. That's because they don't have their own interest in playing in Pakistan, as our cricketing economy is not that strong,"" Raja told the Senate Standing Committee.","

622,2021-09-20,23:50:34,sports,cricket,BCCI doubles remuneration of domestic cricketers; how they compare against Test match earnings [explained]," In June of this year, the Board of Control for Cricket in India decided to form a committee that would look into the compensation package for domestic cricketers. In 2020, for the first time in a long history, BCCI cancelled the Ranji Trophy. A decision that affected nearly 700 cricketers financially, making the Board decide during its AGM to compensate the domestic cricketers. On Monday, the BCCI, after its Apex Council meeting, announced that it will pay 50 percent additional match fee to the domestic cricketers affected by curtailed 20-21 season due to Covid-19. The decision has been long-awaited by domestic cricketers. The Board also hiked the remuneration for the upcoming season. The logistics of remuneration  Before the hike, an active domestic cricketer on average would earn around Rs 20 lakh per annum. Now, per day remuneration for top Ranji cricketers, who have played more than 40 matches, has been almost doubled to Rs 60,000. A decision that will ensure that the players now earn Rs 2.40 lakh for the first-class matches. Before this, a player in a Ranji Trophy game under a similar category was given Rs 35,000 per day.  Moving on, the players who have played 21 to 40 matches will get paid Rs 50,000, while players who have played less than 21 matches will be entitled to a remuneration of Rs 40,000 per day. Collectively, the decision will financially impact more than 2000 male cricketers from the under-16 category to the senior level. For the women cricketers  The BCCI, alongside, also announced a remuneration hike for women cricketers and senior women players. They will now be paid Rs 20,000 per match instead of the earlier Rs 12,500. The decision to increase the compensation was taken by a working committee comprising former India captain Mohammed Azharuddin, Yudhvir Singh, Jaydev Shah, Santosh Menon, Avishek Dalmiya, Rohan Jaitley and Devajit Saikia. Indian players, among the highest paid in the world  With the BCCI among the wealthiest cricketing board, the salary of Indian cricketers playing internationally has always been subject to a great deal of spotlight. Financial contract for the period of 2020-2021 The contract for the current period covers a hefty price paid to cricketers. There are four grades into which the players are divided. The first being Grade A+ contract, wherein a player earns Rs 7 crore per year, while the players falling into the Grade A category earn Rs 5 crore per year. Those in Grade B withdraw Rs 3 crore annually and while the players in Grade C draw Rs 1 crore. It must be noted that this is the fixed amount that a player gets as per the contract and it is delinked to the number of matches a player plays. Indian players get a fixed match fee of Rs 15 lakh for Test Match, while this amount is Rs 6 lakh for One Day International matches and Rs 3 lakh for T20 matches. Out of this money, those who do not play in the XI, draw 50 percent of the match fee. Hit a century? There's a reward The highs of the sixers or four runs don't stay restricted to the pitch or fans but financially get passed onto the performing players. As former Indian opener Aakash Chopra has revealed in his Youtube Vlog, about the bonus money. Chopra revealed to cricket fans and his subscribers that a player gets an extra Rs 7 lakh on scoring a double century. If the batsman scores a century, he takes back home an extra Rs 5 lakh. The bowler who picks a five four earns Rs 5 lakh extra. All of the bonus money is above and beyond their contractual remuneration.","

The couple has not confirmed it, but there are strong indications of their divorce. The recent posts of Ayesha Mukerji have triggered the rumours of them parting ways. Her last two posts on Instagram were all about divorce. Thus giving a strong indication of the couple ending their eight-year marriage. In a post that Ayesha posted a day ago, she has written in length about her experience of being two-time divorce which clearly reveals that their marriage has ended. The message read:    , ??? So many women that I work with either fear the loss of friendships or are experiencing loss of relationships while going through a divorce or after a divorce. ⠀ Have you? ⠀ If you have, I just want you to know that it's NORMAL..... Do not think or feel you are alone going through this or there is something wrong with you. ⠀ There is absolutely nothing wrong with you and sometimes things and people fall away from your life because they no longer align with who you are. ⠀ 1️⃣Many relationships break down because they were based on you being a couple ⠀ 2️⃣Many friendships breakdown because they feel awkward and uncomfortable with the circumstances and think they have to pick sides ⠀ 3️⃣Many relationships die off because they were not that solid to begin with ⠀ 4️⃣Many friendships break because there might be a judgment on the concept of divorce itself ⠀ 5️⃣Many relationships end because you both have outgrown each other genuinely ⠀ There are many reasons for relationships changing and breaking down. It's best to not judge the people rather accept it's a normal part of change and growth. ⠀ Once you get this, then you allow for.... ⠀ ♥️New relationships to enter into your life ⠀ ♥️New friendships to blossom ⠀ ♥️Older relationships to be even deeper ⠀ ♥️New communities and tribes to show up ⠀ ♥️A deeper relationship with yourself ⠀ If you are wanting to get in touch with yourself, re establish a relationship with yourself and be a part of a new tribe and community with step by step guidance from me then dm me 'family' and book a Vision Call ☎️ to see if you are a fit to work 1:1 with me. In the latest post too, Ayesha Mukerji has spoken about handling life after divorce. THOUGHT DIVORCE WAS A DIRTY WORD UNTIL I BECAME A 2 TIME DIVORCEE. ⠀ Funny how words can have such powerful meanings and associations. I experienced this first hand as a divorcee. The first time I went through a divorce I was soooooooo fu@kn scared. I felt like I had failed and I was doing something so wrong at that time. ⠀ I felt as if I had let everyone down and even felt selfish. I felt that I was letting my parents down, I felt that I was letting my children down and even to some extent I felt as if I was letting God down. Divorce was such a dirty word. ⠀ So now imagine, I have to go through it a second time. Woooahhhhhh. That is terrifying. Being divorced once before already, felt like I had more at stake the second time round. I had more to prove. So when my second marriage broke down it was really scary. All the feelings I felt when I went through it the first time came flooding in. Fear, failure and disappointment x 100. What does this mean for me? How does this define me and my relationship to marriage? ⠀ Well, once I went through the necessary actions and emotions of what had happened I was able to sit with myself and see that I was fine, I was actually doing great, even noticed my fear had totally disappeared. The remarkable thing is I actually felt much more empowered. I realised my fear and the meaning I gave to the word divorce was my own doing. ⠀ So, once I realised this I started to redefine the word and the experience of divorce according to the way I wanted to see it and experience it. ⠀ ❤️Divorce means choosing myself and not settling and sacrificing my own life for the sake of a marriage ⠀ ❤️Divorce means even though you do your best and try your best things sometimes do not work out and that's ok ⠀ ❤️Divorce means I have had amazing relationships that have taught me great lessons to carry forward in new relationships ⠀ ❤️Divorce means I am stronger and more resilient than I ever thought ⠀ ❤️Divorce really means whatever meaning you give to it. ⠀ If you're struggling with divorce or scared to end a relationship based on being labelled a divorcee then dm 'divorce' and book in a Vision Call with me to work 1:1 Aesha Mukerji, a Bengali, is a trained kick-boxer settled in Australia.

624,2021-09-06,15:48:26,sports,cricket,"Marketing lessons from netizens: Cricket ads superimposed on pitch irritate potential buyers, not drive sales up"," What are the chances a hard-core cricket fan is going to buy the toothpaste that they just tried selling in the middle of the pitch? Even before a run is completed? There is a difference between grabbing eyeballs and pushing a product down consumers' throat (in this case, eyes). And then there's hampering a cricket fan's viewing experience and irritating the potential customers. Which is exactly what has been happening, especially during the India Tour of England 2021 test matches aired on SonyLiv. Twitter user H R Venkatesh echoed the sentiments of millions of viewers in the post, ""Advertising even before a run is completed? Every. Single. Time."" Tagging the broadcast channel Sony Liv, he further questioned, ""Shouldn't viewers have rights? These brands happy contributing to the irritation of the viewer?"" Furthermore, the advertisements in question are inserted using AR Tech. The brands are not actually there on the ground, but only virtually on the pitch. And it goes without saying that it hurts all the more when the viewer is paying a hefty price for the subscription as well. Given India's love for cricket and the massive reach the sport has, advertising on cricket grounds has been a proven way to reach the potential customers and increase the sales. But of late, the platform has come in for misuse rather than optimum use. Who hasn't felt frustrated at the suddenly shrunk size of the screen to send out a commercial message, the moment the game gets exciting? Why are the commercials so loud and jingles so noisy that one needs to reach for the mute button on remote, during any ad break? What another ad break? Didn't you just see one? Acknowledging the crossed line by advertising and corporates, Telecom Regularity Authority of India (TRAI) in 2012 proposed a few regulations in a paper titled, ""Issues Related to Advertisements on TV Channels."" Among the seven proposed stipulations, a few concerned sporting events as well. ""In case of sporting events being telecast live, the advertisements shall only be carried during the interruptions in the sporting action e.g, half time in football or hockey match, lunch/drinks break in cricket matches, game/set change in case of tennis etc."" TRAI also said that there shall be only full screen advertisements. Part screen advertisements will not be permitted. Drop down advertisements will also not be permitted. Addressing the audio issues with the ads, it also said, ""The audio level of the advertisements shall not be higher than the audio level of the programme."" In 2017, once again the broadcasting watchdog laid down a few rules just during the final lap of marketing haven IPL. It once again came heavily on drop down advertisements, the duration of ads and when they could be aired. Unlike in the 90s when cola companies bombarded the greens with pre-painted ads, now there are no pre-painted ads on the cricket grass and instead, the ad logos are projected onto the field by using it as a green screen. The novelty at severely hampering viewers' experience doesn't stay restricted to just the pitch. What started as a mild form of marketing with brand logos on the players' uniforms, has extended to every imaginable object in the stadium. ""This is so disturbing to the eyes, it sometimes remains superimposed on the bowler! And the app is so despicable for consumers too,"" wrote a user. Where are the insightful marketing studies? So, not in sync with customer sentiment? Wrote another, ""I think I am one of those who never used these brands and won't even use in future."" There is no denying the risk of driving clients to the other side of the fence.","

The availability of foreign players being one major hurdle. When asked about the same, the official said they had their fingers crossed and were hopeful of positive outcomes. It's only if a couple of significant names can't turn that the future course of action will be decided accordingly.  Picking up replacements for major foreign players would be difficult, but the official said that BCCI is in touch with foreign boards. The BCCI though hasn't yet officially announced anything on its official Twitter handle. On May 4, IPL 2021 was postponed indefinitely and with immediate effect given the country's unprecedented rise in Covid cases. At the time, BCCI and IPL governing council itself came under immense criticism for holding the matches in the first place. The suspension was also in the offing after Covid-19 breached two franchise bio-bubbles. SRH's Wriddhiman Saha tested positive and after the news became public, it became necessary to quarantine the entire Sunrisers Hyderabad.

627,2021-05-18,00:02:58,sports,cricket,Heartbreaking story of an umpire; how it became reason for K Vaitheeswaran to give up on his passion," Hailed as the 'Father of E-commerce' in India, K Vaitheeswaran recently shared an unpleasant experience from the times he was also working as an umpire. The man behind the book - Failing to Succeed – has revealed how difficult and challenging a job being an umpire can be. Vaitheeswaran took to social media to share an old but real story from almost four decades ago. The incident goes back to his time as a registered umpire for Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA). Vaitheeswaran revealed that he used to play corporate cricket but couldn't continue it once he shifted to Bangalore for a career move. However, for him, watching the match replays on his television was not enough. So, he decided to sit for the written and verbal tests by KSCA to be an umpire. And it shouldn't be a surprise that he did clear those. From lower-level league, inter-city to internationals, he was a registered umpire. He recalled the times he was even abused during a match by the players over an LBW. Then, one time, on a Sunday, he and one other umpire were called to inspect the ground and declare whether it was playable. On reaching the ground, he met Shrinivas, his co-umpire. Shrinivas had already taken a look at the muddy stadium and forwarded the duly filled form to Vaitheeswaran to sign. Shrinivas even urged him to sign it fast. The other side to the story Vaitheeswaran asked him the reason behind the urgency and another person (marker) told him the story. ""Shrinivas was the sole bread winner in his family with aged parents and younger siblings. He did several odd jobs and cricket umpiring was one such job for him. While he was keen on the game, the meagre amount paid to umpires per game by KSCA was an added income stream. I now turned to Shrinivas who was looking very embarrassed. He explained to me that he had to rush the signed form to KSCA office and request a cheque which he could clear from the bank before closing hours. They had some urgent family expenses."" And he quit Vaitheeswaran added that he never felt the need to withdraw whatever little he was making for being an umpire. He went home and told his wife the story. He said that his wife asked him to stop umpiring as it was preventing someone who could really use the money from doing so. With the intelligence typical of wives, she told me to stop umpiring because every time I drove to the ground in a car to umpire a game because of some passion, I was stopping another Shrinivas from earning really useful money. ""Some careers are not meant to take off and you feel disappointed. Not this one though. I never met Shrinivas again. Not sure why but today I just thought of him. I hope he and his folks are doing well. God Bless,"" he concluded.","

628,2021-04-12,00:21:48,sports,cricket,KKR vs SRH IPL 2021 highlights : Kolkata Knight Riders win against Sunrisers Hyderabad by 10 runs," KKR has won its first match of the season against SRH. Kolkata Knight Riders delivered a spectacular performance in their season opener match against Sunrisers Hyderabad. KKR won by 10 runs. Riding on the strong batting supported by good bowling in the power play and towards the end, KKR gave a sneak peek into their much balanced side in comparison to the last season. What makes this win even more special is that this was KKR's 100th win in IPL across all the seasons. Highlights After the early dismissal of Shubman Gill; Nitish Rana and Rahul Tripathi displayed some attacking cricket and laid the foundation for a 200 plus score. Owing to this partnership, despite late stutter and wickets falling in heap in the last few overs, KKR ended up with a formidable 187 on the board. The Chennai wicket appeared to be two paced since the beginning of the inning but the dew factor was expected to negate this effect in the second inning. Scoreboard In the second inning, KKR started strongly by keeping the runs under check and also accounting for two early wickets including that of David Warner. David Warner was given a respite in the first over itself when Harbhajan Singh, playing his first match in KKR colours, induced a false drive which ended up in Warner playing it in the air towards Pat Cummins. Cummins, running in from the point area, failed to hold onto the chance. But, this did not cost KKR much as Prasidh Krishna bowled a snorter which made edge to the safe hands of Dinesh Karthik. After the power play, Bairstow and Manish Pandey stitched a good partnership and kept SRH in the contention for victory. Later in the inning, after Bairstow's dismissal off Pat Cummins, the pace of the innings slowed down. The run rate mounted beyond 12 per over. Manish Pandey held one end intact scoring runs at a good pace but kept on losing his partners at the other end. Good last overs from the KKR pacers closed the deal.","

629,2021-04-10,13:58:06,sports,cricket,RCB beat MI IPL 2021: How did the trends fare at IPL opener [Detailed]," Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) beat Mumbai Indians (MI) by two wickets in the opening match of IPL 2021. Played at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, the match remained a complete thriller till the last ball. Let's take a look at the trends and the predictions and how did it fare. Mumbai Indians loses first IPL match again Continuing their tradition of losing the first match of every IPL since 2013, Mumbai Indians' didn't surprise us this time either. Despite a thrilling finish at the end, RCB came on the top and defeated Mumbai by 2 wickets. Ever since 2013, Mumbai Indians' have been losing their first league match of every IPL. The Chidambaram factor MA Chidambaran has off-late been a happy hunting ground for Mumbai. The MI won their last five matches being played on this ground. And the other hand, the ground had always been a difficult venue for Royal Challengers Bangalore. RCB had set a record of losing back-to-back all the last five matches they played on this ground. Glenn Maxwell Glenn Maxwell has always been an enigma with the bundle-of-talent that he is. However, the Australian cricketer doesn't always translate his cricketing prowess into his performance on the field. Despite playing his first IPL for Delhi in 2012, and since then playing for Mumbai, Punjab and Delhi; the only IPL season where he managed to set the stage on fire was in 2014. In 2014, Maxwell's all-round performance for Punjab took KXIP to the finals which happen to be their only appearance in IPL finals. For the last few seasons, Glenn Maxwell's batting performance deteriorated severely. So much so that Virender Sehwag went on to call him a ""ten crore cheerleader"". However, despite the criticisms coming his way, Maxwell was bought at an astronomical amount of Rs 14.25 crores by RCB. And by teaming up with RCB, he went on to break his own dry spell of not hitting a six for 1079 days in yesterday's match. His humongous 100-m six surprised even the likes of Virat Kohli.","

630,2021-04-10,01:05:03,sports,cricket,RCB vs MI IPL 2021 highlights: Royal Challengers Bangalore pull off last ball thriller against Mumbai Indians," Seamer Harshal Patel's five-wicket haul (5/27) helped Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) beat Mumbai Indians (MI) by two wickets in a last ball thriller in the opening match of the 2021 Indian Premier League (IPL) season at the MA Chidambaram Stadium here on Friday. Patel ran through MI's middle and lower order to restrict them to 159/9 after they were cruising at 86/1 midway through their innings. RCB were then powered by a 27-ball 48 from AB de Villiers and a 28-ball 39 from Glenn Maxwell even as they made heavy weather of the chase, winning it off the last ball of the match even though they had been set up well by a 52-run third-wicket stand between skipper Virat Kohli (33 off 29) and Maxwell. Earlier, after MI looked set for a big total halfway through their innings, RCB pulled back by getting rid of Suryakumar Yadav (31 off 23) and Chris Lynn (49 off 35) in quick succession. Patel, the right-arm pacer who plays for Haryana in domestic cricket, then ran through the middle-order. He got rid of dangerous hitters Ishan Kishan, Hardik Pandya, Kieron Pollard and Krunal Pandya, besides dismissing tail-ender Marco Jansen to put the brakes on a strong MI batting line-up. RCB vs MI MI batsman Yadav looked set for a big score, but RCB's new recruit Kyle Jamieson forced an edge off his bat that was neatly collected by de Villiers behind the stumps. Washington Sundar then caught Lynn off his own bowling, as he looked to go for a big hit but instead lobbed it high in the air, as MI slid to 105/3 in 12.5 overs. There were still 43 balls left and MI had their power-hitters in the dugout. However, Patel got into the act and ran through the middle and lower order. He deceived Hardik Pandya with a slow full toss, got Ishan Kishan with a yorker, had Krunal Pandya caught at deep mid-wicket and then also had Kieron Pollard caught in the deep. He then bowled IPL debutant South African Marco Jansen to complete a fifer. RCB got off to a flier -- scoring 36 runs in just four overs -- before two quick wickets of opener Washington Sundar and newcomer Rajat Patidar pegged them back. Kohli and Maxwell then took their team to safety but four wickets for 24 runs in the space of four overs saw them struggling at 122/6 in the 17th over. De Villiers then went after the bowling to take them close before he was run out. MI sensed a chance but with just two needed off two balls, they had left it too late. Brief scores: Mumbai Indians 159/9 in 20 overs (C Lynn 49, S Yadav 31, I Kishan 28, H Patel 5/27) vs Royal Challengers Bangalore 160/8 in 20 overs (AB de Villiers 48, G Maxwell 39, V Kohli 33, J Bumrah 2/26, M Jansen 2/28).

On March 27, back in 1994, opener Navjot Singh Sidhu suffered a stiff neck and wasn't available to open in the second ODI against New Zealand in Auckland. The team management reluctantly let Tendulkar open. The right-handed batsman had volunteered to open the Indian innings to which the team think-tank initially objected as they didn't want to lose their best batsman to new ball. However, he opened and made a 49-ball 82 to help India chase down a 143-run target in 23.2 overs and win the match by seven wickets. Sachin Tendulkar, the opener That knock cemented his place at the top of the order. He made 45 of his 49 centuries batting as an opener. Prior to him opening the batting, he had batted in positions from No. 3 to No. 7, scoring 1758 runs in 69 matches at an average of 30.84 with 13 half-centuries. Most of his fifties in that pre-opening period came at No. 4. Since this day 27 years ago, when he opened an ODI innings for the first time, Tendulkar scored 15,310 runs in 340 innings as opener, averaging 48.29. Overall, since 27 March, 1994, he made 16,668 runs in 386 innings at an average of 47.08. He batted 35 times at No. 4 (scoring four centuries), nine times at No. 3 and once each at Nos. 5 and 6.

During the second Test of the two-match series against Pakistan, Kumble picked up all the wickets at the Feroz Shah Kotla, now known as the Arun Jaitley Cricket Stadium. India had lost the first Test in Chennai by a slim margin of 12 runs and were in a must-win situation in the Delhi Test.

In the second innings, Sadgopan Ramesh (96) and Sourav Ganguly (62*) scored gritty half centuries as India posted a 420-run target for the visitors. The visitors got off to a steady start in their chase as openers Shahid Afridi and Saeed Anwar put on 101 runs for the first wicket. The match seemed to be in balance until Kumble was introduced into the attack and wreaked havoc on the Pakistani batting line-up. He first dismissed Afridi (41) in the 25th over. After that, India didn't let go off the foot of the paddle through Kumble and Pakistan were reduced to 128/6 in no time.

However, the Indian team on Tuesday went one step further as they came out with one of the best Day Five batting performances to beat Australia by three wickets in the fourth and final Test at The Gabba, thereby winning the four-match Border-Gavaskar series 2-1. Chasing a mammoth target of 328 on the final day of the match, that too at a venue where Australia had not tasted defeat in last 32 years, India rode on brilliant half centuries of Shubman Gill, Rishabh Pant and Cheteshwar Pujara to register one of India's most historic win in Test cricket. When India scored winning runs, Pant remained unbeaten on 89 Resuming the day at 4/0, Australia entered favourites and gave India an early blow as Rohit Sharma got out after scoring just seven. Sharma edged one behind to Tim Paine off the bowling of Pat Cummins at team's score of 18. However, Gill and Pujara then shared a brilliant 114-run partnership during the course of which both collected runs at a brisk pace. While Gill was the more aggressive batsman of the duo, Pujara batted in his usual self, coping numerous blows on his helmet and hands but not giving up. Gill, who scored his second half century, looked all set to register his maiden, well-deserved Test hundred before he got out for 91 against Nathan Lyon -- who was playing his 100th Test. Skipper Ajinkya Rahane, who came in next, looked positive right from the word go and shared a quick 35-run stand with Pujara. Rahane, after contributing with 24 off just 22 balls to India's total, however got out caught behind against Pat Cummins. India then sent in Pant, instead of Mayank Agarwal, clearly signalling their intentions of going for the win. Pujara and Pant stitched a 61-run partnership before India's batting mainstay got out after playing a gritty, magnificent knock of 56 runs, which came off 211 balls. Agarwal (9 off 15) then added 37 runs and once again put India in the ascendency. However, the right-handed batsman got out at team's score of 265, with India still needing 63 runs to win. Washington Sundar scored valuable 62 runs in the first innings, then came out all guns blazing Washington Sundar, who had scored valuable 62 runs in the first innings, then came out all guns blazing and scored quick-fire 22 runs before getting bowled by Lyon, with India still needing 10. Shardul Thakur, India's unlikely batting hero in the first innings having scored 67 runs, then got out after scoring just two. However, the work was almost done by then and Pant fittingly scored the winning boundary as India became the first team to beat Australia at The Gabba in over 32 years. India had scored 336 in their first innings in reply to Australia's 369. The visitors then bowled out Australia for 294 in their second innings, thus setting themselves a target of 328. The hosts had won the first Test of the series in Adelaide, while bowling out India with the pink ball for their lowest Test total of 36. The Rahane-led side, however, registered a stunning comeback in Melbourne, winning the Boxing Day Test by eight wickets. The third Test then ended in an epic draw in Sydney. India, under Virat Kohli, in 2018-19 tour of Australia, had become the first Asian team to win a Test series Down Under. Brief scores: India 336 and 329/7 (Shubman Gill 91, Rishabh Pant 89*; Cheteshwar Pujara 56; Pat Cummins 4/55) beat Australia 369 and 294 by three wickets.","

Her sister Geeta Phogat too had similar honours for the country, parts of which were depicted in the blockbuster Dangal, which was loosely based on their lives.  Wishes have been pouring in from all corner of the world  Well, hold on. IND vs AUS, 3rd Test:  the match ends in a draw January 11 will forever be engraved in our mind. Today India managed to draw the third Test match against Australia, with a resilient performance on Day 5, at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG). India scored 334 runs for five wickets on Day 5 to defy the Australians. Trailing by 309 runs at the beginning of Day 5, the visitors lost Ajinkya Rahane early on to a Nathan Lyon delivery. The stand-in captain could only muster four runs. But Cheteshwar Pujara and Rishabh Pant had other plans, counterattacking the Aussie bowlers. Pujara registered 77 runs off 205 balls, hitting 12 fours. Meanwhile, Pant slammed 97 from 118 deliveries, which consisted of 12 fours and three sixes. The duo's contribution helped India stage a turnaround, and at one point looked set for an improbable win. But Pujara and Pant fell as India's hopes faded again. Hanuma Vihari and Ravichandran Ashwin batted for more than three hours, despite the former suffering a hamstring injury. Vihari remained unbeaten after scoring 23 runs off 161 balls while veteran spinner Ashwin showed his experience with an unbeaten 39-run knock of 128 balls to take India to a memorable draw. Josh Hazlewood put in a noteworthy display for Australia, registering two dismissals. Meanwhile, Lyon also scalped two wickets. For the unversed, the four-match Test series is currently level at 1-1, with the final match set to begin from January 15 Virat on paternity leave In December 2020, Captain Kohli had chosen to take paternity leave and fly back to India from Australia where Team India was playing.

We were finally allowed to leave at 6 AM. Therefore, the speculation by parts of the media that there were arrests made are completely incorrect and also irresponsible. I fail to understand why we were made to wait or what the issue was with the authorities and the club. I am setting the record straight with this statement. I have utmost regard and respect for the Mumbai Police and for all their selfless efforts in keeping us Mumbaikars safe. Without their constant vigilance for public welfare, we would not feel safe.

Besides still holding the Orange Cap, has also made a distinction for covering the maximum distance between the wickets among all the batsmen this IPL season. The KXIP captain has scored 300 of his 670 runs in singles, two's or three's. He has also run from the non-striker's end to add another 278 runs to his team's score. That puts his overall tally of the 22-yard forays this year across three grounds in the UAE at 578 runs produced. The distance that Rahul covered in doing so comes to an estimated 12,716 metres, or 11.62 kilometres, according to the GloFans Cric Data Metrics. Additionally, 28-year-old Rahul hit 58 fours and 23 sixes in his 14 innings. Virat Kohli comes next in running between the wickets during the tournament. Of the 460 runs that Kohli scored, 302 came from running between the wickets which is the highest in terms of percentage of runs and two more than what Rahul achieved. However, Rahul enjoys a clear edge from the non-striker's end. Kohli had run 217 runs from the bowler's end, 61 runs less than Rahul's tally which would place Kohli's overall effort for the tournament behind that of the KXIP skipper. (With inputs from IANS)","

659,2020-10-20,19:54:52,sports,cricket,'Pending SC issues' keep Indians out of ICC chairperson's post," No Indian has apparently filed a nomination for the post of International Cricket Council (ICC) chairperson due to 'matters pending with Supreme Court', it has been learnt, although there has been no confirmation about the list of nominees from the ICC. There have been unconfirmed reports that Singapore's Imran Khwaja and New Zealand's Greg Barclay were the only two nominees when the last date of filing nominations closed on Sunday. BCCI president Sourav Ganguly was considered a key contender for the post which was vacated by Shashank Manohar earlier this year, who quit following two terms. However, it has been learnt that Ganguly did not file nomination due to issues pending in the Supreme Court. ""There are many issues pending with Supreme Court. Like this new constitution (of the BCCI), which puts restrictions. The Board had to keep that in mind which is why no Indian, including Ganguly, features in the list of nominees,"" said a source close to the development. Also, the Annual General Meeting (AGM) that alone decides important matters dealing with the world governing body, had to be held by September 30 but has been postponed due to Covid-19. There is no provision in the constitution that gives the governing body or Apex Council the right to delegate decision-making powers on matters such as these to office-bearers. Technically, nothing stops Ganguly from becoming ICC chairperson unlike in the case of Srinivasan, who is already over 70 and disqualified due to age. But if Ganguly were to go to ICC, then he'd have to vacate his BCCI post just like Manohar did when he became the ICC chairperson. Anurag Thakur became the Board president back in 2016 after Manohar stepped down to take over ICC as chairperson. Clause 14 (9) in the constitution says, ""Any vacancy in the Apex Council due to death, resignation, insolvency, unsoundness of mind, nomination to the ICC or other disqualifications shall be filled up for the remaining period..."" The Board administration is of the opinion that as it is, it was tough to get five-seven people for the posts last time around -- last year when new dispensation took charge -- because most seasoned administrators had to be excluded due to various clauses in the constitution related to tenure and cooling-off period. ""When you have limited people then if you send someone there (to ICC), it is an issue. Because of the clauses in the new constitution, even N Srinivasan couldn't be considered as nominee,"" added the source. A few months back, the board had filed an application with the Supreme Court to seek extension of the tenures of Ganguly and BCCI secretary Jay Shah, both of whom had completed their tenures and had to undergo cooling-off period. The SC didn't hear it, leaving the matter pending. The two have continued to be in charge since. The ICC constitution is silent even on simple matters of election, let alone the intricacies - it is unclear if 2/3rd majority or simple majority will be used to elect the chairperson. The elections have been a confidential process. When contacted by IANS, the ICC responded without divulging anything. ""The process as agreed by the ICC Board, is underway and being overseen by the independent chairman of the Audit Committee. Information on the outcome of the process will be shared at its conclusion,"" the response said. (With inputs from IANS)","

It's a personal way of showing love and a specific indulgence shared between partners that strengthens their bond. When it comes to Bollywood film heritage, romance is an inextricable component. Some directors are brave enough to depict various shades of passion in their films, and they don't hold back in presenting the physical act of love in all its grandeur. Kissing sequences have frequently been used in Bollywood films to illustrate stories about love and desire. We still have a long track to go until we have our own 'Fifty Shades of Gray,' but in the meantime, relish this list of romantic Bollywood kisses. Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone in Ram Leela The love story of Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone is nothing short of a fairy tale. Their romance blossomed in the sets of Goliyon Ram Leela. Their magnetic chemistry was so strong that simply viewing them on film made their fans wimpy in the knees. The euphoric kiss during the song Ang Laga De is intensely passionate. Kamal Haasan and Rani Mukerji in Hey Ram What happens if two odd couples Rani Mukherjee and Kamal Haasan unite together for a movie? We get a glimpse of the most romantic intimate kissing scene!

In the film, indeed there was a passionate, almost forbidden love affair, and the kiss occurs at a particularly romantic point in their relationship. Emraan Hashmi and Mallika Sherawat in Murder Murder is the film that nurtured a generation's sexual awakening. It was a replica of the Hollywood blockbuster Unfaithful and is loaded with hot sex scenes. Mallika Sherawat went to great lengths to nail the part of an adulteress seeking physical and emotional fulfillment outside of her marriage, in the arms of an ex-boyfriend. Both Emraan Hashmi and Mallika rose to fame, with the former earning the moniker of ""serial kisser."" Madhuri Dixit and Vinod Khanna in Dayavan Madhuri Dixit made her film debut with Rajshri Productions' Abodh in 1984, but it was her sizzling passionate kiss with Vinod Khanna in Dayavan (1988) that cemented her place in the Bollywood industry. Despite their age difference, they had unmistakable chemistry that brought the picture to life. ","

665,2022-02-12,11:31:38,entertainment,bollywood,"Not just Gehraiyaan, these five Bollywood movies too handled themes on infidelity"," Gehraiyaan, touted as India's first domestic noir film promises to drive where Bollywood movies frequently don't. The movie starring Deepika Padukone investigates the havoc that broken relationships can wreak. The film was released on Amazon Prime Video on February 11, and without any spoilers, it's clear from the trailer that the plot revolves around infidelity and the price we pay for our rash decisions. The themes of betrayal, lust, and tangled romantic relationships have unquestionably kept us fascinated on Gehraiyaan. This Bollywood film has a distinct texture because the characters' passionate romantic chemistry gets thwarted by a pervasive sense of loss. But this isn't the first time in Bollywood that infidelity has been depicted. If you enjoy viewing films about intricate love relationships, here's a list of movies to see this weekend: Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna The movie is about two couples who are unhappy in their marriages. The film directed by Karan Johar brings together Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Preity Zinta, Abhishek Bachchan, Rani Mukerji, and Kirron Ker. Dev (Shah Rukh Khan) and Maya (Rani Mukerji), who are already married, fall in love and have an extramarital affair in the film. Due to Karan Johar's clumsy handling of this delicate subject, both Dev and Maya were portrayed as villains, in stark contrast to Rishi and Riya, the goodhearted perfect spouses we were rooting for at the end. Love faded from public consciousness, and the only thing that remained was infidelity. Released in 2006, Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna was a subtle look at infidelity and the mirage of blissful marriages. Life In a Metro 'Life In A Metro,' considered one of filmmaker Anurag Basu's best works and one of Hindi cinema's finest flicks, is warmly remembered for complex love relationships. The story revolves around young people who want to make it big fast with values they little respect and want to climb the corporate ring fast. Starring Dharmendra, Nafisa Ali, Shilpa Shetty, Irrfan, Konkona Sen Sharma, Kangana Ranaut among other prominent actors, the movie is about different stories of interconnected lives of a diverse group of people living in the same metro city. Released in 2007, it became successful in the box office. Murder Anurag Basu's Murder was an erotic thriller released in 2004. Successful at the box office, the movie was based on the 2002 American film Unfaithful. The film, which starred Mallika Sherawat, Emraan Hashmi, and Ashmit Patel, was about an extramarital affair and its tragic consequences. Simran (Mallika) is married to Sudhir (Ashmit). She gets into an extramarital life with her ex-boyfriend Sunny (Emraan Hashmi) because of her loneliness and passionless life. With some brazen sex scenes, the movie is worth seeing at least once. Rustom Director Tinu Suresh Desai's uninspiring film starring Akshay Kumar is based on the notorious Nanavati case that occurred in Mumbai in 1959. A Navy commander is distraught when he discovers about his wife's adulterous affair with one of his buddies. He ends up in prison after killing his friend. But, the film takes the risk of portraying a man who has matured to the point where he understands and forgives his errant wife. Ileana D'Cruz and Akshay Kumar were praised for their performances in the film released in 2016. Silsila Starring veteran actors Rekha, Amitabh Bachchan, and Jaya Bachchan, Yash Chopra's romance movie was the first of a kind during that time. The movie revolved around an extramarital affair between a married man Bachchan and his former love Rekha. Even though the film was a box-office failure, it gained cult status later.  The film is said to be based on the alleged real-life love triangle of Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bachchan, and Rekha. Their affairs were one of the most discussed relationships in Bollywood. .","

681,2021-11-23,11:41:57,entertainment,bollywood,Aamir Khan to get married for the third time after divorcing Kiran Rao?," Aamir Khan's third marriage reports have been running wild on social media. Speculations of the actor being ready for marriage for the third time, after divorcing Kiran Rao have surfaced everywhere. What led to the speculations remains unknown, but, there was a strong buzz that Khan would announce his wedding after the release of Laal Singh Chadha. Aamir Khan's link up The wild theories running around even predicted that it is Aamir's Dangal co-star Fatima Sana Shaikh, who would be the woman in the actor's life. However, the reports are absolutely baseless and untrue says a source. Aamir and Fatima have often been linked together, something which the duo has always denied. And the rumors mills churning out these stories are again nothing but fake. Fatima rubbished the rumours Fatima had earlier said that such reports disturb her. ""A bunch of strangers, whom I've never met, are writing things about me. They don't even know if there's any truth to it. People reading it assume that I'm 'not a good person'. You feel like telling that person, 'Ask me, I'll give you an answer. It disturbs me because I don't want people to assume wrong things,"" Fatima had said in an interview. Aamir - Kiran's separation Aamir Khan and Kiran Rao had emotionally separated in 2019, a FPJ report had said. ""The reason why he and Kiran decided to separate is simple — over the years, apparently, both of them outgrew the institution of marriage. There were no differences or issues as such. You continue loving your partner, but as a friend. While your values and beliefs may remain the same, your needs, views on life, wants and opinions change with time — including your perspective on love and marriage,"" the report quoted an insider saying.","

According to the latest updates, Sooryavanshi will be the first biggie that will hit the big screens soon, and if everything goes well, the film will be released on November 05, 2021. Considering the lavish budget associated with the movie, it has been learned that the film will be releasing in all theaters, in Maharashtra, and it will not share the screens with other movies. Sooryavanshi following the path of Marakkar Earlier, the makers of the Mollywood movie Marakkar had requested theater owners in Kerala to provide all screens during the release of the movie. Theater owners agreed to the request, and upon release, this Mohanlal starrer will be screened throughout Kerala.  And now, Sooryavanshi is also following the same path, and theater owners have apparently given a green signal to the request.  However, the decision to release Sooryavanshi exclusively in all theaters has created confusion, as films like Antim and Marvel's Eternals will be also releasing at the same time.  Earlier, it has been reported that Antim starring Salman Khan and Aayush Sharma will be also releasing on November 05.

The latest addition in this list is the official Hindi remake of Mollywood blockbuster Driving License that had Prithviraj Sukumaran and Suraj Venjaramoodu in the lead roles. It has been earlier reported that Akshay Kumar will play the role of Prithviraj in this movie, and now latest reports suggest that Emraan Hashmi has been roped in to play the role of Suraj Venjaramoodu.  Emraan Hashmi to play the role of a motor vehicle inspector In the original version of Driving License, Prithviraj Sukumaran played the role of a superstar. Suraj Venjaramoodu who is a motor vehicle inspector by profession is an ardent fan of the superstar, but at one point in time, he develops a conflict with his on-screen God.  According to reports, the makers of the Hindi remake have reworked the script to suit the tastes of the audiences. It should be also noted that the one-line story of Driving License had little similarities with Shah Rukh Khan's driving license, which also narrated a story of superstar-fan conflict.  Raj Mehta will be directing the Hindi remake of the Driving License, and it will be bankrolled by Karan Johar under the banner of Dharma Productions.  Can Emraan Hashmi portray such a challenging role on screen?  The original version of Driving License, upon its release, had received positive reviews from audiences and critics alike. The major attraction of the movie was the scintillating performances of Prithviraj Sukumaran and Suraj Venjaramoodu. Both of them portrayed characters with little negative shades in this movie.  Audiences are now eagerly waiting to see how Emraan Hashmi will portray the role which Suraj immortalized on the screen, especially considering the fact that the character demands pure natural acting. For Akshay Kumar, portraying the role of Prithviraj Sukumaran could be a cakewalk, as his character is of a Superstar, who leads a flamboyant lifestyle. ","

Director Sandeep Mohan's 'Nirmal Anand Ki Puppy' is an indie art-house film meant to be appreciated leisurely on a quiet Sunday afternoon. Languidly paced, this slice-of-life film gingerly shows us, literarily and figuratively, how it's a dog's life for Nirmal Anand. Life may be a bitch at times, and at the Anand household, with its centre of attention being Paree their dog, you'd expect this film to revolve around their canine, but instead what you witness is a cute, sensitive film about life and relationships. Nirmal Anand leads a busy and mundane life as the regional manager of a pharmaceutical company selling DiaBye, a drug for diabetic patients. But when he is diagnosed with diabetes himself, he starts questioning life till he gets an opportunity to act in a film. How this acting stint threatens the very foundation of his marriage, forms the crux of the narrative. With well-etched characters and competent actors performing their parts convincingly, the plot meanders on a mid-line graph questioning modern-day relationships. While the writing is simple and straightforward, the screenplay gets a bit confusing for a moment when Sarah dreams of her past. Alhough it has no major dramatic inciting moments, the film holds your attention till the last frame. The casting is near perfect and the actors perform their parts with sincerity. Karanveer Khullar is endearing as the forever-despondent Nirmal Anand. He sensitively handles the complex nuances of his character with elan and his pain, on-screen, is palpable. Gillian Pinto as Nirmal's wife Sarah is equally competent. She delivers what is needed for her role with poise and confidence. Kushboo as the actress Gulaboo is bright and effective. Mounted on a shoe-string budget with moderate production values, the film is efficiently shot by cinematographer Krish Makhija and the visuals along with the soundtrack are astutely layered by the editor Pavan Bhat. Overall, 'Nirmal Anand Ki Puppy' is a warm film filled with human emotions, and most of all, it is unexpectedly moving.","

And for America's hottest television celebrity Kim Kardashian, it's no different. Her nasty divorce with Kanye West and her newly blossomed loved with Pete Davidson has been hitting the headlines for the past year. Kanye, now kno wn as Ye, has even gone to the extent of harassing his ex-wife. West has been using his social media handles as a weapon to slander Kim and her current partner, comedian and Saturday Night Live star Pete Davidson, even referring to him as 'Skete.' While the rapper is indulged in full-fledged harassment against his estranged wife, the media has completely failed to address the seriousness of the issue. Both publications and netizens are just keen to make it 'just another tabloid fodder.' Be it the love-bombing pictures or the leaked private conversations, West seems to be struggling with his mental health that needs immediate attention. Let's take a look at the timeline of events that took things beyond the run-of-the-mill celebrity messiness. Kim Kardashian and Kanye West tied the wedding knots in May 2014. Often considered as the perfect couple with four kids, their marriage started hitting the rocks in 2020. Finally, in February 2021, the television mogul filed for divorce.

West has been linked with multiple women including Julia Fox but the rapper seems to be obsessed with his ex-wife. Davidson and West share a long rivalry. Way back in 2018 when West replaced Ariana Grande for an SNL appearance, he wore a controversial red 'Make America Great Again' hat expressing his support for Donald Trump. In the following week's update, David called the unaired pro-Trump speech as 'worst thing I've ever seen.' Things took a turn when Kim and Pete acted in a skit as Jasmine and Aladdin, they even kissed on the lips. Days later, the couple was seen holding hands at a park on Halloween weekend. Rumours of dating became stronger. Kanye West told Hollywood Unlocked that he was stopped from entering Kim Kardashian's house:“My daughter wanted me to go inside. I was like, I am the richest black man and North's father, right, and the security was able to stop me from going into the room with my daughter.” pic.twitter.com/o066xLOHJE ""This is for anybody that's going through a separation. People intentionally do things to be mean and to hurt you and they be playing games, and culturally it's OK. How are you gonna bring me to SNL and kiss the dude you dating right in front of me?"" Ye was quoted by Hollywood Unlocked. He also alledged that he was stopped by Kim's guards from taking part in daughter's birthday celebration. In January 2022, Ye launched a music war against Pete. His new song 'Eazy' leaked and the lyrics caught the attention of all. ""God saved me from that crash / Just so I can beat Pete Davidson's ass (Who?),"" he rapped. In another single ""City of Gods,"" featuring Ye and Alicia Keys he rapped again, ""This afternoon, a hundred goons pullin' up to SNL, when I pull up, it's dead on arrival."" JUST IN: Kanye leaks text messages with Pete Davidson‼️? pic.twitter.com/XZwIUmdZTs In February, West leaked his private conversation with David. The now-deleted post reads David's text as ""And you as a man. I'd never get in the way of your children. It's a promise. How you guys go about raising your children is your business not mine. I do hope one I day I can meet them and we can all be friends."" He captioned the post as ""No, you will never meet my children.""

He later urged his fans not to hurt Pete. He also shared screenshots of text messages from Kim to stop creating a dangerous environment for Pete.

West celebrated it as a victory and wrote, ""Ran Skete off the gram, Tell your mother I changed your name for life."" Kanye's 'Easy' graphic video raised the alarm. It showcased West kidnapping an animated clay version of the comedian, tying it and burying it alive. The caption reads, ""EVERYONE LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER / EXCEPT SKETE YOU KNOW WHO / JK HE'S FINE."" The video raised serious concerns about harassment and Kanye's mental health. When criticisms poured in, he used art therapy as a shield. ""Art is therapy just like this view, art is protected as freedom of speech, art inspires and simplifies the world. Art is not a proxy for any ill or harm. Any suggestion otherwise about my art is false and mal intended.""

What happened The singer was lying on a floor wearing a black lace bodysuit. While there was one snake on her body, another one was being placed when the incident occurred.

'Dune', with four mentions in the same categories except Song was close behind, reports deadline.com. The Oscars shortlists cover 10 categories overall, including Documentary Feature; International Film; Animated, Live Action, and Documentary Shorts; Make-up and Hairstyling; Music Score; Original Song; Sound; and Visual Effects. Denmark's 'Flee' made the cut for both Documentary Feature and International Film. It is also eligible for Animated Feature (not a shortlisted category) this year, and should it eventually score final nominations in all three categories, it will set an Oscar record for that triple play, reports deadline.com. Although there weren't many surprises this morning, for some the most shocking omission will likely be in International Feature, where French entry and Cannes Film Festival Palme d'Or winner 'Titane' from Director Julia Ducournau missed the cut after she became only the second woman ever (after Jane Campion) to win the Palme. Her film contains some extreme violence that might have turned off some Academy voters viewing the film on Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) digital platform. ""I had predicted more than a few might not make it through the entire film."" Home viewing probably hurt this one, as well as Romanian entry and Berlin Film Festival Golden Bear winner 'Bad Luck Banging' or 'Loony Porn, which opens with a hardcore sex tape for its first 10 minutes. It would be interesting to see how many voters got past that beginning for the critically praised Berlin winner. In terms of multiple mentions, which bode well for eventual nominations in other categories as well, the aforementioned Campion's 'The Power of the Dog' has three, and such big blockbuster titles like 'Spider Man: No Way Home' and 'The Matrix: Resurrections' are among those with two. It is a big day for Billie Eilish, who is the subject of a feature documentary that made the cut, as well as co-writer and singer of the shortlisted title song of 'No Time to Die'. In the latter category there are some big names competing for one of the five eventual slots, including Brian Wilson, Beyonce, Jay-Z, Sparks, Arianda Grande, Bono, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Jennifer Hudson, Carole King and perennial bridesmaid Diane Warren eligible to grab her 13th nomination in the category for 'Somehow You Do' from the little-seen 'Four Good Days'. Final nominations will be announced on February 8. The Oscars are scheduled to take place on March 27 at the Dolby Theatre.","

As expected, Marvel has offered an ultimate visual treat for viewers in this movie. But is this new Spidey movie all about visuals? Certainly not. This Jon Watts directorial is one of the best movies ever made by Marvel in recent years, and it literally takes audiences to a fun ride along with some unexpected twists, mind-blowing action scenes, and touching emotional sequences.  Three eras of Spider-Man in one movie The trailer of the movie had indicated that Spider-Man: No Way Home will bring three eras of Spider-Man in one movie. Called Marvel's Multiverse, we can witness Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, Sandman, Lizard, and Electro, all coming together to attack the Spidey.  No Way Home begins from where the 2019 film Far From Home ended. As Mysterio broadcasted the real Spider-Man's identity, there is a media frenzy going on. Spider-Man soon becomes a global superhero, and it is at this moment that he seeks the help of Doctor Strange. As Doctor Strange casts a spell to hide Spider-Man's identity, Spidey's nervous nattering ruins the enchantment, and everyone who knows him comes from various universes.  Encashing the nostalgia The film is brilliant in all aspects. However, the ultimate X-factor is that the director succeeded in encashing nostalgia, as old villains from previous Spider-Man movies came together in one single flick.  It is a real treat to watch Spider-Man fighting against evil, and the film ended with a massive climax. As usual, Tom Holland nailed the show, and he was given ample support by co-actors. The special effects used in the movie are excellent, but at times, the graphics went a little over the board.  Final Verdict Spider-Man: No Way Home could be undoubtedly your perfect pick for this weekend. Go for it and enjoy the multiverse ride with Spidey. ","

Its recent attempt to do so is different. On one hand, it talks of big words like climate change and extinction of life on earth and on the other, it admits to being dark and comical about the not-so-good news coming in the way of its audience. Talking to LA Times, filmmaker Adam McKay of Vice fame told his reason behind wrapping a serious idea of climate crisis in a comic satire packaging.  ""I'd been trying to find a way to crack the story of the climate crisis and I'd written a bunch of different treatments. Some were 'Twilight Zone'-type thrillers, some were character pieces. But none of them felt like they fully landed with that big open door you need for an idea like this,"" he said adding, ""It's absolutely ridiculous that we don't address it to a degree where it's almost funny and at the same time wildly upsetting."" Dr. Mindy keeps it ? or actually 99.78% to be specific. #DontLookUp, watch the new film from Adam McKay in select theaters now and on @netflix December 24. pic.twitter.com/tBeLHFUvwd Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Dr. Randall Mindy in the film felt it is a film that comes once in a generation and he knew he had to be a part of it. ""The movie was really an exercise in looking at how we as a species deal with bad news: how it becomes politicized, how we become distracted by social media alternative facts, how people who devote their lives to speaking the truth, whether it be COVID or the climate crisis, are marginalized,"" he told LA Times. The film, releasing on Netflix on December 24, promises of a star-studded affair with Jennifer Lawrence as Kate Dibiasky, an unpopular astronomer, Meryl Streep as US President Janie Orlean, Arianna Grande, Chris Evans as Devin Peters and Cate Blanchett, who appears to be a TV anchor named Brie Evantee. Don't Look Up also stars Indian-origin British actor and musician Himesh Jitendra Patel of Tenet fame. When asked what the actors of the film would do for real, in their final moments if the world was to end at all in six months, the Academy award-winning Silver Lining Playbook actress replied, ""Adam and I would both chain smoke."" While the Titanic star DiCaprio hints at a clinching dinner table scene, ""We're a communal species, and I would want to be around people I love and ignore the impending Armageddon.

742,2021-12-07,12:27:48,entertainment,hollywood,Drake abruptly withdraws two Grammy nominations without citing reasons," Drake has withdrawn his two 2022 Grammy nominations, a rep for the Recording Academy has confirmed to 'Variety'. Drake's rep did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Sources told 'Variety' that the decision was made by Drake and his management and the Grammys honored the request, although his motivation was unclear at the time of the publication of this news story. Drake was one of five nominees for Best Rap Album, for 'Certified Lover Boy', and for Best Rap Performance, for his song 'Way 2 Sexy' (featuring Future and Young Thug). Some have speculated that Drake's decision might have something to do with him being named in lawsuits surrounding the tragedy at the Astroworld festival in Houston last month, where 10 people died when the crowd rampaged during headliner Travis Scott's set, which featured a guest appearance from Drake. The rapper, though, is scheduled to perform with Kanye West at the 'Free Larry Hoover' benefit concert in Los Angeles on Thursday, so that explanation feels unlikely, according to 'Variety'. Drake has had a long and at times contentious relationship with the Grammys. Just a year ago, he called for them to be replaced with ""something new that we can build up over time and pass on to the generations to come"", after it failed to recognise his peer and fellow Canadian artiste, the Weeknd, in 2021.","

746,2021-11-25,16:21:13,entertainment,hollywood,Steve Burton fired from 'General Hospital' for 'no vax' stance; releases statement [read now]," 'General Hospital' star Steve Burton has confirmed on Instagram the rumours that he was fired from the long-running soap opera because he would not get vaccinated against Covid-19. ""I wanted you to hear it from me personally."" he said, reports variety.com. He added: ""Unfortunately, 'General Hospital' has let me go because of the vaccine mandate. I did apply for my medical and religious exemptions, and both of those were denied. Which, you know, hurts. But this is also about personal freedom to me."" Burton then went on to express gratitude to the show, where he's played Jason Morgan on and off since 1991. He said: ""Maybe one day if these mandates are lifted, I can return and finish my career as Jason Morgan. That would be an honor."" On Monday, Variety reported that it appeared that Burton might have been fired from the show because of this issue. The vaccine mandate for Zone A at 'General Hospital', which comprises those present on set when the actors aren't wearing masks, and the actors themselves went into effect on November 1. Actor Ingo Rademacher, whose Instagram is full of vaccine misinformation and propaganda, loudly refused to comply with the vaccine mandate. His final episode on the show aired Monday. After Burton's post on Instagram, the channel confirmed that his departure was because of his non-compliance with the show's vaccine mandate. Burton's ouster had been rumoured in the 'General Hospital' fandom for weeks. He had tested positive for Covid in mid-August, saying he'd been ""exposed at work"". During that time, the in-fighting at the show about Covid protocols spilled into the public, and resulted in the vaccine mandate. Of the four daytime dramas remaining on the networks, 'General Hospital', which is owned by ABC, is the only one that has instituted a vaccine mandate. 'Days of Our Lives', and 'The Young and the Restless' and 'The Bold and the Beautiful' continue to rely on testing, social distancing and other CDC-recommended guidelines for their on-set protocols. Recasting popular characters on soap operas and dead characters coming back to life are endemic to the genre. In the past, the Jason character has been played by other actors, as Burton has pursued other projects. On Friday's episode of 'General Hospital', a tunnel collapsed on Jason, which gave even more fuel to fans' theories that Burton had been fired.","

She wants to be known only as 'Priyanka'. And from what we hear she may spell 'Priyanka' in a different way from now on. Apparently, it is an astrological decision,"" said the report.

On Friday, November 12, a Los Angeles judge hearing her case ended the conservatorship set up by the 39-year-old singer's father with immediate effect. ""Good God I love my fans so much it's crazy. I think I'm gonna cry the rest of the day !!!! Best day ever ... praise the Lord ... can I get an Amen #FreedBritney,"" tweeted an elated Britney Spears as her nearly 14-year-long conservatorship by father James Spears was put to end by an LA court. She did so while sharing a video of her fans celebrating her victory, captured by Abby Shalawylo. Fans gathered outside the LA court to support Spears, who had described the guardianship as abusive, reported BBC adding that her father Jamie had earlier said it was ""necessary"", but agreed it was time for her ""to re-take control of her life"". The legal conservatorship was put in place in 2008 after concerns were raised about Spears' mental welfare after several incidents post her divorce from Kevin Federline in 2007. The binding restricted her power over her finances, career decisions and personal matters including remarriage and meeting her own children. As part of the Friday ruling, Judge Brenda Penny also declared that an accountant who served as a temporary conservator should retain some powers to settle ongoing financial issues, revealed the BBC report. Britney Spears' fiance, Sam Asghari, also took to social media to celebrate his lover's freedom. In an Instagram post, he stated, ""History was made today. Britney is free."" A post shared by Sam Asghari (@samasghari) Earlier, before the judgment and the breaking of the news, the couple posted a cute video posing in t-shirts that read '#freebritney. It's a human rights movement'. The couple had announced their engagement on social media on September 13 this year and according to reports, wedding preparations are underway.

The petition was started by Bandar Albuliwi, a graduate of the American Film Institute (AFI) Conservatory in Los Angeles and director of a feature film titled Peace after Marriage, in the wake of the recent Hollywood tragedy on the sets of the film Rust. On October 21st, 2021 we lost an unbelievably talented cinematographer on the film set of RUST, due to a real gun being discharged with live ammunition in it. I am in shock and numb to my core. The bullet also wounded Director Joel Souza, the online petition by Albuliwi stated.  The tragic incident took the life of 42-year-old Ukrainian cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, a former AFI student (2015 batch). Albuliwi, who passed out from AFI in 2010, five years before Halyna Hutchins stated in his appeal, ""Like everyone in the 'AFI Family', we all knew one another. AFI is a very small community of filmmakers, trying their hardest to get their 'big break' in the film industry after graduating from the program."" Halyna who was named as a 'Rising Star Cinematographer' in 2019, was finally breaking into the Hollywood film industry after hustling and shooting amazing content for half a decade. Although she had shot three feature films before this one, Rust was going to be her big break with an A-listed celebrity.  The online petition has been put in place to make much-needed noise around the issue of real and unsafe firearms on film sets and demand for Alec Baldwin to use his power and influence in the Hollywood film industry to make the change and ban real guns on film sets. It also attempts to bring light on the ""horrendous"" working conditions of those working on Hollywood films and making independent cinema.  The petition has received much support within just two days of going online on the platform, Change.org. Jane Potelle, who signed the petition, wrote, ""My husband works in VFX and he and his co-workers have no idea why anyone would use actual firing props with today's post technology. There's just no need for it anymore. You can get all the great effects done in post."" Another respondent, Elizabeth James opined, ""Filmmakers with this little regard for protocol, oversight, and experience shouldn't be funded to make films, and production companies who have such little regard for union work/safety should be put out of business.""","

The Ukrainian Director of Photography (DOP) who grew up on a Soviet military base, worked on documentary films in Eastern Europe before studying film in Los Angeles and embarking on a promising movie-making career revealed an Associated Press report. Till Friday evening, Halyna was just the cinematographer who was shot dead by Alec Baldwin with a prop gun as per most media outlets. But as the news spread, friends, co-workers, and her peers took to their social media accounts to remind that the tragic accident wasn't so much about Alec Baldwin, the 'celeb star' but the mother, wife, and gifted cinematographer who lost her precious life.  Dr. Jennifer Cassidy, Co-Founder Ox Digital Diplomacy Group shared on her Twitter: ""Rest in Peace Halyna Hutchins. The cinematographer who died when Alec Baldwin fired a prop gun and wounded the director. Yes, Alec Baldwin is trending. But it's Halyna Hutchins who lost her life."" The incident that occurred on the sets of upcoming Hollywood film Rust starring Alec Baldwin was being shot near Santa Fe, New Mexico. The tragic ""discharge"" of a prop gun in the 63-year-old celebrity actor's hands, shot dead Hutchins, the woman behind the camera and injured the film director Joel Souza. Court records released Friday indicated that an assistant director handed Baldwin a loaded weapon and told him it was safe to use, further stated the AP report. Reacting to the death of a gifted film person, late Brandon Bruce Lee's official Twitter page handled by his sister Shannon Lee commented on the tragic incident that was similar to the one in 1993 that took the life of actor Bruce Lee's 28-year-old son Brandon Lee.  ""Our hearts go out to the family of Halyna Hutchins and to Joel Souza and all involved in the incident on Rust,"" read the message from the account adding, ""No one should ever be killed by a gun on a film set. Period."" According to an LATimes report back then, the actor was killed when co-star Michael Massee fired a prop gun in which a fragment of a bullet remained. Amongst many who came out in support of 'rockstar' Hutchins's tragic death and her family's grave loss was American filmmaker and camera developer Elle Schneider. She wrote on Twitter demanding answers: ""Sick and devastated to hear that my friend and rockstar cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was killed on set today in New Mexico. I don't have words to describe this tragedy. I want answers. I want her family to somehow find peace among this horrific, horrific loss."" Joining Schneider in the quest for answers and a proper investigation, Nell Scovel added her bit reinstating that this one doesn't deserve a Hollywood cover-up. Only 5% of film cinematographers are women which tells you how talented and driven Halyna Hutchins had to be to make it in her field. We need a full account of what happened on that set. No Hollywood cover up. According to the media outlet Deadline who published a statement from film director Joel Souza, a search warrant is out from the Santa Fe Sherriff's office as to whether footage of the fatal accident exists.  Production of the film, reportedly co-written by Baldwin, has closed down for an underdetermined amount of time as an internal investigation is being conducted on the grave matter. In addition to the local Sheriff's Department, this incident is also being investigated by the New Mexico Occupational Health and Safety Bureau, which can impose civil penalties for workplace accidents even if law enforcement determines that no crime occurred, further stated the Deadline report.","

764,2021-09-18,12:29:54,entertainment,hollywood,"Movie Review of Don't Breathe 2: Not as good as the first edition, fails to make you immerse in story"," Film: Don't Breathe 2 (Showing in Theatres) Duration: 100 minutes Director: Rodo Sayagues Cast: Stephen Lang, Brendan Sexton III, Madelyn Grace, Adam Young, Bobby Schifield, Rocci Williams and Stephanie Arcila. Movie Rating: *** Despite being a skilfully crafted horror-thriller with nail-biting suspense and gore, 'Don't Breathe 2' fails to deliver the immersive experience of its first edition, which was released in 2016. The first edition was a simple story of a burglary gone awry, but this one is a bit more complex. Taking place about eight years after the last film, the plot is not about just some intruders in the same terrifying house of a blind man, who is now living with Phoenix (Madelyn Grace), a girl in her early teens. Norman Nordstrom (Stephen Lang), the blind Navy Seal veteran is fiercely overprotective of Phoenix who we are made to believe is his daughter. She is lonely and rebellious. When Nordstrom is talked into letting the girl go into town, she is noticed by a strange man who sets a chain of events into motion and the motive of these intruders is much more devious than mere burglary. Initially, with Nordstrom having to save himself and Phoenix from the three intruders who are pure sociopaths, comes closest to echoing the first edition, which is fairly standard. The intruders appear birdbrained. During one of the face-offs, Jared (Bobby Schofield) winds up with his lips and nose sealed with some sort of glue. His dimwitted comrade Jim Bob (Adam Young) pierces a screwdriver through his cheeks so that Jared may breathe. The trio was sent to the Nordstrom house by Raylan (Brendan Sexton III) who had an agenda of his own. Deaths and gore are just a natural progression to the plot. While the actors are all-natural and sincere in their performances, which make the film look real, it is their cardboard-thin characters that allow the suspension of disbelief. The novelty factor is no more in Stephen Lang's Norman Nordstrom. He is still intimidating but appears tired and jaded. Madelyn Grace as Phoenix is cute and lovable. Stephanie Arcila in a small role, as Hernandez the veteran army ranger and Norman's only connection with society, is poised and polished. The action sequences are intensely pulsating and gory in parts, and for most of the parts you can anticipate the result. The scene that stands out is when Nordstrom acts dead lying in the shallow pool of water, and he responds to the ripples created. Cinematographer Pedro Luque's camera work is certainly worth mentioning. Each frame in the film, with its atmospheric lighting, is picture perfect and visually stimulating but the pulse is missing due to the convolutedly woven drama.","

Netizens called the concept ""flawed"" and called it ""performance activism"". Many were shocked at the whole concept and called it out for trivializing activism. Following the outcry, CBS had announced that they have decided to change the format to one-time documentary. ""I have been moved by the power of your voices over the past week. At its core, Activism is fuelled by cause and effect, and when people come together to raise their voice about something, there is always an effect. You were heard,"" Priyanka wrote. ""The show got it wrong and I am sorry that my participation disappointed many of you. The intention was always to bring attention to people behind the ideas and the highlight the action and impact of the causes they support tirelessly. I'm happy to know that in this new format, their stories will be the highlight, and I'm proud to collaborate with partners who have their ear to the ground and know when it's time to hit pause and re-evaluate,"" she further wrote.

766,2021-08-15,12:23:45,entertainment,hollywood,Releasing Vin Diesel's F9 in Indian theaters could be a bad idea due to these factors," F9, the highly anticipated Hollywood movie starring Vin Diesel in the lead role is expected to have its theatrical release in India on September 03. The ninth installment in the Fast and Furious franchise, this film already had its premiere in various other countries like the United States, Russia, Canada, and South Korea. As this Justin Lin directorial is reaching India, certain factors could negatively affect the film's theatrical run.  A potential third wave and piracy issues Even though the second wave of the Covid pandemic has waned in India, medical experts and authorities have predicted a potential third wave that could hit the nation soon. Several recent studies had suggested that the third wave of the pandemic could hit India by the end of August. If a third wave outbreak happens in India, it will negatively impact the release of F9, and even if theaters remain functional, people will be hesitant to visit the big screens. In states like Kerala where Hollywood movies enjoy a decent theatrical run, theaters are still closed and considering the recent spike in Covid, there is no hope that big screens in the state will open soon.  Another factor that will negatively impact the theatrical run of F9 in India is piracy. The film's pirated version was readily available on Telegram just hours after the movie's theatrical release in the United States. Even though piracy is illegal, several people have already watched the film, and only those who wish to enjoy a big-screen experience are likely to visit the theaters on September 03.  F9: A film that set several pandemic box-office records Amid receiving criticisms for its unrealistic action sequences, F9 is now the third highest-grossing film in 2021. Made with a budget of $200 million, the film has already grossed over $600 million worldwide.  Apart from Vin Diesel, F9 is loaded with an ensemble star cast that includes John Cena, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, Michael Rooker, Helen Mirren, Kurt Russell, and Charlize Theron.  Recently, Vin Diesel had confirmed that the shooting of the 10th installment of the Fast and Furious franchise will begin soon. ","

Mack pleaded guilty to the charges of manipulating women into sex with the spiritual group's leader. Mack acknowledged her role in manipulating women to become sexual slaves for group leader Keith Raniere. The cult-like group Nxivm was a secret society where women were brainwashed to have sexual relations with the spiritual guru. The women were also branded with his initials. Mack called her act ""the biggest mistake"" of her life. She also said it was her ""greatest regret"". ""I made choices I will forever regret,"" The Guardian quoted her saying. Allison sought an apology from the women she had manipulated and brought into the group. Seeking forgiveness, Mack said, ""I am sorry to those of you that I brought into Nxivm. I am sorry I ever exposed you to the nefarious and emotionally abusive schemes of a twisted man. From the deepest part of my heart and soul, I am sorry."" Allison was an inner member of the NXIVM cult and brought millionaire women and actors into the bogus spiritual circle. The people were asked to take nude photographs, were made to do manual labor, and were also directed to engage in sexual acts with Keith Raniere. ""The Nxivm saga and the story of Ms Mack's descent have been a tragedy for all involved. But that need not, and should not, be the end of the story for Allison Mack,"" her lawyer had pleaded in court. Under suspicion, Raniere had fled to Mexico with Allison Mack and other members of the inner circle. However, he was arrested and sent to the US. Keith was charged with 120 years in prison for sex trafficking.","

777,2021-06-23,13:08:10,entertainment,hollywood,From Slasher to Monsters: Five movie genres that still remain unexplored in India," The film industry all around the world is evolving, and filmmakers, especially from western countries and nations like South Korea are experimenting with various genres. When it comes to budget, technology, and global reach, Hollywood always stands top, but with the advent of OTT platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Disney+, Indian movies too have now the opportunity to audiences from different nooks of the world.  Even in this era of opportunity, most Indian filmmakers are obsessed with making those cliched commercial potboilers where the hero will trash the antagonist with his iron fist and ultra-flexible legs. Amid huge potential, Indian storytellers and directors are still hesitant to explore several genres that have humongous potential to impress global audiences.  International Business Times, India edition presents you with the list of five unexplored genres Indian directors are yet to explore completely.  Slasher Slasher can be considered as a sub-genre of horror films. Unlike horror movies where jumpscare moments used to scare audiences, slasher movies often panic the viewers with blood-spilling scenes. Even though India has also produced some slasher films like Nayanthara's Kolayuthir Kaalam, directors in the nation are yet to explore this genre to the fullest.  Monster Monster films have a huge fan following in all nooks of the world. Hollywood movies like Jurassic Park, King Kong, and Godzilla have broken several collection records in India, but filmmakers in the nation are still reluctant to make movies in this genre. Industry experts believe that limited budget and lack of technical expertise are the two major factors that negatively impact Indian filmmakers' attempt to make movies in the 'monster' genre.  Disaster Who will forget films like 2012 and Day After Tomorrow. These films have a huge fan following in India, but Indian filmmakers have not taken that daring step to make movies in this genre. And obviously, the reason is the same; limited budget and lack of technical expertise.  Adventure Even though Bollywood filmmakers have a fair share of adventure films like Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara and Karwan, Indian directors have not taken that giant leap to make big movies in this genre. However, Barroz, a Mollywood movie directed by Mohanlal is aiming to fill this void space.  Science fiction Science fiction is another genre that Bollywood filmmakers have not explored much. Even though there are a handful of films, no filmmakers have tried making a sci-fi flick in India that will impress global audiences. ","

Fans and followers of contestant Brent Draper were left teary-eyed when he decided to quit the show. A first in the Masterchef Australia history, Draper revealed the pressure was tremendous and took a toll on his mental well-being. Brent, who wowed the judges with his brilliant chicken cooking styles and flavours, had left his wife and two-year-old son to be on the show. However, the continuous pressure and struggle to compete took a toll on him. Brent's decision to quit has come as a rude awakening for those who say reality shows are not real.  Brent's social media post Brent shared a picture of him putting his hand up and wrote, ""This is the moment I put my hand up, and asked for help. This is the moment I'll never forget, and one I'm bloody proud of. This is the moment I put my mental health first, before anything else. This is the moment I want my son Alfie to see, I want him to see that it's okay to not be okay, it's okay to hurt and it's okay to cry. This is the moment that changed everything for me. If you need help, please call @lifelineaustralia on 13 11 14."" Having a lot of panic attacks Even though Brent is better now, there was a phase where he was getting panic attacks and was really struggling. ""The last few weeks of my time in the competition, I was really struggling mentally and physically. I was struggling to sleep and having a lot of panic attacks during the night. It really started to show; even though I was trying my hardest to mask it, those around me knew I wasn't OK,"" Draper told The Guardian.  Brent further said, ""What we go through emotionally and mentally on this show is massively underestimated. People put their entire lives on hold for this, they leave their children and their newborn babies and their partners and jobs to chase something that most people will never be able to have a crack at in their lives.""  After quitting the show, Brent spent a good amount of time sitting with a psychologist, doing things he loved and spending quality time with his family. He has also urged people on social media to ""put their hands up"" if they feel something is not right or if they are not able to cope up.","

The ladies had promised each other, that men may come and go but soulmates remain forever. It's been over a decade since that promise was made, and it looks like in the reboot of the series wishes will be fulfilled.  The three ladies from Sex and the City, Carrie, Miranda, and Charlotte, (Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis) have rejoined again for the 10 episodes reboot of the series which will take place in New York again. Sarah Jessica Parker shared a photo of them in the backdrop of New York's Empire State Building.  New York is important part of show The films Sex and the City failed to be as popular as the series since the viewers hardly got a glimpse of New York from the perspective of the four women. The first film was based on Big and Carrie's marriage, where the latter got ditched at the altar, and the four friends took a trip to Mexico. In the second film, the four friends explored Dubai more than New York.   Sarah Jessica Parker had promised that New York will be the fourth character in the reboot franchise. The four girls from Sex and the City had fallen in love with the Big Apple city with all the flaws it had with herself. Samatha Jones had once commented that she often wonders when people leave New York where exactly do they go?  A post shared by SJP (@sarahjessicaparker) In the final season of Sex and the City, when Carrie Bradshaw left New York to settle in Paris, despite living in the city of love, she was unable to feel the love that she had received in New York. ","

The gritty crime thriller revolves around the lives of the Atwal's and DCP Ghosh and picks up right from its left in the last season. With powerhouse performers like Dibyendu Bhattacharya, Harsh Chhaya, Apeksha Porwal, Surya Sharma, Ankur Rathee the show also has some new faces this season. Nandish Sandhu joined the series as Samarth and Meiyang Chang also makes an entry as Abhay. The plot thickens As this season picks up pace, the plot delves into the chase between Rinku Atwal and Koyal. New characters are introduced and new plot twists keep us intrigued. And then enters Samarth who plays the link between the Atwals and a huge pharma company that actually deals in illegal drugs. Though there are a few loopholes in this season as compared to the sleeper hit that the previous season was, the absorbing performances of the cast make it a must-watch. Superlative performances Harsh Chhaya as Papaji is still at his best. Surya Sharma rides the show on his hunky shoulders. We were left a bit disappointed by the absence of Dibyendu in some of the episodes but the new cast more than makes up for it. Meiyang Chang proves his mettle as an actor and Nandish Singh Sandhu couldn't have chosen a better role for his digital debut. Without going caricaturish or loud, Nandish leaves a mark with his authoritative body language. Shivangi Singh who played the role of Muskaan and Vaarun Bhaat who played Lucky are the two to watch out for in the next season. Unlike many other second seasons of hit first season shows, Undekhi throws in all the formulas to add itself to the list of 2022 must-watch shows. And we would say that it manages to do that just right.","

But I will be very careful while choosing the remaining eight participants. For example, I will include an ex-army man, a retired police officer, a farmer, a lawyer, a teacher and a doctor.""  Some other names that are considered possible contestants in Bigg Boss Malayalam 4 are TikTok influencer Pala Saji, snake catcher Vava Suresh, and actor Jiya Irani. ","

793,2022-02-17,13:39:59,entertainment,television,Arjan Bajwa on Bestseller: It took me some time to come onboard [Exclusive]," Arjan Bajwa, Shruti Haasan, Gauahar Khan, and Mithun Chakraborty's 'Bestseller' is all set for a grand release on February, 18. The show would be available for streaming on Amazon Prime. The thriller series already looks promising and the social media reaction to it proves how audiences are waiting for this one. International Business Times, India, got in touch with Bestseller actor, Arjan Bajwa to talk about the show, his role, working with Mithun Chakraborty, sequels and more. What was your reaction on listening to the script? Were you immediately onboard? I was pretty excited when I heard the script as it is quite an intriguing and elaborate story. But, after reading it, it took me some time to get onboard. That was because I wanted to know who the director was and what the plan of the whole shoot was. I was interested in knowing how it was going to be projected and many facets of the whole filmmaking process. So, as a story, I was excited but it took me a little time to figure out rest of the aspects to come onboard. How was it working with Mithun Chakraborty? Does the vibe and mood on the set changes when you are working with such veteran actors? Yes, it becomes even better. That's because you learn from veteran actors and people like Mithun Chakraborty who has been a star for many decades. The vibe changes, yes, in a way that you have to maintain a certain decorum and be respectful. The kind of accomplishments that come with them, you have to be at your best to grasp, absorb and learn how they are. But, I would say, Mithun sir was extremely humble and happy on the sets and kept the atmosphere light and comfortable for everyone. Out of all the platforms, which one do you prefer the most? To shoot, to be on the set, filming is the most favorite thing of mine. Now, whether that comes as a film or an OTT series that is something I don't give preference to. But, to be an actor, to be filming continuously is what I prefer. What's your take on sequels? Would we see a sequel to Bestseller? Yeah! If the story is incomplete and if you have more to say to that story, why not. Definitely, there should be a sequel and there should be more of that story to tell people. Yes, there are things being planned and written. Once you watch the series, you would realize that it has been left at a little ambiguous ending. So, I am sure the audience would want to see more of it as the story is not over yet. When you are a part of a dark show like this, do you take it back home? Does that character stay with you for some time or is it a switch on and off mode for you? This is not a dark show. Once you watch it you would realize that it is not that kind of a dark, violent, gory show. It is more about a thriller that is incorporated into drama. But, talking about shooting whether it is a dark show or a light-hearted one, you have to switch off at some point. You can't bring back your work. Otherwise, you get too absorbed in that mold. And it is impossible for any normal human being to carry out your daily routine if you are engrossed only in the character that you have played. Has this role or any other role you have played changed or influenced you as a person? No, not at all. I don't delve into roles that much. Apart from justifying what I am doing, I don't go beyond that. Otherwise, it takes a toll on your mental health. Do you feel you are yet to get your due as an actor? Most certainly, because inspite of being a part of many hit films, I feel the best is yet to come.","

However, with his phenomenal performances in both, Aranyak and Human, Indraneil has carved a niche for himself. International Business Times, India, got in touch with the actor on the two shows, his journey so far, and more. Both Aranyak and Human were starkly different in their plots yet had a common theme of dark drama with implications to human life. How does it feel to be a part of something that people have loved and appreciated? It feels wonderful to be a part of a successful show and I am delighted that both Aranyak and Human have been so widely loved. Both are thrillers and as we all know, a good thriller, more often than not, is able to engage the viewers and entertain them. What really worked for these two shows was the exploration of the human angle of all the characters. You starred with some strong female actors in both shows – Raveena in one and Shefali Shah, Kirti in another, what was the experience like? I think it's always the story that is important and it really doesn't make a difference who is driving it forward, man or woman. In both these shows, the protagonists were women and this was just incidental in the context of the story. I never felt there was an attempt at making any statement. And no, I don't feel there is any change in the vibe when a woman is the lead. Any incident you would like to share about working with Kriti, Shefali or Raveena? Raveena, Kirti and Shefali, all of them are absolute fun to work with. I can't mention any specific incident but I truly enjoyed working with them and there was a lot to gain from watching them at close quarters. How would you describe your journey in the industry so far? Do you feel you are yet to get your due as an actor? My journey has been slow and steady, but most importantly, it has been of constant growth. I don't think as an actor I'll ever feel I have got my due. I always feel there's more to give, more to explore, more to grow. But I am happy that I am getting to do the kind of work I always wished to. Are you competitive when it comes to your peers and the work they are doing? I am competitive in a certain way. I don't think I ever compete with another actor and try to do better than anyone. That's not my approach. I might envy someone for the kind of work he/she is doing. When I watch a great performance or act with a great actor, I do get envious of his/her ability and talent and I start asking myself when will I be able to reach that level of performance. You made a significant mark on OTT with major series, but smaller roles – why did you agree for the same? I feel my mindset is more of an actor now. I am trying to give my best to any role that I play. These roles chose me, I didn't choose them. And I have been able to do an honest job of it only because I was happy playing those characters, irrespective of the length of the roles.","

Later, they couldn't get the right fit for Bheem as his height, body and personality would have to be bigger than Duryodhana, so Chopra saab jokingly told me, 'If we don't get the right Bheem, we will cast you in the role!'

Rashmi has won rave reviews for her role as Pooja Sikhera, wife of policeman Naveen Sikhera (played by Mohit Raina) in the show. The MX Player crime-thriller series directed by Jatin Wagle has emerged as one of the most popular shows on the streaming platforms this month. International Business Times got in touch with Rashmi Rajput to talk about the preparation she underwent to play the part, working with Mohit Raina, and more. Was there any off-camera preparation you went through to understand the character better? My character Pooja Sikhera is the wife of a police officer and to play it well, I made sure to understand the life of a police officer's wife. So I got in touch with as many people as I can to understand about their life and know about their experience, talk about how their daily life is. To be honest I have understood one thing: that the life of a policeman's wife is tougher than any one can imagine. What makes you say that? They are always worried about their husbands but they never show. To be a constant support in all situations requires anyone to be very strong-headed. A policeman's life is so tough- sometimes they have to be working 24 hours and sometimes more and still they don't have any complaints. At the same time, a policeman's wife makes sure that they can support their husband in the best way they can, and enjoy the best of the moments whenever they have time together. Hats off to both of them. Any real-life incident you took inspiration from? I had one friend of mine who married an army officer and her husband passed away some years back. Every time I meet her, there is a smile on her face and I asked how she tackles everything single-handedly. I asked her how she remains happy all the time. To which she replied 'I always knew our life was going to be full of uncertainties but I promised to never lose hope. And that was the promise I made to my husband too. So be it any situation, my smile has not faded from my face'. This was the biggest inspiration for my character and if you see carefully, even my character always has a smile on the face. How was the experience of working with Mohit Raina? It was amazing shooting with Mohit and it was a wonderful opportunity. He is a very supportive actor and a wonderful co-star. It was great sharing the stage with him and would surely like to work with him in the future. The vibe on the sets was amazing and it was a very positive atmosphere. So it was fun shooting this one.","

International Business Times got in touch with the actor to talk about the praise the show has received, the brickbats, how he was approached for the role and more. From an acting coach to an actor; how did you sign your first project? My first project was Maroon which was directed by one of my students Pulkit. He approached me with the character. Initially, it didn't interest me but he rewrote and came again because he wanted me to do that character. So I took it up and that's how I found my first project. And the second project I bagged when I opened my school, I got a call from Mukesh Chhabra Casting. They called me for Sacred Games and I auditioned for 3 characters later on I was finalized for playing Suleiman Isa. How did you come onboard Ranjish Hi Sahi? I got a call from the casting director for the role. Then the director called me and we had a productive meeting. He told me that he wants me in the show and I said okay to it as I liked the part I was being offered. A post shared by Saurabh Sachdeva (@saurabhsachdeva77) The show has divided the fans into two groups – one, loving it and the other, questioning how fair is it to portray someone's life when the person is not here to defend/stand up for herself. What do you have to say about that? See, I don't really know! I'm no one to decide what's fair and what's not. If I tell a story of someone from my point of view, some will like it and some not. I don't think there should be a problem because if I tell a story it's from my observation, my point of view, and my life experiences. So stories are inspired by life experiences, people, books, etc. Also, how can we say how realistic it was since it was based in the 70s and the show is inspired by Mahesh Bhatt's life events, not his biopic. So it's on the makers how much creative freedom they have taken to fictionalize and enhance the story. My job was to play my part to the best and hopefully, I have managed to do that. Ranjish Hi Sahi deals with all the intricacies of love there can be, yet very little is known of your personal life. Tell us about your love life. Well, I'm neither married nor in a relationship.","

The actor became a household name with his crime show that went on for decades. However, the actor has now been sitting at home with no interesting projects in his lap. He was last seen briefly in Haseen Dilruba. Shivaji shares his plight ""I won't say that I am getting many offers. Nahi hai toh nahi hai. There are one or two offers that are not interesting as well. I am from Marathi theatre, I have always done projects that I liked,"" Satam told HT. ""It's my bad luck that no powerful characters are being written. It's a loss on both sides. As an actor, I miss out on good work and the audience misses out on good actors,"" he further said. Shivaji, who is also a known face in Marathi theatres, added that the projects that are being offered to him are all cop roles. He added that he has not grown tired of doing the same role but tired of sitting at home. On being asked if he would be approached for CID if it makes a comeback, Shivaji added that he would be right at the front of it. ""Tomorrow (if) C.I.D. starts again, I'll be right in the front to do the project. I'm not tired of playing the character, but tired of being home,"" he said.

I urge people not to write or report anything stupid as you are creating a lot of grief to those dependent and close to the person you are writing about.

823,2021-10-21,18:43:04,entertainment,television,"Tabbar writer Sandeep Jain: After Kota Factory, people started trusting me more [Exclusive]"," If he made you laugh and cry, and doled out major emotions through Kota Factory in the past, with Tabbar now he kept you at the edge of your seat. A prolific writer and a phenomenal actor, Sandeep Jain talks to International Business Times about Tabbar, Kota Factory, and more. When did you start writing the script for Tabbar? What is your writing process like? The writing process started when Harman Wadala came to me with the pilot episode in September 2020. The inciting incident was so interesting that immediately I could see an ocean of emotions that could be explored through the story. I immediately said yes as it gave me the opportunity to dive deeper into human emotions and present them in an interesting way. Though enjoyable, the schedule was very hectic as the shoot deadlines were tight. I worked approximately 15 hours a day, almost every single day till the shoot wasn't complete. For me to start writing a project, the most important thing is to have a clear primary conflict and the themes associated in which I want to explore the story. Plot without themes never excites me and neither do themes without interesting plots. Thus I always try to push myself to explore various themes in an interesting way. The writing process includes many different ways depending on the type of project. Few things come from personal experience but you can't be dependent on it. I read a lot of articles and blogs around the topic which I want to explore. I talk to a lot of people who fit the universe of the story. Then there is some alone introspection time with the story/characters/situations of the show. Specifically, this show was written in lockdown. So I was constantly on calls with other co-writers. We used to discuss every possible emotion/situation which excited each one of us and could fit the story. Also from a structure point of view, there is a difference between show and movie writing. And I always keep that in mind while breaking down the story in episodes. Sandeep JainInstagram Were you expecting the show to garner such acclaim while writing it? Did you know it would create ripples? Yes, there was some form of expectation from the show from the very moment, when during the shoot I saw how the initial scenes were turning out. It gave the feel that every department was in sync with the script and felt that something good was being created. The feeling further enhanced as we moved ahead, as the music got implemented, as the edit got complete. But, having said that I never expected the response to be so good. Also during the creative process, I generally don't think much of the results. I only think if it can be enhanced in any way possible before presenting it to the audience. Rest, the amount of ripples a story can create can be told, only when the stone is thrown into the water. But the reactions are very overwhelming as it is loved both by critics as well as the audience alike. How close or detached are you to the script when you write? Kota Factory came mostly from your own experience. How about Tabbar? I am extremely attached to a script when I am writing one. Even if I am doing something else during the day apart from writing, the script keeps running in my subconscious mind. I don't know if it's good or bad, but many times, interesting ideas have popped up during these writing mini-breaks. Also while writing something, the perspective to see things around changes, and your mind unknowingly tries to keep connecting it to the story as in how it could be used. Yes, Kota Factory came from my personal experience as I have lived that life, and I have seen people around me who have gone through various issues in Kota. There were many friends of mine who did not make it to IIT while a few of my IIT Delhi batchmates were teaching in Kota itself. So I was very much well versed with the Universe and it helped. When it comes to Tabbar, I haven't faced such a dark situation and I hope no one would ever have to but I will quickly share an incident from my childhood that was close to Tabbar's inciting incident. I was in school when the goons entered our house forcibly to steal and my father was held as a hostage with a gun in his mouth for an hour. Fortunately, everything ended well but it was a horrifying night for me and everyone in my family reacted very differently trying to handle the same situation. And if I look back at it, that is what clearly defines characters under a conflicting situation. We all had the same middle-class aspiration and values and yet we were starkly so different. A post shared by SonyLIV (@sonylivindia) So the constant effort here as well as to follow each character's mind in detail, who starts at its own set of belief systems and how they evolve as the external impacts keep changing across the show. At the plot level, the story is primarily about the survival of a middle-class family. But at a deeper level, we have tried to play with morality conflicts, relationship conflicts, spiritual conflicts, which is something we all face at different scales in different situations and hence I tried to put that experience in it as well. I did quit my job after IIT Delhi quoting to my father that I am doing a startup but in reality I was trying to set my foot in Film Industry. And I was afraid to confess the truth to him before getting any success. Though I did confess after a year because of guilt. This is close to how Happy hides his IPS preparation thing from family as he is trying business. So, maybe layers like these from real life is what brought that relatability and connection to the characters. Do you think of the people who should play the part when you write the roles? I never do this and I personally don't think this is a good exercise to create fresh characters. Yes, at times I take references from real-life characters I have seen around but still I try to write a character note in detail to lock the DNA of the character. So it helps while writing as the situation changes but the DNA of the character doesn't. Also, the good actors from our industry don't want to play themselves again and again. They want to play fresh characters and it is a similar feeling like I don't want to write the same character in the scripts again and again. Every creative person needs a kick that comes from trying something new. And hence referencing should be avoided as much as possible. Has there been any change after Kota Factory in the way people perceive you? If you could share some instances. A big change was that after Kota Factory people trusted me as a writer and started taking my words more seriously, though nothing major changed in me. Main ek raat pehle bhi vaise hi baatein karta tha, ya vaise hi joke maarta tha, jitna release ke ek din baad. But that is the reality, results change perception of people. Similarly, like the moment when my IIT was cleared, the perception of people around me changed and people were like ""Iske thoughts hi kuchh alag honge."" But at the same time, the people who were close to me, nothing major changed for them because they knew my writing as well as me deeply. The major perception changed for the people who just knew me from far or were from the film industry. And it was good, because after Kota Factory, there were offers and I had an option to choose on the kind of projects I wanted to work upon. And I am happy Tabbar also received such a good response. I don't recall any interesting incident from that time but something happened recently. I am about to get married and one of the members from my in-laws extended family said, ""Ladke ne Kota Factory likha hai, toh thoughts achche hi honge uske"". Now, I am not sure how they will react to my thoughts after watching Tabbar. ""Ladka thoda light bhi hai, aur thoda dark bhi"".","

826,2021-10-17,13:25:37,entertainment,television,Amika Shail on playing bisexual and lesbian onscreen: There is always a fear [Exclusive]," From Mirzapur to Gandi Baat and now, Hai Taubba; Amika Shail has been taking on roles which are not only unconventional but also breaking the stereotype. With more projects showing a strong female voice in her upcoming projects, Amika is ready to take on the road less chartered. International Business Times got in touch with the actress to talk about her roles, her family's reaction to her characters and more. Tell us about your decision to come to Mumbai and try your luck at acting. My decision to come to Mumbai was overnight. I realized that I will not be able to make a career in singing by just sitting in Kolkata. I conveyed this to my parents and they supported me fully in this. It was after coming to Mumbai I realized that this fight has to be fought alone. I knew nobody and nothing about this industry. I had just 2 options - staying here and making my mark in the industry or go back to Kolkata. But I selected the first one and the rest is history. Then I got the opportunity to playback for a movie. I had struggled a lot for it and after years of hard work, I could finally achieve it. People started recognizing me as a singer. I was among the top 20 YouTube singers in the country. But then the transition from singing to acting happened. It was like starting my journey all over again. All these years I was putting in efforts for singing and then suddenly acting happened. Stepping into the world of acting was accidental for me. Yet I have strived hard to make a place for myself in the acting industry. From doing TV, to web series and a movie, the journey has been equally exciting and difficult. What do you think was the point where people started recognizing you? If I talk about acting in specific, then I think my role in Mirzapur2 was recognized highly by the people. I was part of this song Titar Bitar wherein I played the role of a bar singer. The role came naturally to me since I have been a singer all my life. I became emotional when the news broke of my confirmation in Mirzapur. I had watched season one in 2018 and thoroughly enjoyed it, just like the millions of fans the world over. However, being a part of the show was magical. My pulse went ticking when on my first day on the sets I saw Kaleen Bhaiyya (Pankaj Tripathi), Guddu (Ali Fazal) and Munna (Divyendu). I loved working with the stellar cast and crew. I learned a lot watching Pankaj ji acting as he has a very raw way of doing things. His perspective as an artist is amazing. I shared the screen Divyendu and that particular scene has become a hit among the audience. After Mirzapur 2, I have been fortunate enough to be a part of many good series like Chattis aur Maina on Disney Plus Hotstar and Gandi Baat 5 and Hai Taubba on Alt Balaji, and the movie Laxxmi with Akshay Kumar. God has been really kind to bless me with such roles. While there are many who don't prefer going bold given the fear of being stereotyped. Did you have to overcome any such thought, advice? My entry into acting had been very unplanned. I have no formal training in acting which is contrary to my singing career. I have been training as a singer since the age of 5. However, when I was called for the first acting audition and then I decided to step into the acting world, I never had these preconceived notions. Acting just happened and I bagged one role after the other. I never have faced this fear of being stereotyped. All the roles that I have played to date are very different from each other. I have done horror, I have done comedy, I have done thrillers and none of them was a repetition of what I have done earlier. Even if I have played a role that requires me to give bold scenes on the screen, it has always been only for the demand of the script. All these scenes were never imposed in the script or done just for the sake of it. But yes, there is always a fear of the way these scenes would turn out on the screen. Most of my bold shots are only suggestive. I make sure I discuss my comfort level with the production before the start of the shoot. I believe the kind of roles I have been offered are purely on the basis of my performance. All my characters have always been very strong on the screen and it has never happened that I am being approached just for the bold scenes. How were you approached for Hai Taubba? You play a bisexual. What was your initial reaction to the role you were offered? I was approached at the very last moment for the role in Hai Taubba. The rest of the team had already finished shooting 1 sequence in Delhi till then. So I had to start with the shoot immediately after I was cast for it. This left me with very little time to prepare for the role. I prepared for the script in the very limited time that I had. However, I must say that the character that I play on screen is that of a very strong and empowered woman and I was able to do justice to it. People are loving my character and I have heard some great reviews. This could only have been possible because of my crew and the amazing co-stars. Every character that an actor plays on screen has its own challenges. And playing a bisexual character on screen comes with its own set of preconceived notions and judgments. As a society, we still haven't fully accepted people with alternate sexuality. So it becomes difficult to accept such characters on screen as well. When you are a part of a show whose storyline revolves around bisexuality and same-sex partners it becomes essential to be very sensitive in the way you perform it on screen. Anything that you say or do shouldn't affect your audience in the wrong way. Also, it is important for the audience to accept such characters with an open mindset. A person's sexual needs are very sacrosanct to himself/ herself. I believe nobody should be judged or grouped on the basis of it. I always believe in researching a lot before portraying a character on screen. But with Hai Tauba, I was cast at the last minute and that did not leave me with much of time to prepare for my role. However, I had played a character of a homosexual girl before and that came to my help. Also the entire lockdown I had spent a lot of time watching movies and series, trying to understand the different emotions and shades of the characters. All this helped me to play my part in Hai Tauba. It is one of my best-played characters till date. A post shared by Amika Shail (@amikashail) How does your family react to your choice of roles? My family has always been my great support. As I have already mentioned that my decision to come to Mumbai was overnight. It would not have been possible without my parent's support. I come from a middle-class family and my mother helped me with her savings money when I told her about my plans to go to Mumbai. Other than my parents I do not give much importance to what my relatives have to say about my acting skills or the kind of roles that I perform on screen. I discuss all my roles with my parents. It is never that any of my roles have come as a surprise for them. They have always believed in me and my decisions. They have been like a guide to me. Whenever I am in a soup and unable to take a decision I definitely discuss it with them and they show me the way forward. They have always asked me to remain focused on my goal and keep putting in my efforts for the same. Do you think issues like LGBTQ, Women's Right, and Gender Issues often made a mockery of on our small screen? LGBTQ , Women's Right and Gender issues have always been in the limelight on the screen whether big or small. Yes, earlier they were made mockery off. The way these issues were portrayed on screen was very conventional and stereotyped. But things have changed now. Especially after the advent of OTT platforms. They are open to experimenting with different kinds of stories and varied characters. The way they bring out these issues on the screen has also changed. Most of such relationships shown on screen are not just for showing sexual inclinations but also for giving out a strong message to society. Also most of the time it is the main or lead character of the series that is shown having alternate sexual preferences. That also helps in giving out a strong message to the audience. I have also played similar kinds of roles. My character in Gandi Baat 5 was a lesbian and the one in Hai Taubba is a bisexual. But both the characters are very strong, they are very empowering and they do not fear coming out as somebody that has alternate sexual preferences. They are very open, vocal and confident about it. So I believe, things are changing for good and people are also welcoming this change.  ","

827,2021-10-01,11:00:00,entertainment,television,"""There's no competition for me""; Mohit Malik after winning Promising Actor award [Exclusive]"," Mohit Malik is riding high on the success of his shows and how! The actor recently won the Most Promising Actor of the Year award in the television industry. International Business Times got in touch with the actor to talk about winning the award and how much it means to him. When the competition is so fierce, how does it feel to win the Best Actor award? Don't want to sound pompous but I think there is no competition for me in the industry. I don't feel any sort of competition. I know where I stand, and where I am at, today. So there is no fierce competition. I am not in the race. Do you think awards give one a sense of validation? It all depends on whether or not you are seeking that validation. If you want to take that validation, you can take. If you get an award, take the validation. But, if not, don't run behind it. That's what I do. What does winning an award mean to you? Winning an award always is a great feeling. But, when you don't you always tell yourself that your work matters more. One then comprises with it. But, when you get an award it's a great feeling. It is an absolutely overwhelming feeling. You know that your work has been awarded, it has been rewarded. People have seen your work and it is being honoured. It gives you a sense of motivation to work harder and win more. It does give you a high. But, I try not to get too attached to awards. A post shared by Mohit Malik (@mohitmalik1113) At a time when so much is said about awards being rigged, how much value do you associate with an award? As I said, when you get it, you attach value to it. When you don't get an award, you don't keep it high on the pedestal. When I work, my intention is not to bring an award home. My intention is to better myself as an actor and do something creative on that particular day that satisfies me. And I am always seeking to learn something. So, an award is never the goal for me. It will always remain a by-product. My goal is to better myself as an actor, to work on my craft, to learn more. Awards come and go, I don't attach myself to it. Lastly, apart from awards, what are the other things that keep you motivated to do better work? It's very few times, in a year that I feel I need the motivation to do better work. Otherwise, I am very passionate about my work. I know where I stand and how to improve myself, where do I need to work on myself. You keep learning every day. I don't see myself as an actor who has achieved a lot and it is not something that you finish learning. It's a day-to-day thing, you keep on learning about emotions, portrayal, and more. I am quite fond of acting so I don't need any motivation. But, when I need motivation, great work in cinema gives me great motivation. Watching exemplary actors like late Irrfan Khan gives me motivation. He was my all-time favorite and that's where I would like to head. I think he was the only actor who really knew his job and he was so skilled that he looked so effortless. Good performances keep me motivated.","

828,2021-10-01,10:04:00,entertainment,television,"""I was inside Bigg Boss house because of Sara Khan; was mentally disturbed"": Ali Merchant [Exclusive]"," Ali Merchant is a name that needs no introduction. Merchant ruled the hearts of small screen audiences for almost a decade before bidding goodbye to television. Now a renowned DJ, Ali is all set to make a comeback. IBTimes India got in touch with Ali to talk about shift from acting to DJing, Bigg Boss and Sara Khan. What have you been up to? It has been just work and lots of work. Not in the acting field though. I was working for a corporate which was really far from the place I stay. It used to take me around 4-5 hours one side to reach my office. I was the Vice President of Marketing which also required me to undertake a lot of national and international tours. I did this for two years. That gave me a lot of time to listen to international music and that is how I got attracted to music, understanding different music theories and learning different instruments. Although the money was pretty high in that job I decided to quit and then I got into DJing. It took me a lot of hard work and dedication. I do not know where it would take me. But I believe that if you keep on focusing then things will keep on happening. I did a Guru Randhawa India tour. That really helped me. I faced a 40 – 50 thousand audience. A big thanks to him as well. After that, I have worked with multiple artists- like Daljit Dosanj, Bpraak etc. Despite giving such memorable performances, where have you disappeared? To be honest I wasn't looking towards acting as a career for the past few years. I was quite volatile because I believe in focusing on one particular career at one time. I remember from 2017-2020, I have had almost 50 offers from television. I know how difficult it is to put down those many offers, when, on the other hand, many people really wanted to do those things. I did hear a lot of scripts and I was attracted to getting into acting. But then I used to calm myself that if I go into acting, then the efforts that I have already put into becoming a successful DJ will go in vain. Then, Covid happened and I got a lot of time to think and evaluate my options. Then I finished around 7- 8 originals of mine with 40-45 mashups. And, that is sufficient content for the next two years. So, I am pretty sorted that ways and now I am willing to get back into acting. How has the shift from acting to being a DJ been like? The shift has been very difficult. There are a lot of people who keep asking me why I left acting. Why don't I get back. But I had made up my mind. I believe Djing is also a very successful career if you take it seriously because of the way the hospitality industry has been. DJs themselves are a different breed of stars and celebrities. Whatever they perform is live. It was not very easy because initially, I took time to understand music, to understand the crowd, to understand different cities of India. Everywhere things are so different. It was surely a huge task but then I understood that once I complete covering up and going to cities a few times, I might just be a master in the skill . That is what exactly happened. A lot happened when you were in Bigg Boss. Did it play a good part in your life or a bad one? Well, I was there as a guest in Bigg Boss house. And when you are there as a guest that is for a particular reason. The reason then was Sara. I always have this thing that I should have been there as a contestant and not because of someone else. People who saw those episodes when I was there inside the BB house for 10-15 days, tell me that we really loved the way you perform and all those stuff. But I was there because I was emotionally disturbed at that time. It wasn't like I am there working for the trophy. That is something I always feel bad about. I should have been there after doing so much in life and getting all the success. I want to be there as myself and not because of someone else. How is your equation with Sara Khan now? Are you two in touch? We are not really in touch but, if ever bump into each other it would be normal 'hi', 'hello', and casual greetings. Both of us are grownups now. What do you have to say about Karan Johar's style of hosting? Karan Johar is good. He is being himself. But, I feel, he is better as a producer and a director. With all due respect, he is really good at that work. But as a host, I love Salman Bhai's style. Noting beats the way he handles the scenes or situation.","

Starring Lara Dutta, the series received rave reviews from critics. The audience too can't seem to wait for the next season of the show. IB Times India got in touch with the director to talk about the sequel, working with Lara Dutta, future projects, and more. Your web series - Hundred - was well received. There has been a wide buzz around the show's second part. In a recent interview, even Lara Dutta said part 2 of 'Hundred' will happen soon. Is there going to be a sequel? We are developing a few ideas and concepts about where the second season should go. If we and Hotstar are convinced we will definitely develop it further. The show was one of its kind. A lot of viewers have reached out demanding the second season. So I would say, ""never say never"". How was it working with Lara Dutta on the show? In the show, Lara played this tough cop who had a very serious demeanor. On the sets though, she was very chilled out. We directed her in some of the toughest sequences of the show. She is one of the hardest working professionals I have worked with. We shot these really heavy action sequences in 100-year-old mills in Mumbai. Then, there was a flash mob sequence that had 500 dancers dressed as police officers and was shot inside a railway station. It was shot in just 1 take and with more than 8 cameras. Lara had completely different energy altogether. She has this raw and organic talent that makes her stand out. A post shared by Lara Dutta Bhupathi (@larabhupathi) You got a chance to work with Shah Rukh Khan, Priyanka Chopra, and Kareena Kapoor (Shiksha Ka Suraj – Music Video on Adult Literacy) early on in your career. Could you share your experience? Shiksha ka Suraj was hailed as the new mile sur mera tumhara of the millennium. It was a magnum opus as we shot all over India and with some of the biggest actors who were sweet enough to be a part of it. SRK, PC and Kareena have seen me and Taher since our early working days and have always shown their faith in us. They have been extremely supportive. I call SRK fondly as the principal of the school we go to, that is, film making. There is so much to learn from each one of them. You have worked with top actors in your career like (Salman Khan, Hritik Roshan, Farhan Akhtar, Irfan Khan, and Vidya Balan). How comfortable were you working with these legendary artists at such a young age? I can definitely say that we have been extremely fortunate. All these legendary actors have always made us feel comfortable directing them. Each one of them brings their own work culture and style. The meticulousness of Hrithik, the spontaneity of Salman sir, the ease which Irrfan sir had and the joy of working with someone like Farhan is unique. Tell us something about your upcoming projects. When would we see you directing a feature film? Very soon, hopefully, we should be on floors early next year. We are currently developing and working on multiple projects. One is a love story that has been fantastically written by the acclaimed writer Ruchi Narain. Another one is a story of two best friends and is an out-and-out family entertainer. The last one is big in scale and is currently in research.","

Well, that may sound funny on paper but the film was a landmark in Indian cinema. Breaking away from the hero-centric formula, Eega was a visual marvel on screen. Though a sequel is on cards for a long time, it might take a little more time. Post RRR, the director is teaming up with Mahesh Babu for an action drama. Magadheera We can easily say this epic love story was the base for Baahubali. This fantasy drama too dealt with the story of reincarnation. A bike stuntman recollects events from his past life as a warrior and decides to pursue his love. Meanwhile, the villain from his past life reappears again. The movie marked the first onscreen collaboration of Ram Charan and SS Rajamouli. Magadheera was also the most expensive South Indian film made at the time of its release. Sye The film is centred around Rugby and to date, this is the only film to have Rugby as its main theme. A college sports drama with a high-intensity action sequence. Maryada Ramana This comedy-drama has been remade in Hindi, Tamil, Malayalam and Bengali. After the massive success of Magadheera, Rajamouli surprised everyone by announcing comedian Sunil as the protagonist for his next project. With a solid script, the right comedy timings and an extraordinary technical team, he made it a massive success. Chatrapathi The film marked the onscreen collaboration of Rajamouli and Prabhas. Chatrapathi gave Prabhas the larger than life image. Prabhas played the role of a vagabond turned gangster to perfection and was a phenomenal success at the box office. Simhadri And finally, we have the onscreen potboiler that laid a strong foundation for Tarak aka NTR Jr in Tollywood. The film smashed all previous box office records in Telugu cinema and is often known as the perfect Telugu commercial entertainer. So until the release of RRR on March 25, fans can binge-watch these flick to keep the pace up.","

Check out what he director wrote on Instagram: ""I still have our WhatsApp chats.. hadn't opened it for a long time.. but today.. i just wanted to hear his voice again. When I read his messages ... In my head it still plays out in his voice.. with his way of articulating those words. Just went through all the chats again .. and what I observed today.. is the number of times he has referred to me by my name.. not many do that .. but in most of his texts...  He has typed ""pavan"" .. and I just want to treasure these two text exchanges here... And share with you all ... I am glad that all my memories with him have been about making great films... I am glad that he felt I was worthy to share those dreams with me.. it's a huge privilege. The man has left... But he told many of us his dreams... And maybe it is a responsibility to not just miss him or remember him.. but to make those dreams come true... Maybe that's why he kept telling it out .. so we know we got to do it.

The last movie of Sandalwood's Power Star has been overwhelmingly received by the fans of the actor. Massive Release The movie was released in a record number of screens and an estimation states that the movie had close to 900 shows in multiplexes across the country. In Karnataka alone, James saw the light of the day in over 400 single screens. As this is the last movie of Appu, the fans thronged into theatres in big numbers. Single screens started special shows as early as 1.30 am and had five to six shows while multiplexes in Karnataka dedicated for Puneeth Rajkumar-starrer due to the unprecedented craze.

866,2022-03-18,11:29:36,entertainment,south-cinema,Salute movie review: Dulquer Salmaan's film is an engaging thriller with an unusual climax," Dulquer Salmaan's new movie Salute directed by Rosshan Andrews has been released on Sony Liv. Scripted by acclaimed writers Bobby and Sanjay, the film features Dulquer Salmaan in the role of an investigative cop for the first time in his career. Just like Rosshan Andrews' Mumbai Police, this movie too revolves around the life of police officers who engage in a murder investigation.  Dulquer Salmaan's Salute is thrilling Dulquer Salmaan's Salute begins in a very slow manner, where his character Aravind Karunakaran, who is currently on leave visits a police station in search of a previous crime file. Later, the film switches to flashback scenes, where we will come to know why Dulquer's character takes leave from the department. Even though the film had several unwanted cliched sequences involving Aravind Karunakaran's family, Rosshan Andrews succeeds in finding the top gear post the murder scene of a couple. However, the director did not show the backdrop of the murder, instead, he focussed more on the lives of police officers who are involved in the investigation.  The investigation procedure seems familiar, but the treatment adopted by Rosshan Andrews in these scenes will literally glue the viewers in their seats.  The climax: Awesome for many, ordinary for some After a routine investigation, the police officers reached the doorsteps of the criminal. But later, audiences were pulled to a state of shock, as Rosshan Andrews did something unimaginable which no other Mollywood director has done so far. He ended the movie in a very different manner, and sometimes, it will not impress a section of audiences, as they want all the questions to get answered as the credits start rolling.  Dulquer Salmaan did a perfect job as Aravind Karunakaran, a young sub-inspector who faces emotional trauma while investigating a case. All the other supporting actors including Manoj K Jayan, Binu Pappan, and Saniya Iyappan did justice to their roles. Diana Penty who made her Mollywood debut with this film had nothing much to do.  Final Verdict Salute is a well-made thriller, and it has that uncompromising cinematic language of Rosshan Andrews. However, the climax of the film may disappoint a majority of the audience. ","

Initially, the team was planning for a grand audio launch event at a popular engineering college in Chennai. However, now it seems producers Sun Pictures have other plans. Reportedly, the audio launch event has been called off which means fans will be missing Thalapathy's politically-toned speech. Instead, the team is planning to host a series of pre-release events in Chennai, Hyderabad, Kochi, Bangalore and Mumbai. Vijay and his team will be travelling to all cities to meet his fans. #ArabicKuthu #Beast https://t.co/g5zbxuFjeK Directed by Nelson Dilipkumar, the film also stars Pooja Hegde and Selvaraghavan in pivotal roles. The film is scheduled to hit the screens on April 14 clashing with Yash's KGF 2.

The star-cast also includes Prakash Raj, Yogi Babu, Redin Kingsley, Bjorn Surrao, VTV Ganesh, Aparna Das, Shine Tom Chacko, Lilliput Faruqui, Ankur Ajit Vikal and others. Well, it looks like Vijay fans are likely to miss his speech this time, however, we bring you five speeches of Vijay that hinted at his political ambition: ""Kill them with your success, bury them with your smile"" At Masters audio launch, the actor narrated a small story where he compared human lives with rivers. When a river flows, it gets different types of welcome, positive as well as negative. So let's face negativity with silence. He asked his fans, ""Kill the negativity with success and bury it with a smile."" He further added, ""When we know we are right, silence is the best answer."" When the host quipped about what he misses in life from 20 years back, he took a sly dig at the political atmosphere of the state, ""peace of mind and the stress-free life without worrying about IT raids."" And the fans went crazy! #BeastFromApril pic.twitter.com/UpzQJ78NH8 ""Tear my posters but don't touch my fans"" At the Bigil audio launch, Vijay got a little philosophical, ""Life is like a football game. We try to score a goal, people try to block us. Sometimes, the ones in our team put the same side goal. No matter what happens, and how tough life becomes, one shouldn't imitate others."" Addressing the Subhshree death incident, he said ""They have arrested the banner printers rather than the one who kept the banner. That is why we should know how to keep the right person in the right position."" And finally, when asked about the problems faced by his film often, he said, ""You can tear my banners and posters but don't dare to touch my fans."" #BeastSecondLook pic.twitter.com/L3yEgAXuX5 ""Let's overcome all those forces that pull us down."" At the Mersal audio launch, Vijay advised his fans to ignore criticism and negativity. This was in response to a controversy where his fans verbally accused a lady journalist. ""People often ask how do I handle negativity. My answer is simple, just ignore and move ahead. People may keep shouting unwantedly but eventually, get tired and stop. I have experienced this personally. Let us not react to unwanted things. Let's overcome all those forces that pull us down."" He further added that life will be boring without criticism. ""Let a few dislike us or else life will be very boring."" #Beast pic.twitter.com/VgMlmH1Gno ""If you like our film, do vote."" Sarkar audio launch was one venue where the actor openly flaunted his political ambitions. When asked about whether he would become a real-life chief minister, the actor said, ""If I become the Chief Minister, then I won't just act like one, but will do my job with sincerity."" Further hinting about a possible political stint, he added, ""Usually, Sarkars are formed after winning polls but here we are going to form Sarkar and then contest—I am just talking about the film. If you like our film, do vote."" Thank you Neyveli pic.twitter.com/cXQC8iPukl ""I may not be a thyagi, but I am not a drohi"" Vijay's Kaththi faced huge backlash for its association with Lyca Entertainment. There was a rumour stating Lyca is backed up by Sri Lankan President Rajapakshe. Addressing the issue, the actor said, ""I am a Tamilian and I work here. I may not be a thyagi but I am not a drohi. People are questioning my silence. I can clarify truths but if I clarify rumours, it will become true.","

The film, upon its release, received positive responses from all corners, and audiences are lauding the makers for handling such a theme with perfection on screen. However, the latest reports suggest that the film is being screened on a very less number of screens in Kerala, and several people are calling it an 'unofficial ban', due to the subject it handles.  Mohanlal trolled for not screening movies in Aashirvad Cinemas According to the latest updates, The Kashmir Files is being screened only in nine theaters in the southern state.  Even though netizens are urging theater owners to screen this movie in more theaters, the film is still running on selected multiplex screens in cities like Cochin, Thiruvananthapuram, and Thrissur.  Meanwhile, a section of social media users has now started criticizing Superstar Mohanlal for not screening The Kashmir Files in Aashirvad Cinemas. It should be noted that the theater chain has screens in almost all districts, but none of these screens are screening the Bollywood movie.  According to these critics, Mohanlal is a person who holds an honorary lieutenant colonel title, but still, he is reluctant to screen a film like The Kashmir Files in his theaters.  The Kashmir Files is based on the exodus of Kashmiri Pandits during the Kashmir Insurgency. The film stars Anupam Kher, Darshan Kumar, Mithun Chakraborty, and Pallavi Joshi in the lead roles.  Unofficial ban: Not a new thing in Kerala Unofficial ban of films is not a new thing in Kerala. In 2013, Arun Gopy's Left Right Left which tried to explore the ugly side of communism had also faced a similar fate. Despite receiving positive reviews from critics and audiences alike, the film was removed from almost all theaters in the state.  At that time, several critics alleged that threats from CPI(M) had compelled theaters to remove the film from the screens.  As the controversies surrounding The Kashmir Files heat up, it is still unclear whether more theaters in Kerala will express their readiness to screen the movie.  Fall of Mohanlal?

It is an action thriller written and directed by Karthick Naren. The T. Thyagarajan, Sendhil Thyagarajan and Arjun Thyagarajan-funded movie has Malavika Mohanan playing the female lead. Samuthirakani enacts the role of an antagonist while Smruthi Venkat, Ramki, Jayaprakash, Aadukalam Naren, Ameer and others are in the supporting cast. The film has Vivekanand Santhosham's cinematography, Prasanna GK's editing and GV Prakash Kumar's music. Maaran Story: It is a typical 80s story of a boy (Mathimaaran aka Maaran), who loses his parents when his kid and is responsible to raise his sister. He is inspired by his father's life and follows the righteous path. He becomes an investigate journalist and enjoys his thrilling life. His life goes for a change after exposing a politician (played by Samuthirakani) over EVM rigging. This lands him in trouble and What will happen when such a risky business starts taking a toll on his life forms the crux of the story. The Dhanush-starrer movie has been criticised by netizens for its outdated story and poor screenplay. Except for Dhanush's performance and music, the film has not much to win the viewers' appreciation. Even Malavika Mohanan's character is wasted in the Tamil flick. Check out netizens' comments: sridevi sreedhar: #Maaran : 3/5 It is @dhanushkraja and his earnest performance that saves this mass masala from @karthicknaren_M #ThangachiPaasam the age old formula in Tamil cinema is the base of this film too. @SathyaJyothi CK Review: #Maaran (Tamil|2022) - HOTSTAR. Outdated story & unexciting, illogical screenplay. Thr s a twist, but unfortunately it has no impact. Music ok. Nothing challenging for Dhanush. Smruthi gud. Malavika is chewing gum torture. Writing fails big time. Packed with silly scenes. BORE! Prince4211: #MaaranReview Worst film .. 1st half = serial 2nd half = continuation of that serial. Didn't expect this type of film from @dhanushkraja and @karthicknaren_M combo @dhanushkraja we don't want #maaran we want #Vetrimaaran film..

Directed by Radha Krishna Kumar, the romantic saga has been creating new records across the globe within hours of its release.

The huge star cast includes Bhagyashree, Sathyaraj, Jagapathi Babu, Sachin Khedekar and Priyadarshi. In India, the film is currently screened in five languages - Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada and Hindi. The film has already minted Rs. 200 crore plus in its pre-release business.

Released on over 3,000 screens, the film is said to have minted around Rs. 28 crore from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana box office, although official figures are yet to be revealed. Though it's breaking records at the box office, the film seems to have failed to win over the critics.

We have already reported that Pushpa girl Rashmika Mandanna will be pairing up with the actor for the first time on screen. While the makers have also approached Ajith's Vivegam villain, Vivek Oberoi to play the villain. Expected to go on floors on Ugadi, April 2, the team is looking for a Diwali or Pongal release. Interestingly, Ajith's next film tentatively titled AK61 is also looking for a Diwali release. The bank heist thriller is expected to go on floors on April 19. Helmed by H Vinoth, the film will bring back Ajith, the villain on screen. Will, there be an Ajith vs Vijay clash at the box office this Diwali? We will have to wait and watch. Though Ajith vs Vijay will be a clash of the titans at the box office, most of the time, filmmakers, producers and even the actors don't prefer the clash as it can eat up each other's business prospects. The last time the actors clashed at the box office was in 2014 Pongal. It was Ajith's Veeram vs Vijay's Jilla, and the rest is a known story. Their rivalry on-screen dates back to 1996 when Vijay's Coimbatore Mapla clashed with Ajith's Vanmathi. However, both the actors were struggling stars looking to crave a place for themselves. To be precise, a full-fledged fan war began only in 2001 when Ajith's Dheena clashed with Vijay's Friends. Interestingly, both the films opened with positive feedback and were a huge success. Dheena is indeed an important film in Ajith's career, probably the first time he was seen in a mass hero avatar. And of course, he was christened Thala after the film. The rivalry peaked with Villain vs Bhagavathi, Anjaneya vs Thirumalai, Paramasivan vs Aadhi, and Aalwar vs Pokiri. However, considering the post-pandemic situation of Kollywood, it is highly unlikely that the stars will agree to a clash. Trade pundits believe that dividing the number of screens will affect the collections of both flicks. Regardless of the financial analysis, fans are always excited for a box office clash and are keen to see their favourite actor win the race.","

The film has S Thaman's music, Manoj Paramahamsa's cinematography and Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao's editing. Story: The film is a musical love story set in the backdrop of Europe in the 1970's. It weaves in a heartwarming story which questions the foundations of Love, Human Nature, Science, Spirituality and Philosophy through a musical drama. It is the story of two individuals who are poles apart in terms of their ideologies, their belief system and the way they perceive life. It is the story of Vikramaditya and Prerna who are two diversified individuals. Vikram Aditya is an epitome of pure joy and innocence who believes in the language of stars, fate and destiny and lives every moment with vibrancy and passion. He is flirtatious with women, his charm is infectious and his charisma is captivating. Women adore him. He leads a life free of any commitments and believes in living each day as it comes. He is spontaneous, adventurous and happy-go-lucky. Prerna is someone who is a non-believer and believes more in science than in destiny and fate. She is believed to be rude sometimes to people around her, which is only an attempt to veil her real persona. What happens when their paths cross forms the crux of the story.

Bheeshma Parvam is only the 13th Malayalam film and the first Mammootty starter to reach the milestone.  According to Forum Keralam, a popular box office tracker in Mollywood, Bheeshma Parvam became the second-fastest entrant to the Rs. 50-crore club. The tracker also says the Mammootty-starrer has broken the opening weekend record of Mohanlal's Lucifer and Prabhas' Baahubali. Mohanlal's Lucifer is the highest-grossing Malayalam film of all time grossing Rs. 200 crore at the box office. Now with Bheeshma Parvam, the age-old fan war between Mohanlal and Mammootty has been rekindled. Interestingly, Mammootty had no release in 2021 except the political thriller One. With the Kerala government relaxing covid rules with full theatre occupancy, the film's run at the box office seems unstoppable. And it's not just the numbers, the film has received a thumbs up from critics too. Directed by Amal Neerad, Mammootty enacts the role of a don, Micheal, who is also the head of a large family. And the story revolves around how Micheal handles the family feud, the consequences of the crimes he committed, and the vengeance. The film is also a tribute to Francis Ford Coppola's trademark mafia flick, The Godfather, which is also an adaptation of Mari Puzo's iconic novel. Despite its influence, writer Devadath Shaji has managed to script Bheeshma Parvam with its own identity. The star cast includes Soubin Shahir, Sreenath Bhasi, Shine Tom Chacko, Nadhiya, Harish Uthaman, Anasuya Bharadwaj, Dileesh Pothan and others. Meanwhile, the star has already begun the shooting of his next, also a spy thriller. Titled Agent, the film will be a Telugu-Malayalam bilingual with Akhil Akkineni in a major role. The film is directed by Surender and produced jointly by AK Entertainments and Surrender 2 Cinema. Also, rumours are rife that the actor will essay the role of a military officer in this thriller. In Malayalam, the 70-year-old star will be teaming up with Anwar Rasheed for an action drama and Amal Neerad is expected to crank the camera. After the highly celebrated Rajamanikyam, Mammootty-Anwar Rasheed pairing is definitely an awaited combination.","

Along with the Tamil, the dubbed versions will be released simultaneously in Telugu, Malayalam, Hindi and Kannada on March 10. In Karnataka, the film will be shown on 300 screens, the highest ever for a Suriya film. However, in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, the film will face tough stiff from Prabha's Radhe Shyam, which is making to the screens on March 11. Call for boycotting Etharkkum Thunindhavan Directed by Pandiraj, the film also stars Priyanka Arul, Vinay, Sathyaraj, and Rajkiran in pivotal roles. The action-drama is Suriya's landmark 40th film and fourth collaboration with Pandiraj who is known for his action-packed family entertainers. Meanwhile, the student wing leader of Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) has called for a boycott of the film. The actor, who has a long-standing tiff with PMK, is yet to respond to the issue. Vijayvarman, the Cuddalore district secretary of the PMK student wing, has written a letter to the Theatre Owners' Association in the district, asking for a boycott of the film. Suriya faced the wrath of PMK leaders after the release of his critically-acclaimed Jai Bhim. The film portrays the struggle of the Irular community for an identity. Immediately after the release of the film, the party objected to its portrayal of the vanniyar community. In a letter written to the Theatres Association, Vijayvarman mentions, ""While advocate Chandru was portrayed in the same name, as all other characters except SI Anthonysamy, a Dalit Christian, who alone was portrayed as Gurumoorthy, a Vanniyar. The police sub-inspector has been portrayed as a casteist and as a Vanniyar by showcasing the symbol of the community, agni kalasam, in his home. And they have portrayed the entire Vanniyar community people as casteists."" The party also claims it as an attempt to malign their name and fame. Based on a few real-life incidents, Jai Bhim created quite an uproar during its release. PMK cadres tried to stop the screening at a few places. Later, Suriya released a statement clarifying that the team has no intentions of hurting any particular community's sentiments. Meanwhile, producer Gnanavel Raja replaced the image of agni kalasam with goddess Lakshmi to avoid any further controversies.","

They have divorced with mutual consent. Lived Separately for Years As per the reports, a family court granted divorce for Bala and Muthumalar on March 5. The former couple had been living separately for over four years and eventually decided to break their marriage. The news of their divorce has come as a shock as the fans had not seen it coming. Bala had tied the knot with Muthumalar in 2004 in a traditional ceremony. They have a daughter named Prarthana. In recent history, there are a few notable marriages that have ended in divorce. Celeb Divorces Notably, Samantha parted ways with Naga Chaitanya to end their four-year marriage. Also, Dhanush and Aishwarya Rajinikanth announced their separation a few months ago. On Work Front Coming back to Bala, the director is hoping to bounce back with his next flick with Suriya. The National Award-winning filmmaker suffered a major setback a few years ago after he was unceremoniously removed as a director from the Tamil remake of Telugu blockbuster Arjun Reddy. It was a debut movie of Vikram's son Dhruva. As the makers were not happy with the output, Bala was thrown out of the film and replaced with another filmmaker. It was seen as an insult to a man, who had delivered movies like Sethu, Pithamagan, and Naan Kadavaul. Now, Bala is gearing up for Suriya's next movie. The director has completed the script work much earlier than predicted and the song composing for 4-5 is also over. Reportedly, Suriya will be seen as deaf and dumb in the film, which will be funded by his 2D Entertainment.",author not available,https://www.ibtimes.co.in/award-winning-filmmaker-balas-marriage-muthumalar-ends-divorce-846390
886,2022-03-03,16:29:55,entertainment,south-cinema,Bheeshma Parvam review: Mammootty's film is a poor blend of Godfather and Mahabharata," After months of anxious wait, Bheeshma Parvam, Mollywood megastar Mammootty's most-anticipated movie of the year has hit the theaters. Directed by Amal Neerad, this film marked the reunion of the filmmaker with Mammootty after Big B, a film that set new standards in Mollywood. However, when it comes to Bheeshma Parvam, Amal Neerad has completely disappointed the audiences, and the only two things worth the money in this movie are its rich visuals and splendid background score.  Bheeshma Parvam: A blend of Godfather and Mahabharata Mammootty's Bheeshma Parvam follows the routine style of all gangster movies. Heavily inspired by Godfather and Mahabharata, the film is literally predictable in its proceedings.  After raising the expectations sky-high in the first two scenes, the latter part of the first half literally runs like a snail. The second half too seems cliched with unnecessary slow-motion scenes, a trademark of Amal Neerad movies.  Shine Tom Chacko shines, Mammootty puts up an average show Mammootty is one such actor who is capable to portray all kinds of shows with perfection on screen. However, when it comes to Bheeshma Parvam, the actor did an average job, and the problems associated with his age are clearly evident in each scene.  It was Shine Tom Chacko who excelled in the movie. In one particular scene with Ramzan Mohammed, Shine Tom Chacko literally impressed the viewers with his impeccable acting skills.  As always, the technical side of this movie is strong. The music from Sushin Shyam is scintillating, and the cinematography was excellent.  Final Verdict Bheeshma Parvam is a movie that is rich in its technical sides. However, this Mammotty film does not have a script or story that could glue the audiences on their theater seats. Even though the film is set in the 80s, there are several modern colloquial usages in this movie, and it makes audiences wonder how a filmmaker like Amal Neerad can commit such blatant mistakes on screen. ","

The Tamil film has made a record-breaking collection at the worldwide box office in seven days. Valimai 1st Week Collection Valimai was released on February 25 to a gigantic hype. Originally, it was scheduled for release in January for the Pongal festival. Unfortunately, the release was postponed due to the third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, the hype continued to build and single screens and multiplexes cashed in the craze by dedicating the maximum number of shows and screens for Ajith Kumar's flick. As a result, the Tamil flick, which finally had a non-holiday release, made a superb collection across the centres. As per the movie publicity Ramesh Bala, Valimai has made Rs 100 crore alone at the Tamil Nadu box office. This by any parameter, is a huge number. Valimai Box Office Collection Overall in India, Valimai has collected Rs 122 crore while adding Rs 43 crore at the overseas box office. He claims that the worldwide collection of Ajith's flick stands at Rs 165 crore. As per the trader trackers, Valimai has managed to pull the audience to theatres of all age group.

""The content (of Valimai) is not something that the Hindi audience has not seen (before). Bollywood has been making hardcore commercial entertainers with fast-paced, sleek action sequences.

Yes, the Young Superstar will be hosting the OTT show from this week.

898,date not available,time not available,entertainment,south-cinema,"Bheemla Nayak Opens to Positive Reviews: What's Good, What's Bad in Pawan Kalyan, Rana-starrer; Find out"," Pawan Kalyan and Rana Daggubati's Bheemla Nayak, which was released on Friday, February 25, has opened to positive reviews. The Telugu flick has been hailed for the extraordinary screen presence of the leads stars, punch dialogues and action. Bheemla Nayak is an official remake of Malayalam hit film Ayyappanum Koshiyum. However, the makers have just retained the skelton from the original while liberally making changes in the overall content. It has been adapted keeping the tastes of Telugu and notably Pawan Kalyan fans in mind. The story deals around two egoistic persons – a sub inspector and the son of former MP. The war between the two begins once the former arrests the latter for illegally bringing liquor from Telangana to AP. The fans are overjoyed to find their favourite heroes in massy avatars in the out-and-out commercial entertainer. The face-off between Pawan Kalyan and Rana Daggubati remains one of the major highlights of the movie. Trivikram's writing deserves a special mention. On the flip side, the forceful inclusion of politically charged dialogues and the climax are major disappointments. Check Out How Netizens Have Responded to Bheemla Nayak:  Sushanth Reddy: Interval. Tightly packed first half. Pawan Kalyan and Rana set the screen on fire !!!! la la song comes at right time at right place, sigle screens will explode. #BheemlaNayak Decent 2nd half with nice climax, a change from original that actually worked. #BheemlaNayak is perfectly remade as a telugu commercial cinema. This is Pawan Kalyan's best outing since Attarintiki Dared, he rocked it and so did Rana. Go watch the fireworks!! Great screenplay by Trivikram... some bit of novelty is gone but good commercial packing. I'm so glad Rana's character isn't diluted. Thaman killed it with his score. #BheemlaNayak opens post pandemic era (hopefully) with a bang !! Anil Ravipudi: An Absolute Powerful and Intense Performance by Powerstar @PawanKalyan garu & The way he carried #BheemlaNayak character is just outstanding! The stellar performance @RanaDaggubati on screen! Excellent BGM of @MusicThaman elevated the scenes! Terrific work by #Trivikram garu, @saagar_chandrak. Congratulations @vamsi84 Venky Reviews@venkyreviews·13h#BheemlaNayak A Good Mass Commercial Entertainer The 1st half is somewhat slow and could've been better but is pretty engaging. The 2nd half is engaging throughout and had some goosebump sequences Feast for fans and masses. General audience will like it too Rating: 3.25/5 Ramesh Bala: #BheemlaNayak [3.5/5] : Casting a role opposite to #PSPK is a tough task.. @RanaDaggubati does an admirable job and contributes big time to the success of this movie with his fearless acting.. Siddarth Srinivas: #BheemlaNayak: Big and ferocious. A superbly made mass movie where @PawanKalyan activates beast mode and @RanaDaggubati is the perfect adversary to him. The intense fever is held up throughout the film, along with some sharp dialogues and good action. Worth a watch for sure! sridevi sreedhar@sridevisreedhar·1h#BheemlaNayak is a rock solid entertainer. Unlike the original, this one is more mass, racy and is a blast @PawanKalyan is in full form and @RanaDaggubati is extraordinary  #Trivikram @MusicThaman @dop007  Maduri Mattaiah@madurimadhu1·2h#BheemlaNayak shows #pawankalyan massive strength once again Powerstar mass hysteria peaks..@PawanKalyan performance on fire  Also tailor made character done by @RanaDaggubati very well his combination scenes with #PawanKalyan are terrific Trivikram dilouges Sai Suraj@saisuraj143·12hBrilliant performance from @RanaDaggubati steals the show and next @PawanKalyan powerful presence made it roller coaster ride. Spl thanks to @MusicThaman he is on steroids  BGM top notch . Director Sagar K Chandra direction  and Guruji dailogues . #BheemlaNayak Kaushik LM: A-K's Biju Menon is a dream part for any mass hero; cool, patient but also extremely dangerous when provoked. In #BheemlaNayak, the mass aggression part takes prominence & #PSPK owns it with his trademark attitude, screen presence & demigod elevations 1st half itself PAISAVASOOL #BheemlaNayak: The epic 1on1 climax fight was a big highlight in A-K. Here, it powers-up with massive elevations for #PSPK but is then diluted needlessly with sentiments & a feelgood light ending! @RanaDaggubati the performer is in full flow despite the huge shadow of #Powerstar #BheemlaNayak: a much shorter, extremely massy version of the Malayalam classic A-K Loved the 1st half The 2nd half is hurried & doesn't maintain the high level; loses power towards the end! Demigod level elevations for #PSPK. Get massified. His fans would love this, fullon!  ",author not available,https://www.ibtimes.co.in/bheemla-nayak-opens-positive-reviews-whats-good-whats-bad-pawan-kalyan-rana-starrer-find-out-846073
